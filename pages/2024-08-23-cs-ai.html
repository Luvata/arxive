<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurakt Kumar, Divyanshu Kumar, Jatan Loya, Nitin Aravind Birur, Tanay Baswa, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Alignment data Generation for Safety Evaluation and Red Teaming (SAGE-RT or SAGE) a novel pipeline for generating synthetic alignment and red-teaming data. Existing methods fall short in creating nuanced and diverse datasets, providing necessary control over the data generation and validation processes, or require large amount of manually generated seed data. SAGE addresses these limitations by using a detailed taxonomy to produce safety-alignment and red-teaming data across a wide range of topics. We generated 51,000 diverse and in-depth prompt-response pairs, encompassing over 1,500 topics of harmfulness and covering variations of the most frequent types of jailbreaking prompts faced by large language models (LLMs). We show that the red-teaming data generated through SAGE jailbreaks state-of-the-art LLMs in more than 27 out of 32 sub-categories, and in more than 58 out of 279 leaf-categories (sub-sub categories). The attack success rate for GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo is 100% over the sub-categories of harmfulness. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of synthetic safety-training data generation such as mode collapse and lack of nuance in the generation pipeline by ensuring a detailed coverage of harmful topics using iterative expansion of the topics and conditioning the outputs on the generated raw-text. This method can be used to generate red-teaming and alignment data for LLM Safety completely synthetically to make LLMs safer or for red-teaming the models over a diverse range of topics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julio Hernandez, Delaram Golpayegani, Dave Lewis</p>
<p>Abstract: The many initiatives on trustworthy AI result in a confusing and multipolar landscape that organizations operating within the fluid and complex international value chains must navigate in pursuing trustworthy AI. The EU's AI Act will now shift the focus of such organizations toward conformance with the technical requirements for regulatory compliance, for which the Act relies on Harmonized Standards. Though a high-level mapping to the Act's requirements will be part of such harmonization, determining the degree to which standards conformity delivers regulatory compliance with the AI Act remains a complex challenge. Variance and gaps in the definitions of concepts and how they are used in requirements between the Act and harmonized standards may impact the consistency of compliance claims across organizations, sectors, and applications. This may present regulatory uncertainty, especially for SMEs and public sector bodies relying on standards conformance rather than proprietary equivalents for developing and deploying compliant high-risk AI systems. To address this challenge, this paper offers a simple and repeatable mechanism for mapping the terms and requirements relevant to normative statements in regulations and standards, e.g., AI Act and ISO management system standards, texts into open knowledge graphs. This representation is used to assess the adequacy of standards conformance to regulatory compliance and thereby provide a basis for identifying areas where further technical consensus development in trustworthy AI value chains is required to achieve regulatory compliance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11936">Estimating Contribution Quality in Online Deliberations Using a Large Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lodewijk Gelauff, Mohak Goyal, Bhargav Dindukurthi, Ashish Goel, Alice Siu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deliberation involves participants exchanging knowledge, arguments, and perspectives and has been shown to be effective at addressing polarization. The Stanford Online Deliberation Platform facilitates large-scale deliberations. It enables video-based online discussions on a structured agenda for small groups without requiring human moderators. This paper's data comes from various deliberation events, including one conducted in collaboration with Meta in 32 countries, and another with 38 post-secondary institutions in the US.
  Estimating the quality of contributions in a conversation is crucial for assessing feature and intervention impacts. Traditionally, this is done by human annotators, which is time-consuming and costly. We use a large language model (LLM) alongside eight human annotators to rate contributions based on justification, novelty, expansion of the conversation, and potential for further expansion, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. Annotators also provide brief justifications for their ratings. Using the average rating from other human annotators as the ground truth, we find the model outperforms individual human annotators. While pairs of human annotators outperform the model in rating justification and groups of three outperform it on all four metrics, the model remains competitive.
  We illustrate the usefulness of the automated quality rating by assessing the effect of nudges on the quality of deliberation. We first observe that individual nudges after prolonged inactivity are highly effective, increasing the likelihood of the individual requesting to speak in the next 30 seconds by 65%. Using our automated quality estimation, we show that the quality ratings for statements prompted by nudging are similar to those made without nudging, signifying that nudging leads to more ideas being generated in the conversation without losing overall quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinendra Malekar, Mohammed E. Elbtity, Ramtin Zand Co</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of 1-bit large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable attention and opened up new research opportunities. However, 1-bit LLMs only improve a fraction of models by applying extreme quantization to the projection layers while leaving attention heads unchanged. Therefore, to avoid fundamentally wrong choices of goals in future research, it is crucial to understand the actual improvements in computation and memory usage that 1-bit LLMs can deliver. In this work, we present an adaptation of Amdahl's Law tailored for the 1-bit LLM context, which illustrates how partial improvements in 1-bit LLMs impact overall model performance. Through extensive experiments, we uncover key nuances across different model architectures and hardware configurations, offering a roadmap for future research in the era of 1-bit LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Abdelkareem, Shady Shehata, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms suffer from the dependency on accurately engineered reward functions to properly guide the learning agents to do the required tasks. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) addresses that by utilizing human preferences as feedback from the experts instead of numeric rewards. Due to its promising advantage over traditional RL, PbRL has gained more focus in recent years with many significant advances. In this survey, we present a unified PbRL framework to include the newly emerging approaches that improve the scalability and efficiency of PbRL. In addition, we give a detailed overview of the theoretical guarantees and benchmarking work done in the field, while presenting its recent applications in complex real-world tasks. Lastly, we go over the limitations of the current approaches and the proposed future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adilet Yerkin, Pakizar Shamoi, Elnara Kadyrgali</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's world, making decisions as a group is common, whether choosing a restaurant or deciding on a holiday destination. Group decision-making (GDM) systems play a crucial role by facilitating consensus among participants with diverse preferences. Discussions are one of the main tools people use to make decisions. When people discuss alternatives, they use natural language to express their opinions. Traditional GDM systems generally require participants to provide explicit opinion values to the system. However, in real-life scenarios, participants often express their opinions through some text (e.g., in comments, social media, messengers, etc.). This paper introduces a sentiment and emotion-aware multi-criteria fuzzy GDM system designed to enhance consensus-reaching effectiveness in group settings. This system incorporates natural language processing to analyze sentiments and emotions expressed in textual data, enabling an understanding of participant opinions besides the explicit numerical preference inputs. Once all the experts have provided their preferences for the alternatives, the individual preferences are aggregated into a single collective preference matrix. This matrix represents the collective expert opinion regarding the other options. Then, sentiments, emotions, and preference scores are inputted into a fuzzy inference system to get the overall score. The proposed system was used for a small decision-making process - choosing the hotel for a vacation by a group of friends. Our findings demonstrate that integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into GDM systems allows everyone's feelings and opinions to be considered during discussions and significantly improves consensus among participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingquan Wang, Harry Zhang, Huzaifa Mustafa Unjhawala, Peter Negrut, Shu Wang, Khailanii Slaton, Radu Serban, Jin-Long Wu, Dan Negrut</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SimBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of student large language models (S-LLMs) in generating digital twins (DTs) that can be used in simulators for virtual testing. Given a collection of S-LLMs, this benchmark enables the ranking of the S-LLMs based on their ability to produce high-quality DTs. We demonstrate this by comparing over 20 open- and closed-source S-LLMs. Using multi-turn interactions, SimBench employs a rule-based judge LLM (J-LLM) that leverages both predefined rules and human-in-the-loop guidance to assign scores for the DTs generated by the S-LLM, thus providing a consistent and expert-inspired evaluation protocol. The J-LLM is specific to a simulator, and herein the proposed benchmarking approach is demonstrated in conjunction with the Chrono multi-physics simulator. Chrono provided the backdrop used to assess an S-LLM in relation to the latter's ability to create digital twins for multibody dynamics, finite element analysis, vehicle dynamics, robotic dynamics, and sensor simulations. The proposed benchmarking principle is broadly applicable and enables the assessment of an S-LLM's ability to generate digital twins for other simulation packages.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12025">Exploring Large Language Models for Feature Selection: A Data-centric Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawei Li, Zhen Tan, Huan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly influenced various domains, leveraging their exceptional few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities. In this work, we aim to explore and understand the LLMs-based feature selection methods from a data-centric perspective. We begin by categorizing existing feature selection methods with LLMs into two groups: data-driven feature selection which requires samples values to do statistical inference and text-based feature selection which utilizes prior knowledge of LLMs to do semantical associations using descriptive context. We conduct extensive experiments in both classification and regression tasks with LLMs in various sizes (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT and LLaMA-2). Our findings emphasize the effectiveness and robustness of text-based feature selection methods and showcase their potentials using a real-world medical application. We also discuss the challenges and future opportunities in employing LLMs for feature selection, offering insights for further research and development in this emerging field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Young, Michael Witbrock</p>
<p>Abstract: Solomonoff Induction is an optimal-in-the-limit unbounded algorithm for sequence prediction, representing a Bayesian mixture of every computable probability distribution and performing close to optimally in predicting any computable sequence.
  Being an optimal form of computational sequence prediction, it seems plausible that it may be used as a model against which other methods of sequence prediction might be compared.
  We put forth and explore the hypothesis that Transformer models - the basis of Large Language Models - approximate Solomonoff Induction better than any other extant sequence prediction method. We explore evidence for and against this hypothesis, give alternate hypotheses that take this evidence into account, and outline next steps for modelling Transformers and other kinds of AI in this way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin He, Tong Nie, Wei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of generative AI in visual art has revolutionized not only how visual content is created but also how AI interacts with and reflects the underlying domain knowledge. This survey explores the emerging realm of diffusion-based visual art creation, examining its development from both artistic and technical perspectives. We structure the survey into three phases, data feature and framework identification, detailed analyses using a structured coding process, and open-ended prospective outlooks. Our findings reveal how artistic requirements are transformed into technical challenges and highlight the design and application of diffusion-based methods within visual art creation. We also provide insights into future directions from technical and synergistic perspectives, suggesting that the confluence of generative AI and art has shifted the creative paradigm and opened up new possibilities. By summarizing the development and trends of this emerging interdisciplinary area, we aim to shed light on the mechanisms through which AI systems emulate and possibly, enhance human capacities in artistic perception and creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ni Mu, Yao Luan, Yiqin Yang, Qing-shan Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) stands out by utilizing human preferences as a direct reward signal, eliminating the need for intricate reward engineering. However, despite its potential, traditional PbRL methods are often constrained by the indivisibility of annotations, which impedes the learning process. In this paper, we introduce a groundbreaking approach, Skill-Enhanced Preference Optimization Algorithm~(S-EPOA), which addresses the annotation indivisibility issue by integrating skill mechanisms into the preference learning framework. Specifically, we first conduct the unsupervised pretraining to learn useful skills. Then, we propose a novel query selection mechanism to balance the information gain and discriminability over the learned skill space. Experimental results on a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion, demonstrate that S-EPOA significantly outperforms conventional PbRL methods in terms of both robustness and learning efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of skill-driven learning in overcoming the challenges posed by annotation indivisibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yile Chen, Weiming Huang, Kaiqi Zhao, Yue Jiang, Gao Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of geospatial data in urban and territorial environments has significantly facilitated the development of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) across various urban applications. Given the vast yet inherently sparse labeled nature of geospatial data, there is a critical need for techniques that can effectively leverage such data without heavy reliance on labeled datasets. This requirement aligns with the principles of self-supervised learning (SSL), which has attracted increasing attention for its adoption in geospatial data. This paper conducts a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of SSL techniques applied to or developed for three primary data (geometric) types prevalent in geospatial vector data: points, polylines, and polygons. We systematically categorize various SSL techniques into predictive and contrastive methods, discussing their application with respect to each data type in enhancing generalization across various downstream tasks. Furthermore, we review the emerging trends of SSL for GeoAI, and several task-specific SSL techniques. Finally, we discuss several key challenges in the current research and outline promising directions for future investigation. By presenting a structured analysis of relevant studies, this paper aims to inspire continued advancements in the integration of SSL with GeoAI, encouraging innovative methods to harnessing the power of geospatial data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is an important research direction in the field of artificial intelligence. This article proposes a novel multi tool application framework for mathematical reasoning, aiming to achieve more comprehensive and accurate mathematical reasoning by utilizing the collaborative effect of large language models (LLMs) and multiple external tools. Firstly, use a Math Tool to perform basic mathematical calculations during the inference process through interaction with LLM. Secondly, Code Tool can generate code fragments that comply with syntax rules and execute them, providing support for complex mathematical problems. Then, through the iterative reasoning of the CoT Tool, the logical coherence and accuracy of mathematical reasoning are enhanced. Ultimately, by using self consistency tools to select the final answer based on different parameters, the consistency and reliability of reasoning are improved. Through the synergistic effect of these tools, the framework has achieved significant performance improvement in mathematical reasoning tasks. We conducted experiments on the NumGLUE Task 4 test set, which includes 220 mathematical reasoning fill in the blank questions. The experimental results showed that, based on Math Tool, Code Tool, and CoT Tool, in Task 4 task,our method achieved an accuracy of 89.09,compared with the GPT3+FewShot baseline, Few Shot+ERNIE-4.0+self consistency improved by 49.09%, and compared with fine-tuning the Fine tuning baseline, Few Shot+ERNIE-4.0+self consistency improved by 52.29%</p>

<p>Abstract: When it comes to the safety of cosmetic products, compliance with regulatory standards is crucialto guarantee consumer protection against the risks of skin irritation. Toxicologists must thereforebe fully conversant with all risks. This applies not only to their day-to-day work, but also to allthe algorithms they integrate into their routines. Recognizing this, ensuring the reproducibility ofalgorithms becomes one of the most crucial aspects to address.However, how can we prove the robustness of an algorithm such as the random forest, that reliesheavily on randomness? In this report, we will discuss the strategy of integrating random forest intoocular tolerance assessment for toxicologists.We will compare four packages: randomForest and Ranger (R packages), adapted in Python via theSKRanger package, and the widely used Scikit-Learn with the RandomForestClassifier() function.Our goal is to investigate the parameters and sources of randomness affecting the outcomes ofRandom Forest algorithms.By setting comparable parameters and using the same Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG),we expect to reproduce results consistently across the various available implementations of therandom forest algorithm. Nevertheless, this exploration will unveil hidden layers of randomness andguide our understanding of the critical parameters necessary to ensure reproducibility across all fourimplementations of the random forest algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xia Jiang, Yaoxin Wu, Yuan Wang, Yingqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, applying neural networks to address combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) has attracted considerable research attention. The prevailing methods always train deep models independently on specific problems, lacking a unified framework for concurrently tackling various COPs. To this end, we propose a unified neural combinatorial optimization (UNCO) framework to solve different types of COPs by a single model. Specifically, we use natural language to formulate text-attributed instances for different COPs and encode them in the same embedding space by the large language model (LLM). The obtained embeddings are further advanced by an encoder-decoder model without any problem-specific modules, thereby facilitating a unified process of solution construction. We further adopt the conflict gradients erasing reinforcement learning (CGERL) algorithm to train the UNCO model, delivering better performance across different COPs than vanilla multi-objective learning. Experiments show that the UNCO model can solve multiple COPs after a single-session training, and achieves satisfactory performance that is comparable to several traditional or learning-based baselines. Instead of pursuing the best performance for each COP, we explore the synergy between tasks and few-shot generalization based on LLM to inspire future work.</p>

To address these issues, this paper introduces MedDiT, a novel knowledge-controlled conversational framework that can dynamically generate plausible medical images aligned with simulated patient symptoms, enabling diverse diagnostic skill training. Specifically, MedDiT integrates various patient Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which describe the attributes and symptoms of patients, to dynamically prompt Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior and control the patient characteristics, mitigating hallucination during medical conversation. Additionally, a well-tuned Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model is incorporated to generate medical images according to the specified patient attributes in the KG. In this paper, we present the capabilities of MedDiT through a practical demonstration, showcasing its ability to act in diverse simulated patient cases and generate the corresponding medical images. This can provide an abundant and interactive learning experience for students, advancing medical education by offering an immersive simulation platform for future healthcare professionals. The work sheds light on the feasibility of incorporating advanced technologies like LLM, KG, and DiT in education applications, highlighting their potential to address the challenges faced in simulated patient-based medical education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichu Xu, Xin-Chun Li, Le Gan, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Merging models becomes a fundamental procedure in some applications that consider model efficiency and robustness. The training randomness or Non-I.I.D. data poses a huge challenge for averaging-based model fusion. Previous research efforts focus on element-wise regularization or neural permutations to enhance model averaging while overlooking weight scope variations among models, which can significantly affect merging effectiveness. In this paper, we reveal variations in weight scope under different training conditions, shedding light on its influence on model merging. Fortunately, the parameters in each layer basically follow the Gaussian distribution, which inspires a novel and simple regularization approach named Weight Scope Alignment (WSA). It contains two key components: 1) leveraging a target weight scope to guide the model training process for ensuring weight scope matching in the subsequent model merging. 2) fusing the weight scope of two or more models into a unified one for multi-stage model fusion. We extend the WSA regularization to two different scenarios, including Mode Connectivity and Federated Learning. Abundant experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenglin Zhang, Pengtian Zhu, Minghua Ma, Jiagang Wang, Yongqian Sun, Dongwen Li, Jingyu Wang, Qianying Guo, Xiaolei Hua, Lin Zhu, Dan Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general question-answering (Q&A) but often fall short in specialized domains due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge. Commercial companies face the dual challenges of privacy protection and resource constraints when involving LLMs for fine-tuning. This paper propose a novel framework, Self-Evolution, designed to address these issues by leveraging lightweight open-source LLMs through multiple iterative fine-tuning rounds. To enhance the efficiency of iterative fine-tuning, Self-Evolution employ a strategy that filters and reinforces the knowledge with higher value during the iterative process. We employed Self-Evolution on Qwen1.5-7B-Chat using 4,000 documents containing rich domain knowledge from China Mobile, achieving a performance score 174% higher on domain-specific question-answering evaluations than Qwen1.5-7B-Chat and even 22% higher than Qwen1.5-72B-Chat. Self-Evolution has been deployed in China Mobile's daily operation and maintenance for 117 days, and it improves the efficiency of locating alarms, fixing problems, and finding related reports, with an average efficiency improvement of over 18.6%. In addition, we release Self-Evolution framework code in https://github.com/Zero-Pointer/Self-Evolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Torben Swoboda, Lode Lauwaert</p>
<p>Abstract: The neutrality thesis holds that technology cannot be laden with values. This long-standing view has faced critiques, but much of the argumentation against neutrality has focused on traditional, non-smart technologies like bridges and razors. In contrast, AI is a smart technology increasingly used in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and policing, where its decisions can cause moral harm. In this paper, we argue that artificial intelligence, particularly artificial agents that autonomously make decisions to pursue their goals, challenge the neutrality thesis. Our central claim is that the computational models underlying artificial agents can integrate representations of moral values such as fairness, honesty and avoiding harm. We provide a conceptual framework discussing the neutrality thesis, values, and AI. Moreover, we examine two approaches to designing computational models of morality, artificial conscience and ethical prompting, and present empirical evidence from text-based game environments that artificial agents with such models exhibit more ethical behavior compared to agents without these models. The findings support that AI can embody moral values, which contradicts the claim that all technologies are necessarily value-neutral.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ora Nova Fandina, Leshem Choshen, Eitan Farchi, George Kour, Yotam Perlitz, Orna Raz</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider a scenario where a harmfulness detection metric is employed by a system to filter unsafe responses generated by a Large Language Model. When analyzing individual harmful and unethical prompt-response pairs, the metric correctly classifies each pair as highly unsafe, assigning the highest score. However, when these same prompts and responses are concatenated, the metric's decision flips, assigning the lowest possible score, thereby misclassifying the content as safe and allowing it to bypass the filter. In this study, we discovered that several harmfulness LLM-based metrics, including GPT-based, exhibit this decision-flipping phenomenon. Additionally, we found that even an advanced metric like GPT-4o is highly sensitive to input order. Specifically, it tends to classify responses as safe if the safe content appears first, regardless of any harmful content that follows, and vice versa. This work introduces automatic concatenation-based tests to assess the fundamental properties a valid metric should satisfy. We applied these tests in a model safety scenario to assess the reliability of harmfulness detection metrics, uncovering a number of inconsistencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghwa Kang, Youngmoon Lee, Eun-Kyu Lee, Brent Kang, Jinkyu Lee, Hyeongboo Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: In the training and inference of spiking neural networks (SNNs), direct training and lightweight computation methods have been orthogonally developed, aimed at reducing power consumption. However, only a limited number of approaches have applied these two mechanisms simultaneously and failed to fully leverage the advantages of SNN-based vision transformers (ViTs) since they were originally designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose AT-SNN designed to dynamically adjust the number of tokens processed during inference in SNN-based ViTs with direct training, wherein power consumption is proportional to the number of tokens. We first demonstrate the applicability of adaptive computation time (ACT), previously limited to RNNs and ViTs, to SNN-based ViTs, enhancing it to discard less informative spatial tokens selectively. Also, we propose a new token-merge mechanism that relies on the similarity of tokens, which further reduces the number of tokens while enhancing accuracy. We implement AT-SNN to Spikformer and show the effectiveness of AT-SNN in achieving high energy efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the image classification tasks, CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. For example, our approach uses up to 42.4% fewer tokens than the existing best-performing method on CIFAR-100, while conserving higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Hu, Shaowei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) motivates promising studies of computing optimal Interpretable Machine Learning models, especially decision trees. Such models generally provide optimality in compact size or empirical accuracy. Recent works focus on improving efficiency due to the natural scalability issue. The application of such models to practical problems is quite limited. As an emerging problem in circuit design, Approximate Logic Synthesis (ALS) aims to reduce circuit complexity by sacrificing correctness. Recently, multiple heuristic machine learning methods have been applied in ALS, which learns approximated circuits from samples of input-output pairs.
  In this paper, we propose a new ALS methodology realizing the approximation via learning optimal decision trees in empirical accuracy. Compared to previous heuristic ALS methods, the guarantee of optimality achieves a more controllable trade-off between circuit complexity and accuracy. Experimental results show clear improvements in our methodology in the quality of approximated designs (circuit complexity and accuracy) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this tutorial, we present a compact and holistic discussion of Deep Learning with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and supervised regression. While there are numerous books and articles on the individual topics we cover, comprehensive and detailed tutorials that address Deep Learning from a foundational yet rigorous and accessible perspective are rare. Most resources on CNNs are either too advanced, focusing on cutting-edge architectures, or too narrow, addressing only specific applications like image classification.This tutorial not only summarizes the most relevant concepts but also provides an in-depth exploration of each, offering a complete yet agile set of ideas. Moreover, we highlight the powerful synergy between learning theory, statistic, and machine learning, which together underpin the Deep Learning and CNN frameworks. We aim for this tutorial to serve as an optimal resource for students, professors, and anyone interested in understanding the foundations of Deep Learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Taeyoon Kwon, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Guiding large language models with a selected set of human-authored demonstrations is a common practice for improving LLM applications. However, human effort can be costly, especially in specialized domains (e.g., clinical diagnosis), and does not guarantee optimal performance due to the potential discrepancy of target skills between selected demonstrations and real test instances. Motivated by these, this paper explores the automatic creation of customized demonstrations, whose target skills align with the given target instance. We present SELF-TAUGHT, a problem-solving framework, which facilitates demonstrations that are "tailored" to the target problem and "filtered" for better quality (i.e., correctness) in a zero-shot manner. In 15 tasks of multiple-choice questions of diverse domains and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with real-world patients, SELF-TAUGHT achieves superior performance to strong baselines (e.g., Few-shot CoT, Plan-and-Solve, Auto-CoT). We conduct comprehensive analyses on SELF-TAUGHT, including its generalizability to existing prompting methods and different LLMs, the quality of its intermediate generation, and more.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitris Stripelis, Zijian Hu, Jipeng Zhang, Zhaozhuo Xu, Alay Shah, Han Jin, Yuhang Yao, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, numerous new LLMs have emerged, each possessing domain-specific expertise. This proliferation has highlighted the need for quick, high-quality, and cost-effective LLM query response methods. Yet, no single LLM exists to efficiently balance this trilemma. Some models are powerful but extremely costly, while others are fast and inexpensive but qualitatively inferior. To address this challenge, we present PolyRouter, a non-monolithic LLM querying system that seamlessly integrates various LLM experts into a single query interface and dynamically routes incoming queries to the most high-performant expert based on query's requirements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that when compared to standalone expert models, PolyRouter improves query efficiency by up to 40%, and leads to significant cost reductions of up to 30%, while maintaining or enhancing model performance by up to 10%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Zhu, Shengchang Li, Ziqian Kong, Peilan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Trustworthiness reasoning is crucial in multiplayer games with incomplete information, enabling agents to identify potential allies and adversaries, thereby enhancing reasoning and decision-making processes. Traditional approaches relying on pre-trained models necessitate extensive domain-specific data and considerable reward feedback, with their lack of real-time adaptability hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments. In this paper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework, leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster trustworthiness reasoning in agents. GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness graph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves relevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer game "Werewolf," comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with Native RAG and Rerank RAG. Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the baseline methods by over 30\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning performance. Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as identity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process more transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratyush Kumar, Kuber Vijaykumar Bellad, Bharat Vadlamudi, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), a major use case that has emerged is querying databases in plain English, translating user questions into executable database queries, which has improved significantly. However, real-world datasets often feature a vast array of attributes and complex values, complicating the LLMs task of accurately identifying relevant columns or values from natural language queries. Traditional methods cannot fully relay the datasets size and complexity to the LLM. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages Full-Text Search (FTS) on the input table. This approach not only enables precise detection of specific values and columns but also narrows the search space for language models, thereby enhancing query accuracy. Additionally, it supports a custom auto-complete feature that suggests queries based on the data in the table. This integration significantly refines the interaction between the user and complex datasets, offering a sophisticated solution to the limitations faced by current table querying capabilities. This work is accompanied by an application for both Mac and Windows platforms, which readers can try out themselves on their own data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12420">Dataset | Mindset = Explainable AI | Interpretable AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Caesar Wu, Rajkumar Buyya, Yuan Fang Li, Pascal Bouvry</p>
<p>Abstract: We often use "explainable" Artificial Intelligence (XAI)" and "interpretable AI (IAI)" interchangeably when we apply various XAI tools for a given dataset to explain the reasons that underpin machine learning (ML) outputs. However, these notions can sometimes be confusing because interpretation often has a subjective connotation, while explanations lean towards objective facts. We argue that XAI is a subset of IAI. The concept of IAI is beyond the sphere of a dataset. It includes the domain of a mindset. At the core of this ambiguity is the duality of reasons, in which we can reason either outwards or inwards. When directed outwards, we want the reasons to make sense through the laws of nature. When turned inwards, we want the reasons to be happy, guided by the laws of the heart. While XAI and IAI share reason as the common notion for the goal of transparency, clarity, fairness, reliability, and accountability in the context of ethical AI and trustworthy AI (TAI), their differences lie in that XAI emphasizes the post-hoc analysis of a dataset, and IAI requires a priori mindset of abstraction. This hypothesis can be proved by empirical experiments based on an open dataset and harnessed by High-Performance Computing (HPC). The demarcation of XAI and IAI is indispensable because it would be impossible to determine regulatory policies for many AI applications, especially in healthcare, human resources, banking, and finance. We aim to clarify these notions and lay the foundation of XAI, IAI, EAI, and TAI for many practitioners and policymakers in future AI applications and research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Soft-tissue and bone tumours (STBT) are rare, diagnostically challenging lesions with variable clinical behaviours and treatment approaches. This systematic review provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using radiological imaging for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumours, highlighting challenges in clinical translation, and evaluating study alignment with the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) and the FUTURE-AI international consensus guidelines for trustworthy and deployable AI to promote the clinical translation of AI methods. The review covered literature from several bibliographic databases, including papers published before 17/07/2024. Original research in peer-reviewed journals focused on radiology-based AI for diagnosing or prognosing primary STBT was included. Exclusion criteria were animal, cadaveric, or laboratory studies, and non-English papers. Abstracts were screened by two of three independent reviewers for eligibility. Eligible papers were assessed against guidelines by one of three independent reviewers. The search identified 15,015 abstracts, from which 325 articles were included for evaluation. Most studies performed moderately on CLAIM, averaging a score of 28.9$\pm$7.5 out of 53, but poorly on FUTURE-AI, averaging 5.1$\pm$2.1 out of 30. Imaging-AI tools for STBT remain at the proof-of-concept stage, indicating significant room for improvement. Future efforts by AI developers should focus on design (e.g. define unmet clinical need, intended clinical setting and how AI would be integrated in clinical workflow), development (e.g. build on previous work, explainability), evaluation (e.g. evaluating and addressing biases, evaluating AI against best practices), and data reproducibility and availability (making documented code and data publicly available). Following these recommendations could improve clinical translation of AI methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wei, Jianing Qiu, Haibao Yu, Wu Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have had a significant impact on diverse research domains, including medicine and healthcare. However, the potential of LLMs as copilots in medical education remains underexplored. Current AI-assisted educational tools are limited by their solitary learning approach and inability to simulate the multi-disciplinary and interactive nature of actual medical training. To address these limitations, we propose MEDCO (Medical EDucation COpilots), a novel multi-agent-based copilot system specially developed to emulate real-world medical training environments. MEDCO incorporates three primary agents: an agentic patient, an expert doctor, and a radiologist, facilitating a multi-modal and interactive learning environment. Our framework emphasizes the learning of proficient question-asking skills, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and peer discussions between students. Our experiments show that simulated virtual students who underwent training with MEDCO not only achieved substantial performance enhancements comparable to those of advanced models, but also demonstrated human-like learning behaviors and improvements, coupled with an increase in the number of learning samples. This work contributes to medical education by introducing a copilot that implements an interactive and collaborative learning approach. It also provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of AI-integrated training paradigms.</p>

<p>Abstract: To solve ever more complex problems, Deep Neural Networks are scaled to billions of parameters, leading to huge computational costs. An effective approach to reduce computational requirements and increase efficiency is to prune unnecessary components of these often over-parameterized networks. Previous work has shown that attribution methods from the field of eXplainable AI serve as effective means to extract and prune the least relevant network components in a few-shot fashion. We extend the current state by proposing to explicitly optimize hyperparameters of attribution methods for the task of pruning, and further include transformer-based networks in our analysis. Our approach yields higher model compression rates of large transformer- and convolutional architectures (VGG, ResNet, ViT) compared to previous works, while still attaining high performance on ImageNet classification tasks. Here, our experiments indicate that transformers have a higher degree of over-parameterization compared to convolutional neural networks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haojun Shi, Suyu Ye, Xinyu Fang, Chuanyang Jin, Layla Isik, Yen-Ling Kuo, Tianmin Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding people's social interactions in complex real-world scenarios often relies on intricate mental reasoning. To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. MuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning). Our experimental results show that LIMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including large multi-modal models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro) and a recent multi-modal ToM model, BIP-ALM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akihiro Takemura, Katsumi Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new method for integrating neural networks with logic programming in Neural-Symbolic AI (NeSy), aimed at learning with distant supervision, in which direct labels are unavailable. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not depend on symbolic solvers for reasoning about missing labels. Instead, it evaluates logical implications and constraints in a differentiable manner by embedding both neural network outputs and logic programs into matrices. This method facilitates more efficient learning under distant supervision. We evaluated our approach against existing methods while maintaining a constant volume of training data. The findings indicate that our method not only matches or exceeds the accuracy of other methods across various tasks but also speeds up the learning process. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enhance both accuracy and learning efficiency in NeSy applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Shahriar Lotfi, Ayaz Isazadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite all the progress in Web service selection, the need for an approach with a better optimality and performance still remains. This paper presents a genetic algorithm by adopting the Pareto principle that is called GAP2WSS for selecting a Web service for each task of a composite Web service from a pool of candidate Web services. In contrast to the existing approaches, all global QoS constraints, interservice constraints, and transactional constraints are considered simultaneously. At first, all candidate Web services are scored and ranked per each task using the proposed mechanism. Then, the top 20 percent of the candidate Web services of each task are considered as the candidate Web services of the corresponding task to reduce the problem search space. Finally, the Web service selection problem is solved by focusing only on these 20 percent candidate Web services of each task using a genetic algorithm. Empirical studies demonstrate this approach leads to a higher efficiency and efficacy as compared with the case that all the candidate Web services are considered in solving the problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Diego Elias Costa, Rabe Abdalkareem, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: Pull-based development has enabled numerous volunteers to contribute to open-source projects with fewer barriers. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of pull requests (PRs) with valid contributions are abandoned by their contributors, wasting the effort and time put in by both the contributors and maintainers. To better understand the underlying dynamics of contributor-abandoned PRs, we conduct a mixed-methods study using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We curate a dataset consisting of 265,325 PRs including 4,450 abandoned ones from ten popular and mature GitHub projects and measure 16 features characterizing PRs, contributors, review processes, and projects. Using statistical and machine learning techniques, we find that complex PRs, novice contributors, and lengthy reviews have a higher probability of abandonment and the rate of PR abandonment fluctuates alongside the projects' maturity or workload. To identify why contributors abandon their PRs, we also manually examine a random sample of 354 abandoned PRs. We observe that the most frequent abandonment reasons are related to the obstacles faced by contributors, followed by the hurdles imposed by maintainers during the review process. Finally, we survey the top core maintainers of the studied projects to understand their perspectives on dealing with PR abandonment and on our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Diego Elias Costa, Suhaib Mujahid, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: Pull Requests (PRs) that are neither progressed nor resolved clutter the list of PRs, making it difficult for the maintainers to manage and prioritize unresolved PRs. To automatically track, follow up, and close such inactive PRs, Stale bot was introduced by GitHub. Despite its increasing adoption, there are ongoing debates on whether using Stale bot alleviates or exacerbates the problem of inactive PRs. To better understand if and how Stale bot helps projects in their pull-based development workflow, we perform an empirical study of 20 large and popular open-source projects. We find that Stale bot can help deal with a backlog of unresolved PRs as the projects closed more PRs within the first few months of adoption. Moreover, Stale bot can help improve the efficiency of the PR review process as the projects reviewed PRs that ended up merged and resolved PRs that ended up closed faster after the adoption. However, Stale bot can also negatively affect the contributors as the projects experienced a considerable decrease in their number of active contributors after the adoption. Therefore, relying solely on Stale bot to deal with inactive PRs may lead to decreased community engagement and an increased probability of contributor abandonment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Ahmad Abdellatif, Diego Elias Costa, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of a Pull Request (PR) depends on the responsiveness of the maintainers and the contributor during the review process. Being aware of the expected waiting times can lead to better interactions and managed expectations for both the maintainers and the contributor. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning approach to predict the first response latency of the maintainers following the submission of a PR, and the first response latency of the contributor after receiving the first response from the maintainers. We curate a dataset of 20 large and popular open-source projects on GitHub and extract 21 features to characterize projects, contributors, PRs, and review processes. Using these features, we then evaluate seven types of classifiers to identify the best-performing models. We also conduct permutation feature importance and SHAP analyses to understand the importance and the impact of different features on the predicted response latencies. We find that our CatBoost models are the most effective for predicting the first response latencies of both maintainers and contributors. We also observe that PRs submitted earlier in the week, containing an average number of commits, and with concise descriptions are more likely to receive faster first responses from the maintainers. Similarly, PRs with a lower first response latency from maintainers, that received the first response of maintainers earlier in the week, and containing an average number of commits tend to receive faster first responses from the contributors. Additionally, contributors with a higher acceptance rate and a history of timely responses in the project are likely to both obtain and provide faster first responses. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of our approach in a cross-project setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Musfiqur Rahman, SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Ahmad Abdellatif, Haya Samaana, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: [Context] Nowadays, many software systems include Artificial Intelligence (AI) components and changes in the development environment have been known to induce variability in an AI-based system. [Objective] However, how an environment configuration impacts the variability of these systems is yet to be explored. Understanding and quantifying the degree of variability due to such configurations can help practitioners decide the best environment configuration for the most stable AI products. [Method] To achieve this goal, we performed experiments with eight different combinations of three key environment variables (operating system, Python version, and CPU architecture) on 30 open-source AI-based systems using the Travis CI platform. We evaluate variability using three metrics: the output of an AI component like an ML model (performance), the time required to build and run a system (processing time), and the cost associated with building and running a system (expense). [Results] Our results indicate that variability exists in all three metrics; however, it is observed more frequently with respect to processing time and expense than performance. For example, between Linux and MacOS, variabilities are observed in 23%, 96.67%, and 100% of the studied projects in performance, processing time, and expense, respectively. [Conclusion] Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the optimal combination of configuration settings to mitigate performance drops and reduce retraining time and cost before deploying an AI-based system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasmine Latendresse, SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Ahmad Abdellatif, Emad Shihab</p>
<p>Abstract: Software libraries play a critical role in the functionality, efficiency, and maintainability of software systems. As developers increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline their coding processes, the effectiveness of these models in recommending appropriate libraries becomes crucial yet remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a software librarian and identify areas for improvement. We conducted an empirical study using GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate Python code for 10,000 Stack Overflow questions. Our findings show that ChatGPT uses third-party libraries nearly 10% more often than human developers, favoring widely adopted and well-established options. However, 14.2% of the recommended libraries had restrictive copyleft licenses, which were not explicitly communicated by ChatGPT. Additionally, 6.5% of the libraries did not work out of the box, leading to potential developer confusion and wasted time. While ChatGPT can be an effective software librarian, it should be improved by providing more explicit information on maintainability metrics and licensing. We recommend that developers implement rigorous dependency management practices and double-check library licenses before integrating LLM-generated code into their projects.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has underscored the urgent need for responsible AI practices. Despite increasing interest, a comprehensive AI risk assessment toolkit remains lacking. This study introduces our Responsible AI (RAI) Question Bank, a comprehensive framework and tool designed to support diverse AI initiatives. By integrating AI ethics principles such as fairness, transparency, and accountability into a structured question format, the RAI Question Bank aids in identifying potential risks, aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act, and enhancing overall AI governance. A key benefit of the RAI Question Bank is its systematic approach to linking lower-level risk questions to higher-level ones and related themes, preventing siloed assessments and ensuring a cohesive evaluation process. Case studies illustrate the practical application of the RAI Question Bank in assessing AI projects, from evaluating risk factors to informing decision-making processes. The study also demonstrates how the RAI Question Bank can be used to ensure compliance with standards, mitigate risks, and promote the development of trustworthy AI systems. This work advances RAI by providing organizations with a valuable tool to navigate the complexities of ethical AI development and deployment while ensuring comprehensive risk management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qin, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of neuromorphic computing has gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to bridge the gap between the efficiency of biological neural networks and the performance of artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates a spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust temporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven nature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous, time-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's selective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model complex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike employs biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and synaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other hand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process relevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets, including DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential MNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency. Moreover, the model exhibits robustness to various input perturbations and noise levels, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: With the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), LLM-driven visual agents are increasingly impacting software interfaces, particularly those with graphical user interfaces. This work introduces a novel LLM-based multimodal agent framework for mobile devices. This framework, capable of navigating mobile devices, emulates human-like interactions. Our agent constructs a flexible action space that enhances adaptability across various applications including parser, text and vision descriptions. The agent operates through two main phases: exploration and deployment. During the exploration phase, functionalities of user interface elements are documented either through agent-driven or manual explorations into a customized structured knowledge base. In the deployment phase, RAG technology enables efficient retrieval and update from this knowledge base, thereby empowering the agent to perform tasks effectively and accurately. This includes performing complex, multi-step operations across various applications, thereby demonstrating the framework's adaptability and precision in handling customized task workflows. Our experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the framework's superior performance, confirming its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our code will be open source soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly acknowledged as a vital component for the advancement and competitiveness of modern organizations, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, the adoption of AI technologies in SMEs faces significant barriers, primarily related to cost, lack of technical skills, and employee acceptance. This study proposes a comprehensive, phased framework designed to facilitate the effective adoption of AI in SMEs by systematically addressing these barriers. The framework begins with raising awareness and securing commitment from leadership, followed by the adoption of low-cost, general-purpose AI tools to build technical competence and foster a positive attitude towards AI. As familiarity with AI technologies increases, the framework advocates for the integration of task-specific AI tools to enhance efficiency and productivity. Subsequently, it guides organizations towards the in-house development of generative AI tools, providing greater customization and control. Finally, the framework addresses the development of discriminative AI models to meet highly specific and precision-oriented tasks. By providing a structured and incremental approach, this framework ensures that SMEs can navigate the complexities of AI integration effectively, driving innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage. This study contributes to the field by offering a practical, prescriptive framework tailored to the unique needs of SMEs, facilitating the successful adoption of AI technologies and positioning these organizations for sustained growth in a competitive landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the technical details and periodic findings of our project, CareerAgent, which aims to build a generative simulation framework for a Holacracy organization using Large Language Model-based Autonomous Agents. Specifically, the simulation framework includes three phases: construction, execution, and evaluation, and it incorporates basic characteristics of individuals, organizations, tasks, and meetings. Through our simulation, we obtained several interesting findings. At the organizational level, an increase in the average values of management competence and functional competence can reduce overall members' stress levels, but it negatively impacts deeper organizational performance measures such as average task completion. At the individual level, both competences can improve members' work performance. From the analysis of social networks, we found that highly competent members selectively participate in certain tasks and take on more responsibilities. Over time, small sub-communities form around these highly competent members within the holacracy. These findings contribute theoretically to the study of organizational science and provide practical insights for managers to understand the organization dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Mansoor Kamoona, Hui Song, Mahdi Jalili, Hao Wang, Reza Razzaghi, Xinghuo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing popularity of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses unique challenges for grid operators and infrastructure, which requires effectively managing these vehicles' integration into the grid. Identification of EVs charging is essential to electricity Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) for better planning and managing the distribution grid. One critical aspect is the ability to accurately identify the presence of EV charging in the grid. EV charging identification using smart meter readings obtained from behind-the-meter devices is a challenging task that enables effective managing the integration of EVs into the existing power grid. Different from the existing supervised models that require addressing the imbalance problem caused by EVs and non-EVs data, we propose a novel unsupervised memory-based transformer (M-TR) that can run in real-time (online) to detect EVs charging from a streaming smart meter. It dynamically leverages coarse-scale historical information using an M-TR encoder from an extended global temporal window, in conjunction with an M-TR decoder that concentrates on a limited time frame, local window, aiming to capture the fine-scale characteristics of the smart meter data. The M-TR is based on an anomaly detection technique that does not require any prior knowledge about EVs charging profiles, nor it does only require real power consumption data of non-EV users. In addition, the proposed model leverages the power of transfer learning. The M-TR is compared with different state-of-the-art methods and performs better than other unsupervised learning models. The model can run with an excellent execution time of 1.2 sec. for 1-minute smart recordings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increased use of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of real-world applications calls for automatic tools to check the factual accuracy of their outputs, as LLMs often hallucinate. This is difficult as it requires assessing the factuality of free-form open-domain responses. While there has been a lot of research on this topic, different papers use different evaluation benchmarks and measures, which makes them hard to compare and hampers future progress. To mitigate these issues, we developed OpenFactCheck, a unified framework, with three modules: (i) RESPONSEEVAL, which allows users to easily customize an automatic fact-checking system and to assess the factuality of all claims in an input document using that system, (ii) LLMEVAL, which assesses the overall factuality of an LLM, and (iii) CHECKEREVAL, a module to evaluate automatic fact-checking systems. OpenFactCheck is open-sourced (https://github.com/hasaniqbal777/openfactcheck) and publicly released as a Python library (https://pypi.org/project/openfactcheck/) and also as a web service (https://huggingface.co/spaces/hasaniqbal777/OpenFactCheck).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianshu Zheng, Zican Wang, Timothy Bray, Daniel C. Alexander, Dan Wu, Hui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is increasingly investigated for use in a variety of clinical tasks from diagnosis, through staging, to treatment monitoring. However, experiment design in qMRI, the identification of the optimal acquisition protocols, has been focused on obtaining the most precise parameter estimations, with no regard for the specific requirements of downstream tasks. Here we propose SCREENER: A general framework for task-specific experiment design in quantitative MRI. SCREENER incorporates a task-specific objective and seeks the optimal protocol with a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) based optimization strategy. To illustrate this framework, we employ a task of classifying the inflammation status of bone marrow using diffusion MRI data with intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) modelling. Results demonstrate SCREENER outperforms previous ad hoc and optimized protocols under clinical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, achieving significant improvement, both in binary classification tasks, e.g. from 67% to 89%, and in a multi-class classification task, from 46% to 59%. Additionally, we show this improvement is robust to the SNR. Lastly, we demonstrate the advantage of DRL-based optimization strategy, enabling zero-shot discovery of near-optimal protocols for a range of SNRs not used in training. In conclusion, SCREENER has the potential to enable wider uptake of qMRI in the clinic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent global estimates suggest that as many as 2.41 billion individuals have health conditions that would benefit from rehabilitation services. Home-based Physical Therapy (PT) faces significant challenges in providing interactive feedback and meaningful observation for therapists and patients. To fill this gap, we present MicroXercise, which integrates micro-motion analysis with wearable sensors, providing therapists and patients with a comprehensive feedback interface, including video, text, and scores. Crucially, it employs multi-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and attribution-based explainable methods to analyze the existing deep learning neural networks in monitoring exercises, focusing on a high granularity of exercise. This synergistic approach is pivotal, providing output matching the input size to precisely highlight critical subtleties and movements in PT, thus transforming complex AI analysis into clear, actionable feedback. By highlighting these micro-motions in different metrics, such as stability and range of motion, MicroXercise significantly enhances the understanding and relevance of feedback for end-users. Comparative performance metrics underscore its effectiveness over traditional methods, such as a 39% and 42% improvement in Feature Mutual Information (FMI) and Continuity. MicroXercise is a step ahead in home-based physical therapy, providing a technologically advanced and intuitively helpful solution to enhance patient care and outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongye Zheng, Bingxing Wang, Minheng Xiao, Honglin Qin, Zhizhong Wu, Lianghao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive optimizers are pivotal in guiding the weight updates of deep neural networks, yet they often face challenges such as poor generalization and oscillation issues. To counter these, we introduce sigSignGrad and tanhSignGrad, two novel optimizers that integrate adaptive friction coefficients based on the Sigmoid and Tanh functions, respectively. These algorithms leverage short-term gradient information, a feature overlooked in traditional Adam variants like diffGrad and AngularGrad, to enhance parameter updates and convergence.Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the wide-ranging adjustment capability of the friction coefficient S, which aligns with targeted parameter update strategies and outperforms existing methods in both optimization trajectory smoothness and convergence rate.

<p>Abstract: AI assistants are being increasingly used by students enrolled in higher education institutions. While these tools provide opportunities for improved teaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment and learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of vulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes to be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential scale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can complete assessment questions in standard university-level STEM courses. Specifically, we compile a novel dataset of textual assessment questions from 50 courses at EPFL and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to produce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions correctly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one prompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset by degree program, these systems already pass non-project assessments of large numbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher education accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve. Our results call for revising program-level assessment design in higher education in light of advances in generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Chen, Yichen Li, Jianfei Yang, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating fair and accurate predictions plays a pivotal role in deploying large language models (LLMs) in the real world. However, existing debiasing methods inevitably generate unfair or incorrect predictions as they are designed and evaluated to achieve parity across different social groups but leave aside individual commonsense facts, resulting in modified knowledge that elicits unreasonable or undesired predictions. In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation benchmark, BiaScope, which systematically assesses performance by leveraging newly constructed datasets and metrics on knowledge retention and generalization. Then, we propose a novel debiasing approach, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables fine-grained calibration of individual social biases. FAST identifies the decisive layer responsible for storing social biases and then calibrates its outputs by integrating a small modular network, considering both bias mitigation and knowledge-preserving demands. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with superior debiasing performance while not compromising the overall model capability for knowledge retention and downstream predictions. This highlights the potential of fine-grained debiasing strategies to achieve fairness in LLMs. Code will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the field of radiology has increasingly harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline workflows, and improve patient care. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as particularly promising tools, offering significant potential in assisting radiologists with report generation, clinical decision support, and patient communication. This paper presents an advanced radiology-focused large language model: MGH Radiology Llama. It is developed using the Llama 3 70B model, building upon previous domain-specific models like Radiology-GPT and Radiology-Llama2. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital, comprising over 6.5 million de-identified medical reports across various imaging modalities, the model demonstrates significant improvements in generating accurate and clinically relevant radiology impressions given the corresponding findings. Our evaluation, incorporating both traditional metrics and a GPT-4-based assessment, highlights the enhanced performance of this work over general-purpose LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghao Aaron Li, Xilin Jiang, Jordan Darefsky, Ge Zhu, Nima Mesgarani</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of text-based chatbots, demonstrating their capability to engage in coherent and contextually relevant dialogues. However, extending these advancements to enable end-to-end speech-to-speech conversation bots remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the extensive dataset and computational resources required. The conventional approach of cascading automatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM, and text-to-speech (TTS) models in a pipeline, while effective, suffers from unnatural prosody because it lacks direct interactions between the input audio and its transcribed text and the output audio. These systems are also limited by their inherent latency from the ASR process for real-time applications. This paper introduces Style-Talker, an innovative framework that fine-tunes an audio LLM alongside a style-based TTS model for fast spoken dialog generation. Style-Talker takes user input audio and uses transcribed chat history and speech styles to generate both the speaking style and text for the response. Subsequently, the TTS model synthesizes the speech, which is then played back to the user. While the response speech is being played, the input speech undergoes ASR processing to extract the transcription and speaking style, serving as the context for the ensuing dialogue turn. This novel pipeline accelerates the traditional cascade ASR-LLM-TTS systems while integrating rich paralinguistic information from input speech. Our experimental results show that Style-Talker significantly outperforms the conventional cascade and speech-to-speech baselines in terms of both dialogue naturalness and coherence while being more than 50% faster.</p>

Our empirical comparison demonstrates that the mixture model approach is more robust to retrieval noise in in-context learning, providing a more reliable estimation of data contributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has advanced data representation and analysis, bringing significant progress in their use for medical questions and answering. Despite these advancements, integrating tabular data, especially numerical data pivotal in clinical contexts, into LLM paradigms has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of vector representations from last hidden states of LLMs for medical diagnostics and prognostics using electronic health record (EHR) data. We compare the performance of these embeddings with that of raw numerical EHR data when used as feature inputs to traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms that excel at tabular data learning, such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting. We focus on instruction-tuned LLMs in a zero-shot setting to represent abnormal physiological data and evaluating their utilities as feature extractors to enhance ML classifiers for predicting diagnoses, length of stay, and mortality. Furthermore, we examine prompt engineering techniques on zero-shot and few-shot LLM embeddings to measure their impact comprehensively. Although findings suggest the raw data features still prevails in medical ML tasks, zero-shot LLM embeddings demonstrate competitive results, suggesting a promising avenue for future research in medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyu Zhao, Menghang Dong, Rongyu Zhang, Wenzhao Zheng, Yunpeng Zhang, Huanrui Yang, Dalong Du, Kurt Keutzer, Shanghang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in storing diverse linguistic and factual knowledge. Conventional methods frequently face challenges due to knowledge confusion stemming from their monolithic and redundant architectures, which calls for more efficient solutions with minimal computational overhead, particularly for LLMs. In this paper, we explore the FFN computation paradigm in LLMs and introduce FactorLLM, a novel approach that decomposes well-trained dense FFNs into sparse sub-networks without requiring any further modifications, while maintaining the same level of performance. Furthermore, we embed a router from the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), combined with our devised Prior-Approximate (PA) loss term that facilitates the dynamic activation of experts and knowledge adaptation, thereby accelerating computational processes and enhancing performance using minimal training data and fine-tuning steps. FactorLLM thus enables efficient knowledge factorization and activates select groups of experts specifically tailored to designated tasks, emulating the interactive functional segmentation of the human brain. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FactorLLM which achieves comparable performance to the source model securing up to 85% model performance while obtaining over a 30% increase in inference speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongcheng Ding, Xuanze Zhao, Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Deshinta Arrova Dewi, Zixiao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as business intelligence and financial forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) have become a popular paradigm for sentiment analysis, leveraging multi-task learning to address specific tasks concurrently. However, LLMs with fine-tuning for sentiment analysis often underperforms due to the inherent challenges in managing diverse task complexities. Moreover, constant-weight approaches in multi-task learning struggle to adapt to variations in data characteristics, further complicating model effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework with a dynamic adaptive optimization (DAO) module. This module is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing an effective and flexible solution for multi-task learning. The key component of the DAO module is dynamic adaptive loss, which dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to different tasks based on their relative importance and data characteristics during training. Sentiment analyses on a standard and customized financial text dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance. Specifically, this work improves the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Accuracy (ACC) by 15.58% and 1.24% respectively, compared with previous work.</p>

<p>Abstract: The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the healthcare industry has garnered considerable attention, attributable to its prospective enhancement of clinical outcomes, expansion of access to superior healthcare, cost reduction, and elevation of patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, the primary hurdle that persists is related to the quality of accessible multi-modal healthcare data in conjunction with the evolution of AI methodologies. This study delves into the adoption of large language models to address specific challenges, specifically, the standardization of healthcare data. We advocate the use of these models to identify and map clinical data schemas to established data standard attributes, such as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. Our results illustrate that employing large language models significantly diminishes the necessity for manual data curation and elevates the efficacy of the data standardization process. Consequently, the proposed methodology has the propensity to expedite the integration of AI in healthcare, ameliorate the quality of patient care, whilst minimizing the time and financial resources necessary for the preparation of data for AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to interpret the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Text generation in LLMs is modeled as a stochastic process where each step depends on previously generated content and model parameters, sampling the next word from a vocabulary distribution. We represent this generation process using SDE to capture both deterministic trends and stochastic perturbations. The drift term describes the deterministic trends in the generation process, while the diffusion term captures the stochastic variations. We fit these functions using neural networks and validate the model on real-world text corpora. Through numerical simulations and comprehensive analyses, including drift and diffusion analysis, stochastic process property evaluation, and phase space exploration, we provide deep insights into the dynamics of text generation. This approach not only enhances the understanding of the inner workings of LLMs but also offers a novel mathematical perspective on language generation, which is crucial for diagnosing, optimizing, and controlling the quality of generated text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sotiris Anagnostidis, Jannis Bulian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompts, including additional context provided therein. As LLMs grow in capability, understanding their prompt-sensitivity becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring reliable and robust performance, particularly since evaluating these models becomes more challenging. In this work, we investigate how current models (Llama, Mixtral, Falcon) respond when presented with additional input from another model, mimicking a scenario where a more capable model -- or a system with access to more external information -- provides supplementary information to the target model. Across a diverse spectrum of question-answering tasks, we study how an LLM's response to multiple-choice questions changes when the prompt includes a prediction and explanation from another model. Specifically, we explore the influence of the presence of an explanation, the stated authoritativeness of the source, and the stated confidence of the supplementary input. Our findings reveal that models are strongly influenced, and when explanations are provided they are swayed irrespective of the quality of the explanation. The models are more likely to be swayed if the input is presented as being authoritative or confident, but the effect is small in size. This study underscores the significant prompt-sensitivity of LLMs and highlights the potential risks of incorporating outputs from external sources without thorough scrutiny and further validation. As LLMs continue to advance, understanding and mitigating such sensitivities will be crucial for their reliable and trustworthy deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaang Li, Quan Wang, Zhongnan Wang, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require model editing to efficiently update specific knowledge within them and avoid factual errors. Most model editing methods are solely designed for single-time use and lead to a significant forgetting effect after sequential edits over time, referred to as lifelong editing. Current approaches manage sequential edits by freezing original parameters and allocating new adapters for each knowledge modification. However, these methods lack robustness to minor input variations. To address this challenge, we propose ELDER, \textbf{E}nhancing \textbf{L}ifelong mo\textbf{D}el \textbf{E}diting with mixtu\textbf{R}e of Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA). ELDER is an adaptive approach that integrates multiple LoRAs through a router network. It learns to create a continuous and smooth association between data and adapters, thereby enhancing robustness and generalization to semantically equivalent inputs. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss to help learn associations between adapter allocations and edit semantics. A deferral mechanism is also proposed to retain the original LLM capabilities post-edit. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA2-7B demonstrate that ELDER effectively edits models in the lifelong setting and exhibits strong scalability, while retaining LLM's general abilities on downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) necessitates complex reasoning by integrating multiple pieces of information to resolve intricate questions. However, existing QA systems encounter challenges such as outdated information, context window length limitations, and an accuracy-quantity trade-off. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, the Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation Model with Rethink (HiRAG), comprising Decomposer, Definer, Retriever, Filter, and Summarizer five key modules. We introduce a new hierarchical retrieval strategy that incorporates both sparse retrieval at the document level and dense retrieval at the chunk level, effectively integrating their strengths. Additionally, we propose a single-candidate retrieval method to mitigate the limitations of multi-candidate retrieval. We also construct two new corpora, Indexed Wikicorpus and Profile Wikicorpus, to address the issues of outdated and insufficient knowledge.
  Our experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that HiRAG outperforms state-of-the-art models across most metrics, and our Indexed Wikicorpus is effective. The code for HiRAG is available at https://github.com/2282588541a/HiRAG</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning enabled novel medical AI models, known as foundation models (FMs) that offer great potential for characterizing health from diverse biomedical data. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides rich, temporal data on glycemic patterns, but its full potential for predicting broader health outcomes remains underutilized. Here, we present GluFormer, a generative foundation model on biomedical temporal data based on a transformer architecture, and trained on over 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 non-diabetic individuals. We tokenized the CGM training data and trained GluFormer using next token prediction in a generative, autoregressive manner. We demonstrate that GluFormer generalizes effectively to 15 different external datasets, including 4936 individuals across 5 different geographical regions, 6 different CGM devices, and several metabolic disorders, including normoglycemic, prediabetic, and diabetic populations, as well as those with gestational diabetes and obesity. GluFormer produces embeddings which outperform traditional CGM analysis tools, and achieves high Pearson correlations in predicting clinical parameters such as HbA1c, liver-related parameters, blood lipids, and sleep-related indices. Notably, GluFormer can also predict onset of future health outcomes even 4 years in advance. We also show that CGM embeddings from pre-intervention periods in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) outperform other methods in predicting primary and secondary outcomes. When integrating dietary data into GluFormer, we show that the enhanced model can accurately generate CGM data based only on dietary intake data, simulate outcomes of dietary interventions, and predict individual responses to specific foods. Overall, we show that GluFormer accurately predicts health outcomes which generalize across different populations metabolic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Rafsan Kabir, Rafeed Mohammad Sultan, Ihsanul Haque Asif, Jawad Ibn Ahad, Fuad Rahman, Mohammad Ruhul Amin, Nabeel Mohammed, Shafin Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with a human reasoning approach ensures that LLMs produce morally correct and human-like decisions. Ethical concerns are raised because current models are prone to generating false positives and providing malicious responses. To contribute to this issue, we have curated an ethics dataset named Dataset for Aligning Reasons (DFAR), designed to aid in aligning language models to generate human-like reasons. The dataset comprises statements with ethical-unethical labels and their corresponding reasons. In this study, we employed a unique and novel fine-tuning approach that utilizes ethics labels and their corresponding reasons (L+R), in contrast to the existing fine-tuning approach that only uses labels (L). The original pre-trained versions, the existing fine-tuned versions, and our proposed fine-tuned versions of LLMs were then evaluated on an ethical-unethical classification task and a reason-generation task. Our proposed fine-tuning strategy notably outperforms the others in both tasks, achieving significantly higher accuracy scores in the classification task and lower misalignment rates in the reason-generation task. The increase in classification accuracies and decrease in misalignment rates indicate that the L+R fine-tuned models align more with human ethics. Hence, this study illustrates that injecting reasons has substantially improved the alignment of LLMs, resulting in more human-like responses. We have made the DFAR dataset and corresponding codes publicly available at https://github.com/apurba-nsu-rnd-lab/DFAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jane Castleman, Aleksandra Korolova</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Meta has shifted towards AI-mediated ad targeting mechanisms that do not require advertisers to provide detailed targeting criteria, likely driven by excitement over AI capabilities as well as new data privacy policies and targeting changes agreed upon in civil rights settlements. At the same time, Meta has touted their ad preference controls as an effective mechanism for users to control the ads they see. Furthermore, Meta markets their targeting explanations as a transparency tool that allows users to understand why they saw certain ads and inform actions to control future ads.
  Our study evaluates the effectiveness of Meta's "See less" ad control and the actionability of ad targeting explanations following the shift to AI-mediated targeting. We conduct a large-scale study, randomly assigning participants to mark "See less" to Body Weight Control or Parenting topics, and collecting the ads and targeting explanations Meta shows to participants before and after the intervention. We find that utilizing the "See less" ad control for the topics we study does not significantly reduce the number of ads shown by Meta on these topics, and that the control is less effective for some users whose demographics are correlated with the topic. Furthermore, we find that the majority of ad targeting explanations for local ads made no reference to location-specific targeting criteria, and did not inform users why ads related to the topics they marked to "See less" of continued to be delivered. We hypothesize that the poor effectiveness of controls and lack of actionability in explanations are the result of the shift to AI-mediated targeting, for which explainability and transparency tools have not yet been developed. Our work thus provides evidence for the need of new methods for transparency and user control, suitable and reflective of increasingly complex AI-mediated ad delivery systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Wei, Ziwei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Rule-based neural networks stand out for enabling interpretable classification by learning logical rules for both prediction and interpretation. However, existing models often lack flexibility due to the fixed model structure. Addressing this, we introduce the Normal Form Rule Learner (NFRL) algorithm, leveraging a selective discrete neural network, that treat weight parameters as hard selectors, to learn rules in both Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) for enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Instead of adopting a deep, complex structure, the NFRL incorporates two specialized Normal Form Layers (NFLs) with adaptable AND/OR neurons, a Negation Layer for input negations, and a Normal Form Constraint (NFC) to streamline neuron connections. We also show the novel network architecture can be optimized using adaptive gradient update together with Straight-Through Estimator to overcome the gradient vanishing challenge. Through extensive experiments on 11 datasets, NFRL demonstrates superior classification performance, quality of learned rules, efficiency and interpretability compared to 12 state-of-the-art alternatives.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Logan Cummins, Alexander Sommers, Sudip Mittal, Shahram Rahimi, Maria Seale, Joseph Jaboure, Thomas Arnold</p>
<p>Abstract: There exists three main areas of study inside of the field of predictive maintenance: anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and remaining useful life prediction. Notably, anomaly detection alerts the stakeholder that an anomaly is occurring. This raises two fundamental questions: what is causing the fault and how can we fix it? Inside of the field of explainable artificial intelligence, counterfactual explanations can give that information in the form of what changes to make to put the data point into the opposing class, in this case "healthy". The suggestions are not always actionable which may raise the interest in asking "what if we do this instead?" In this work, we provide a proof of concept for utilizing counterfactual explanations as what-if analysis. We perform this on the PRONOSTIA dataset with a temporal convolutional network as the anomaly detector. Our method presents the counterfactuals in the form of a what-if analysis for this base problem to inspire future work for more complex systems and scenarios.</p>

We implement IncX on top of D-RISE, a state-of-the-art black-box explainability tool for object detectors. We show that IncX's explanations are comparable in quality to those of D-RISE, with insertion curves being within 8%, and are computed two orders of magnitude faster that D-RISE's explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Innocenti, El Mehdi Achour, Ryan Singh, Christopher L. Buckley</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before weight updates. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is theoretically not well understood. Here, we study the geometry of the PC energy landscape at the (inference) equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated energy is simply a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Our theory is validated by experiments on both linear and non-linear networks. Based on these results, we conjecture that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work suggests that PC inference makes the loss landscape more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the challenge of speeding up PC inference on large-scale models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saakaar Bhatnagar, Andrew Comerford, Zelu Xu, Davide Berti Polato, Araz Banaeizadeh, Alessandro Ferraris</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for lithium-ion batteries rapidly increases there is a need to design these cells in a safe manner to mitigate thermal runaway. Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern. Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics. Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model. In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models. Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting in probabilistic time series is a complex endeavor that extends beyond predicting future values to also quantifying the uncertainty inherent in these predictions. Gaussian process regression stands out as a Bayesian machine learning technique adept at addressing this multifaceted challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach that blends the robustness of this Bayesian technique with the nuanced insights provided by the kernel perspective on quantum models, aimed at advancing quantum kernelized probabilistic forecasting. We incorporate a quantum feature map inspired by Ising interactions and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the temporal dependencies critical for precise forecasting. The optimization of our model's hyperparameters circumvents the need for computationally intensive gradient descent by employing gradient-free Bayesian optimization. Comparative benchmarks against established classical kernel models are provided, affirming that our quantum-enhanced approach achieves competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Klenitskiy, Anna Volodkevich, Anton Pembek, Alexey Vasilev</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommender systems are an important and demanded area of research. Such systems aim to use the order of interactions in a user's history to predict future interactions. The premise is that the order of interactions and sequential patterns play an essential role. Therefore, it is crucial to use datasets that exhibit a sequential structure to evaluate sequential recommenders properly.
  We apply several methods based on the random shuffling of the user's sequence of interactions to assess the strength of sequential structure across 15 datasets, frequently used for sequential recommender systems evaluation in recent research papers presented at top-tier conferences. As shuffling explicitly breaks sequential dependencies inherent in datasets, we estimate the strength of sequential patterns by comparing metrics for shuffled and original versions of the dataset. Our findings show that several popular datasets have a rather weak sequential structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lance Ying, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lionel Wong, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: How do people understand and evaluate claims about others' beliefs, even though these beliefs cannot be directly observed? In this paper, we introduce a cognitive model of epistemic language interpretation, grounded in Bayesian inferences about other agents' goals, beliefs, and intentions: a language-augmented Bayesian theory-of-mind (LaBToM). By translating natural language into an epistemic ``language-of-thought'', then evaluating these translations against the inferences produced by inverting a probabilistic generative model of rational action and perception, LaBToM captures graded plausibility judgments about epistemic claims. We validate our model in an experiment where participants watch an agent navigate a maze to find keys hidden in boxes needed to reach their goal, then rate sentences about the agent's beliefs. In contrast with multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and ablated models, our model correlates highly with human judgments for a wide range of expressions, including modal language, uncertainty expressions, knowledge claims, likelihood comparisons, and attributions of false belief.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojun Tang, Jason E. Black, Tyler S. Williamson, Steve H. Drew</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating Electronic Health Records (EHR) and the application of machine learning present opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of data-driven diabetes prediction. In particular, developing data-driven machine learning models can provide early identification of patients with high risk for diabetes, potentially leading to more effective therapeutic strategies and reduced healthcare costs. However, regulation restrictions create barriers to developing centralized predictive models. This paper addresses the challenges by introducing a federated learning approach, which amalgamates predictive models without centralized data storage and processing, thus avoiding privacy issues. This marks the first application of federated learning to predict diabetes using real clinical datasets in Canada extracted from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) without crossprovince patient data sharing. We address class-imbalance issues through downsampling techniques and compare federated learning performance against province-based and centralized models. Experimental results show that the federated MLP model presents a similar or higher performance compared to the model trained with the centralized approach. However, the federated logistic regression model showed inferior performance compared to its centralized peer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitsuka Kiyohara, Masakazu Ishihata</p>
<p>Abstract: Issues of inequity in U.S. high schools' course scheduling did not previously exist. However, in recent years, with the increase in student population and course variety, students perceive that the course scheduling method is unfair. Current integer programming (IP) methods to the high school scheduling problem (HSSP) fall short in addressing these fairness concerns. The purpose of this research is to develop a solution methodology that generates feasible and fair course schedules using student preferences. Utilizing principles of fairness, which have been well studied in market design, we define the fair high school scheduling problem (FHSSP), a novel extension to the HSSP, and devise a corresponding algorithm based on integer programming to solve the FHSSP. We test our approach on a real course request dataset from a high school in California, USA. Results show that our algorithm can generate schedules that are both feasible and fair. In this paper, we demonstrate that our IP algorithm not only solves the HSSP and FHSSP in the United States but has the potential to be applied to various real-world scheduling problems. Additionally, we show the feasibility of integrating human emotions into mathematical modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) trained on web-scale datasets are largely successful due to their ability to memorize large amounts of training data, even if only present in a few examples. These capabilities are often desirable in evaluation on tasks such as question answering but raise questions about whether these models can exhibit genuine reasoning or succeed only at mimicking patterns from the training data. This distinction is particularly salient in forecasting tasks, where the answer is not present in the training data, and the model must reason to make logical deductions. We present Reasoning and Tools for Forecasting (RTF), a framework of reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically retrieve updated information and run numerical simulation with equipped tools. We evaluate our model with questions from competitive forecasting platforms and demonstrate that our method is competitive with and can outperform human predictions. This suggests that LMs, with the right tools, can indeed think and adapt like humans, offering valuable insights for real-world decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuang Zhao, Donghao Yang, Li Zhang, Xiaoli Lian, Zitian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) endeavors to autonomously rectify issues within specific projects, which generally encompasses three categories of tasks: bug resolution, new feature development, and feature enhancement. Despite extensive research proposing various methodologies, their efficacy in addressing real issues remains unsatisfactory. It's worth noting that, typically, engineers have design rationales (DR) on solution-planed solutions and a set of underlying reasons-before they start patching code. In open-source projects, these DRs are frequently captured in issue logs through project management tools like Jira. This raises a compelling question: How can we leverage DR scattered across the issue logs to efficiently enhance APR? To investigate this premise, we introduce DRCodePilot, an approach designed to augment GPT-4-Turbo's APR capabilities by incorporating DR into the prompt instruction. Furthermore, given GPT-4's constraints in fully grasping the broader project context and occasional shortcomings in generating precise identifiers, we have devised a feedback-based self-reflective framework, in which we prompt GPT-4 to reconsider and refine its outputs by referencing a provided patch and suggested identifiers. We have established a benchmark comprising 938 issue-patch pairs sourced from two open-source repositories hosted on GitHub and Jira. Our experimental results are impressive: DRCodePilot achieves a full-match ratio that is a remarkable 4.7x higher than when GPT-4 is utilized directly. Additionally, the CodeBLEU scores also exhibit promising enhancements. Moreover, our findings reveal that the standalone application of DR can yield promising increase in the full-match ratio across CodeLlama, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 within our benchmark suite. We believe that our DRCodePilot initiative heralds a novel human-in-the-loop avenue for advancing the field of APR.</p>

Manually verifying every claim is highly challenging, underscoring the need for an automated fact-checking system. This paper presents our system designed to address this issue. We utilize the Averitec dataset to assess the veracity of claims. In addition to veracity prediction, our system provides supporting evidence, which is extracted from the dataset. We develop a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant evidence sentences from a knowledge base, which are then inputted along with the claim into a large language model (LLM) for classification. We also evaluate the few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities of multiple LLMs. Our system achieves an 'Averitec' score of 0.33, which is a 22% absolute improvement over the baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongshou Li, Pin Tang, Xinke Li, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Established sampling protocols for 3D point cloud learning, such as Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and Fixed Sample Size (FSS), have long been recognized and utilized. However, real-world data often suffer from corrputions such as sensor noise, which violates the benignness assumption of point cloud in current protocols. Consequently, they are notably vulnerable to noise, posing significant safety risks in critical applications like autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose an enhanced point cloud sampling protocol, PointDR, which comprises two components: 1) Downsampling for key point identification and 2) Resampling for flexible sample size. Furthermore, differentiated strategies are implemented for training and inference processes. Particularly, an isolation-rated weight considering local density is designed for the downsampling method, assisting it in performing random key points selection in the training phase and bypassing noise in the inference phase. A local-geometry-preserved upsampling is incorporated into resampling, facilitating it to maintain a stochastic sample size in the training stage and complete insufficient data in the inference. It is crucial to note that the proposed protocol is free of model architecture altering and extra learning, thus minimal efforts are demanded for its replacement of the existing one. Despite the simplicity, it substantially improves the robustness of point cloud learning, showcased by outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks of corrupted point cloud classification. The code will be available upon the paper's acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are crucial for predicting future climate changes by simulating the Earth systems. However, GCM outputs exhibit systematic biases due to model uncertainties, parameterization simplifications, and inadequate representation of complex climate phenomena. Traditional bias correction methods, which rely on historical observation data and statistical techniques, often neglect unobserved confounders, leading to biased results. This paper proposes a novel bias correction approach to utilize both GCM and observational data to learn a factor model that captures multi-cause latent confounders. Inspired by recent advances in causality based time series deconfounding, our method first constructs a factor model to learn latent confounders from historical data and then applies them to enhance the bias correction process using advanced time series forecasting models. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of precipitation outputs. By addressing unobserved confounders, our approach offers a robust and theoretically grounded solution for climate model bias correction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaozhuang Bai, Zhenzhen Gao, Xuewen Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a dense small cell (DSC) network where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) transmit data to single-antenna users over a shared frequency band. To enhance capacity, a state-of-the-art technique known as noncoherent joint transmission (JT) is applied, enabling users to receive data from multiple coordinated SBSs. However, the sum rate maximization problem with noncoherent JT is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard. While existing optimization-based noncoherent JT algorithms can provide near-optimal performance, they require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, which makes them difficult to be implemeted in DSC networks.To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem.The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions.By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate.In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive advancements across numerous disciplines, yet the critical issue of knowledge conflicts, a major source of hallucinations, has rarely been studied. Only a few research explored the conflicts between the inherent knowledge of LLMs and the retrieved contextual knowledge. However, a thorough assessment of knowledge conflict in LLMs is still missing. Motivated by this research gap, we present ConflictBank, the first comprehensive benchmark developed to systematically evaluate knowledge conflicts from three aspects: (i) conflicts encountered in retrieved knowledge, (ii) conflicts within the models' encoded knowledge, and (iii) the interplay between these conflict forms. Our investigation delves into four model families and twelve LLM instances, meticulously analyzing conflicts stemming from misinformation, temporal discrepancies, and semantic divergences. Based on our proposed novel construction framework, we create 7,453,853 claim-evidence pairs and 553,117 QA pairs. We present numerous findings on model scale, conflict causes, and conflict types.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengjie Liu, Ruibo Hou, Yves Lepage</p>
<p>Abstract: Back translation, as a technique for extending a dataset, is widely used by researchers in low-resource language translation tasks. It typically translates from the target to the source language to ensure high-quality translation results. This paper proposes a novel way of utilizing a monolingual corpus on the source side to assist Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in low-resource settings. We realize this concept by employing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which augments the training data for the discriminator while mitigating the interference of low-quality synthetic monolingual translations with the generator. Additionally, this paper integrates Translation Memory (TM) with NMT, increasing the amount of data available to the generator. Moreover, we propose a novel procedure to filter the synthetic sentence pairs during the augmentation process, ensuring the high quality of the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Zhang, Yixuan Lyu, Qian Yu, Hanyang Liu, Huimin Ma, Ding Yuan, Yifan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), despite continuous improvements in segmentation performance, the underlying mechanisms of effective camouflage remain poorly understood, akin to a black box. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive study to examine the impact of camouflage attributes on the effectiveness of camouflage patterns, offering a quantitative framework for the evaluation of camouflage designs. To support this analysis, we have compiled the first dataset comprising descriptions of camouflaged objects and their attribute contributions, termed COD-Text And X-attributions (COD-TAX). Moreover, drawing inspiration from the hierarchical process by which humans process information: from high-level textual descriptions of overarching scenarios, through mid-level summaries of local areas, to low-level pixel data for detailed analysis. We have developed a robust framework that combines textual and visual information for the task of COS, named Attribution CUe Modeling with Eye-fixation Network (ACUMEN). ACUMEN demonstrates superior performance, outperforming nine leading methods across three widely-used datasets. We conclude by highlighting key insights derived from the attributes identified in our study. Code: https://github.com/lyu-yx/ACUMEN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical abstractive summarization faces the challenge of balancing faithfulness and informativeness. Current methods often sacrifice key information for faithfulness or introduce confabulations when prioritizing informativeness. While recent advancements in techniques like in-context learning (ICL) and fine-tuning have improved medical summarization, they often overlook crucial aspects such as faithfulness and informativeness without considering advanced methods like model reasoning and self-improvement. Moreover, the field lacks a unified benchmark, hindering systematic evaluation due to varied metrics and datasets. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting a comprehensive benchmark of six advanced abstractive summarization methods across three diverse datasets using five standardized metrics. Building on these findings, we propose uMedSum, a modular hybrid summarization framework that introduces novel approaches for sequential confabulation removal followed by key missing information addition, ensuring both faithfulness and informativeness. Our work improves upon previous GPT-4-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical summarization methods, significantly outperforming them in both quantitative metrics and qualitative domain expert evaluations. Notably, we achieve an average relative performance improvement of 11.8% in reference-free metrics over the previous SOTA. Doctors prefer uMedSum's summaries 6 times more than previous SOTA in difficult cases where there are chances of confabulations or missing information. These results highlight uMedSum's effectiveness and generalizability across various datasets and metrics, marking a significant advancement in medical summarization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning is widely utilized across various industries. Identifying the appropriate machine learning models and datasets for specific tasks is crucial for the effective industrial application of machine learning. However, this requires expertise in both machine learning and the relevant domain, leading to a high learning cost. Therefore, research focused on extracting combinations of tasks, machine learning models, and datasets from academic papers is critically important, as it can facilitate the automatic recommendation of suitable methods. Conventional information extraction methods from academic papers have been limited to identifying machine learning models and other entities as named entities. To address this issue, this study proposes a methodology extracting tasks, machine learning methods, and dataset names from scientific papers and analyzing the relationships between these information by using LLM, embedding model, and network clustering. The proposed method's expression extraction performance, when using Llama3, achieves an F-score exceeding 0.8 across various categories, confirming its practical utility. Benchmarking results on financial domain papers have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, providing insights into the use of the latest datasets, including those related to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shresth Verma, Niclas Boehmer, Lingkai Kong, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaowen Huang, Jun Der Leu, Baoli Lu, Yan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Risk analysis is an important business decision support task in customer relationship management (CRM), involving the identification of potential risks or challenges that may affect customer satisfaction, retention rates, and overall business performance. To enhance risk analysis in CRM, this paper combines the advantages of quantile region convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (QRCNN-LSTM) and cross-attention mechanisms for modeling. The QRCNN-LSTM model combines sequence modeling with deep learning architectures commonly used in natural language processing tasks, enabling the capture of both local and global dependencies in sequence data. The cross-attention mechanism enhances interactions between different input data parts, allowing the model to focus on specific areas or features relevant to CRM risk analysis. By applying QRCNN-LSTM and cross-attention mechanisms to CRM risk analysis, empirical evidence demonstrates that this approach can effectively identify potential risks and provide data-driven support for business decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging collaborative learning paradigm that aims to protect data privacy. Unfortunately, recent works show FL algorithms are vulnerable to the serious data reconstruction attacks. However, existing works lack a theoretical foundation on to what extent the devices' data can be reconstructed and the effectiveness of these attacks cannot be compared fairly due to their unstable performance. To address this deficiency, we propose a theoretical framework to understand data reconstruction attacks to FL. Our framework involves bounding the data reconstruction error and an attack's error bound reflects its inherent attack effectiveness. Under the framework, we can theoretically compare the effectiveness of existing attacks. For instance, our results on multiple datasets validate that the iDLG attack inherently outperforms the DLG attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Zhou, Qile Liu, Jiyuan Wang, Zhen Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals are widely used in affective brain-computer interface (aBCI) applications. However, not all continuously collected EEG signals are relevant or meaningful to the task at hand (e.g., wondering thoughts). On the other hand, manually labeling the relevant parts is nearly impossible due to varying engagement patterns across different tasks and individuals. Therefore, effectively and efficiently identifying the important parts from continuous EEG recordings is crucial for downstream BCI tasks, as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep reinforcement learning framework, called Emotion-Agent, to automatically identify relevant and informative emotional moments from continuous EEG signals. Specifically, Emotion-Agent involves unsupervised deep reinforcement learning combined with a heuristic algorithm. We first use the heuristic algorithm to perform an initial global search and form prototype representations of the EEG signals, which facilitates the efficient exploration of the signal space and identify potential regions of interest. Then, we design distribution-prototype reward functions to estimate the interactions between samples and prototypes, ensuring that the identified parts are both relevant and representative of the underlying emotional states. Emotion-Agent is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to achieve stable and efficient convergence. Our experiments compare the performance with and without Emotion-Agent. The results demonstrate that selecting relevant and informative emotional parts before inputting them into downstream tasks enhances the accuracy and reliability of aBCI applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of code generation techniques, selecting the correct code solution from multiple candidate solutions has become a crucial task. This study proposes AutoTest, a novel technique that combines automated test case generation with code solution execution to optimize the selection process using an evolutionary genetic algorithm. Firstly, AutoTest utilizes large pre-trained language models such as codegen-16B, code-davinci-002, and incoder-6B to provide code solutions and their corresponding test cases. Then, by executing the code solutions and evaluating their performance on the test cases, a consensus set is formed. Fine-grained ranking is achieved through the selection, mutation, and crossover mechanisms based on the evolutionary genetic algorithm, with the adjustment of alpha and beta parameters. Finally, the best code solution is chosen. AutoTest demonstrates significant performance improvements on the HumanEval benchmark test. The HumanEval dataset consists of 164 programming problems, and AutoTest achieves approximately a 10% improvement over the baseline method in terms of pass@1 score.</p>

<p>Abstract: Grid startup, an integral component of the power system, holds strategic importance for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the electrical grid. However, current methodologies for in-depth analysis and precise prediction of grid startup scenarios are inadequate. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method based on the Transformer-LSTM-PSO model. This model uniquely combines the Transformer's self-attention mechanism, LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, and the parameter tuning features of the particle swarm optimization algorithm. It is designed to more effectively capture the complex temporal relationships in grid startup schemes. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with our model achieving lower RMSE and MAE values across multiple datasets compared to existing benchmarks, particularly in the NYISO Electric Market dataset where the RMSE was reduced by approximately 15% and the MAE by 20% compared to conventional models. Our main contribution is the development of a Transformer-LSTM-PSO model that significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of smart grid startup predictions. The application of the Transformer-LSTM-PSO model represents a significant advancement in smart grid predictive analytics, concurrently fostering the development of more reliable and intelligent grid management systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting the response of a cancer cell line to a therapeutic drug is pivotal for personalized medicine. Despite numerous deep learning methods that have been developed for drug response prediction, integrating diverse information about biological entities and predicting the directional response remain major challenges. Here, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model, DRExplainer, which leverages a directed graph convolutional network to enhance the prediction in a directed bipartite network framework. DRExplainer constructs a directed bipartite network integrating multi-omics profiles of cell lines, the chemical structure of drugs and known drug response to achieve directed prediction. Then, DRExplainer identifies the most relevant subgraph to each prediction in this directed bipartite network by learning a mask, facilitating critical medical decision-making. Additionally, we introduce a quantifiable method for model interpretability that leverages a ground truth benchmark dataset curated from biological features. In computational experiments, DRExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art predictive methods and another graph-based explanation method under the same experimental setting. Finally, the case studies further validate the interpretability and the effectiveness of DRExplainer in predictive novel drug response.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congchi Yin, Feng Li, Shu Zhang, Zike Wang, Jun Shao, Piji Li, Jianhua Chen, Xun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The clinical diagnosis of most mental disorders primarily relies on the conversations between psychiatrist and patient. The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymous patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and achieves text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree from a tool agent. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k, which is built upon 1000 cleaned real patient cases by cooperating with a pioneering psychiatric hospital, and contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labelled Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset. Human evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDD-5k dataset successfully simulates human-like diagnostic process of mental disorders. The dataset and code will become publicly accessible in https://github.com/lemonsis/MDD-5k.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jooyoung Lee, Se Yoon Jeong, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike fixed- or variable-rate image coding, progressive image coding (PIC) aims to compress various qualities of images into a single bitstream, increasing the versatility of bitstream utilization and providing high compression efficiency compared to simulcast compression. Research on neural network (NN)-based PIC is in its early stages, mainly focusing on applying varying quantization step sizes to the transformed latent representations in a hierarchical manner. These approaches are designed to compress only the progressively added information as the quality improves, considering that a wider quantization interval for lower-quality compression includes multiple narrower sub-intervals for higher-quality compression. However, the existing methods are based on handcrafted quantization hierarchies, resulting in sub-optimal compression efficiency. In this paper, we propose an NN-based progressive coding method that firstly utilizes learned quantization step sizes via learning for each quantization layer. We also incorporate selective compression with which only the essential representation components are compressed for each quantization layer. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher coding efficiency than the existing approaches with decreased decoding time and reduced model size.</p>

Inspired by the idea of large language model Chain of Thought (CoT), this paper introduces a Sentiment Analysis of Thinking (SAoT) framework. The framework first analyzes the implicit aspects and opinions in the text using common sense and thinking chain capabilities.

Specifically, on the restaurant dataset, the F1 score reaches 75.27, accompanied by an ISA score of 66.29. Similarly, on the computer dataset, the F1 score achieves 76.50, while the ISA score amounts to 73.46.

<p>Abstract: The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs. These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization. Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue. Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs). These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution. First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs. Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code.To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods. SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive performance in graph domain adaptation. However, extensive source graphs could be unavailable in real-world scenarios due to privacy and storage concerns. To this end, we investigate an underexplored yet practical problem of source-free graph domain adaptation, which transfers knowledge from source models instead of source graphs to a target domain. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel GNN-based approach called Rank and Align (RNA), which ranks graph similarities with spectral seriation for robust semantics learning, and aligns inharmonic graphs with harmonic graphs which close to the source domain for subgraph extraction. In particular, to overcome label scarcity, we employ the spectral seriation algorithm to infer the robust pairwise rankings, which can guide semantic learning using a similarity learning objective. To depict distribution shifts, we utilize spectral clustering and the silhouette coefficient to detect harmonic graphs, which the source model can easily classify. To reduce potential domain discrepancy, we extract domain-invariant subgraphs from inharmonic graphs by an adversarial edge sampling process, which guides the invariant learning of GNNs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RNA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles with a self-evolving ability are expected to cope with unknown scenarios in the real-world environment. Take advantage of trial and error mechanism, reinforcement learning is able to self evolve by learning the optimal policy, and it is particularly well suitable for solving decision-making problems. However, reinforcement learning suffers from safety issues and low learning efficiency, especially in the continuous action space. Therefore, the motivation of this paper is to address the above problem by proposing a hybrid Mechanism-Experience-Learning augmented approach. Specifically, to realize the efficient self-evolution, the driving tendency by analogy with human driving experience is proposed to reduce the search space of the autonomous driving problem, while the constrained optimization problem based on a mechanistic model is designed to ensure safety during the self-evolving process. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of generating safe and reasonable actions in various complex scenarios, improving the performance of the autonomous driving system. Compared to conventional reinforcement learning, the safety and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are greatly improved. The training process is collision-free, and the training time is equivalent to less than 10 minutes in the real world.</p>

This difference can introduce imperceptible inference parameter deviations, posing challenges for LLMs in effectively utilizing and reasoning with structured data to accurately infer factual knowledge. To this end, we propose a benchmark named StructFact, to evaluate the structural reasoning capabilities of LLMs in inferring factual knowledge. StructFact comprises 8,340 factual questions encompassing various tasks, domains, timelines, and regions. This benchmark allows us to investigate the capability of LLMs across five factual tasks derived from the unique characteristics of structural facts. Extensive experiments on a set of LLMs with different training strategies reveal the limitations of current LLMs in inferring factual knowledge from structured data. We present this benchmark as a compass to navigate the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in reasoning with structured data for knowledge-sensitive tasks, and to encourage advancements in related real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: This study presents a two-level Deep Domain Decomposition Method (Deep-DDM) augmented with a coarse-level network for solving boundary value problems using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The addition of the coarse level network improves scalability and convergence rates compared to the single level method. Tested on a Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the two-level deep DDM demonstrates superior performance, maintaining efficient convergence regardless of the number of subdomains. This advance provides a more scalable and effective approach to solving complex partial differential equations with machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicy Scaria, Silvester John Joseph Kennedy, Thomas Latinovich, Deepak Subramani</p>
<p>Abstract: Relying on human experts to evaluate CEFR speaking assessments in an e-learning environment creates scalability challenges, as it limits how quickly and widely assessments can be conducted. We aim to automate the evaluation of CEFR B2 English speaking assessments in e-learning environments from conversation transcripts. First, we evaluate the capability of leading open source and commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) to score a candidate's performance across various criteria in the CEFR B2 speaking exam in both global and India-specific contexts. Next, we create a new expert-validated, CEFR-aligned synthetic conversational dataset with transcripts that are rated at different assessment scores. In addition, new instruction-tuned datasets are developed from the English Vocabulary Profile (up to CEFR B2 level) and the CEFR-SP WikiAuto datasets. Finally, using these new datasets, we perform parameter efficient instruction tuning of Mistral Instruct 7B v0.2 to develop a family of models called EvalYaks. Four models in this family are for assessing the four sections of the CEFR B2 speaking exam, one for identifying the CEFR level of vocabulary and generating level-specific vocabulary, and another for detecting the CEFR level of text and generating level-specific text. EvalYaks achieved an average acceptable accuracy of 96%, a degree of variation of 0.35 levels, and performed 3 times better than the next best model. This demonstrates that a 7B parameter LLM instruction tuned with high-quality CEFR-aligned assessment data can effectively evaluate and score CEFR B2 English speaking assessments, offering a promising solution for scalable, automated language proficiency evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishik Nagar, Viktor Schlegel, Thanh-Tung Nguyen, Hao Li, Yuping Wu, Kuluhan Binici, Stefan Winkler</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration. To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work reimplements a recent semantic bootstrapping child-language acquisition model, which was originally designed for English, and trains it to learn a new language: Hebrew. The model learns from pairs of utterances and logical forms as meaning representations, and acquires both syntax and word meanings simultaneously. The results show that the model mostly transfers to Hebrew, but that a number of factors, including the richer morphology in Hebrew, makes the learning slower and less robust. This suggests that a clear direction for future work is to enable the model to leverage the similarities between different word forms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Sakai, Adam Nohejl, Jiangnan Hang, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: The natural language understanding (NLU) performance of large language models (LLMs) has been evaluated across various tasks and datasets. The existing evaluation methods, however, do not take into account the variance in scores due to differences in prompts, which leads to unfair evaluation and comparison of NLU performance. Moreover, evaluation designed for specific prompts is inappropriate for instruction tuning, which aims to perform well with any prompt. It is therefore necessary to find a way to measure NLU performance in a fair manner, considering score variance between different instruction templates. In this study, we provide English and Japanese cross-lingual datasets for evaluating the NLU performance of LLMs, which include multiple instruction templates for fair evaluation of each task, along with regular expressions to constrain the output format. Furthermore, we propose the Sharpe score as an evaluation metric that takes into account the variance in scores between templates. Comprehensive analysis of English and Japanese LLMs reveals that the high variance among templates has a significant impact on the fair evaluation of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The potential of deep learning in clinical speech processing is immense, yet the hurdles of limited and imbalanced clinical data samples loom large. This article addresses these challenges by showcasing the utilization of automatic speech recognition and self-supervised learning representations, pre-trained on extensive datasets of normal speech. This innovative approach aims to estimate voice quality of patients with impaired vocal systems. Experiments involve checks on PVQD dataset, covering various causes of vocal system damage in English, and a Japanese dataset focusing on patients with Parkinson's disease before and after undergoing subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) surgery. The results on PVQD reveal a notable correlation (>0.8 on PCC) and an extraordinary accuracy (<0.5 on MSE) in predicting Grade, Breathy, and Asthenic indicators. Meanwhile, progress has been achieved in predicting the voice quality of patients in the context of STN-DBS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhui Li, Xinqi Su, Dan Song, Lanjun Wang, Kun Zhang, An-An Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior image-text matching methods have shown remarkable performance on many benchmark datasets, but most of them overlook the bias in the dataset, which exists in intra-modal and inter-modal, and tend to learn the spurious correlations that extremely degrade the generalization ability of the model. Furthermore, these methods often incorporate biased external knowledge from large-scale datasets as prior knowledge into image-text matching model, which is inevitable to force model further learn biased associations. To address above limitations, this paper firstly utilizes Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to illustrate how intra- and inter-modal confounders damage the image-text matching. Then, we employ backdoor adjustment to propose an innovative Deconfounded Causal Inference Network (DCIN) for image-text matching task. DCIN (1) decomposes the intra- and inter-modal confounders and incorporates them into the encoding stage of visual and textual features, effectively eliminating the spurious correlations during image-text matching, and (2) uses causal inference to mitigate biases of external knowledge. Consequently, the model can learn causality instead of spurious correlations caused by dataset bias. Extensive experiments on two well-known benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MSCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiyun Wang, Masahiro Suzuki, Hiroki Sakaji, Kiyoshi Izumi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various machine learning (ML) tasks. Given the high costs of creating annotated datasets for supervised learning, LLMs offer a valuable alternative by enabling effective few-shot in-context learning. However, these models can produce hallucinations, particularly in domains with incomplete knowledge. Additionally, current methods for knowledge distillation using LLMs often struggle to enhance the effectiveness of both teacher and student models. To address these challenges, we introduce DualChecker, an innovative framework designed to mitigate hallucinations and improve the performance of both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation. DualChecker employs ContextAligner to ensure that the context provided by teacher models aligns with human labeling standards. It also features a dynamic checker system that enhances model interaction: one component re-prompts teacher models with more detailed content when they show low confidence, and another identifies borderline cases from student models to refine the teaching templates. This interactive process promotes continuous improvement and effective knowledge transfer between the models. We evaluate DualChecker using a green innovation textual dataset that includes binary, multiclass, and token classification tasks. The experimental results show that DualChecker significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 17% improvement in F1 score for teacher models and 10% for student models. Notably, student models fine-tuned with LLM predictions perform comparably to those fine-tuned with actual data, even in a challenging domain. We make all datasets, models, and code from this research publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niloofar Azizi, Nils Kriege, Horst Bischof</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in handling graph-structured data but often underperform in link prediction tasks compared to classical methods, mainly due to the limitations of the commonly used Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs). Notably, their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Our study presents a novel method to enhance the expressivity of GNNs by embedding induced subgraphs into the graph Laplacian matrix's eigenbasis. We introduce a Learnable Lanczos algorithm with Linear Constraints (LLwLC), proposing two novel subgraph extraction strategies: encoding vertex-deleted subgraphs and applying Neumann eigenvalue constraints. For the former, we conjecture that LLwLC establishes a universal approximator, offering efficient time complexity. The latter focuses on link representations enabling differentiation between $k$-regular graphs and node automorphism, a vital aspect for link prediction tasks. Our approach results in an extremely lightweight architecture, reducing the need for extensive training datasets. Empirically, our method improves performance in challenging link prediction tasks across benchmark datasets, establishing its practical utility and supporting our theoretical findings. Notably, LLwLC achieves 20x and 10x speedup by only requiring 5% and 10% data from the PubMed and OGBL-Vessel datasets while comparing to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that smaller language models can acquire substantial reasoning abilities when fine-tuned with reasoning exemplars crafted by a significantly larger teacher model. We explore this paradigm for the financial domain, focusing on the challenge of answering questions that require multi-hop numerical reasoning over financial texts. We assess the performance of several smaller models that have been fine-tuned to generate programs that encode the required financial reasoning and calculations. Our findings demonstrate that these fine-tuned smaller models approach the performance of the teacher model.
  To provide a granular analysis of model performance, we propose an approach to investigate the specific student model capabilities that are enhanced by fine-tuning. Our empirical analysis indicates that fine-tuning refines the student models ability to express and apply the required financial concepts along with adapting the entity extraction for the specific data format. In addition, we hypothesize and demonstrate that comparable financial reasoning capability can be induced using relatively smaller datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image datasets in the real world are often unlabeled and imbalanced, and Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) can utilize unlabeled data to improve an object detector. However, existing approaches predominantly assumed that the unlabeled data and test data do not contain out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. The few open-set semi-supervised object detection methods have two weaknesses: first, the class imbalance is not considered; second, the OOD instances are distinguished and simply discarded during pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we consider the open-set semi-supervised object detection problem which leverages unlabeled data that contain OOD classes to improve object detection for medical images. Our study incorporates two key innovations: Category Control Embed (CCE) and out-of-distribution Detection Fusion Classifier (OODFC). CCE is designed to tackle dataset imbalance by constructing a Foreground information Library, while OODFC tackles open-set challenges by integrating the ``unknown'' information into basic pseudo-labels. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art SSOD performance, achieving a 4.25 mAP improvement on the public Parasite dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunpeng Zhou, Kangjie Ning, Qianqian Shen, Sheng Zhou, Zhi Yu, Haishuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recently introduced Segment Anything Model (SAM), a Visual Foundation Model (VFM), has demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot segmentation tasks across diverse natural image datasets. Despite its success, SAM encounters noticeably performance degradation when applied to specific domains, such as medical images. Current efforts to address this issue have involved fine-tuning strategies, intended to bolster the generalizability of the vanilla SAM. However, these approaches still predominantly necessitate the utilization of domain specific expert-level prompts during the evaluation phase, which severely constrains the model's practicality.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel self-prompting based fine-tuning approach, called SAM-SP, tailored for extending the vanilla SAM model. Specifically, SAM-SP leverages the output from the previous iteration of the model itself as prompts to guide subsequent iteration of the model. This self-prompting module endeavors to learn how to generate useful prompts autonomously and alleviates the dependence on expert prompts during the evaluation phase, significantly broadening SAM's applicability. Additionally, we integrate a self-distillation module to enhance the self-prompting process further. Extensive experiments across various domain specific datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed SAM-SP. Our SAM-SP not only alleviates the reliance on expert prompts but also exhibits superior segmentation performance comparing to the state-of-the-art task-specific segmentation approaches, the vanilla SAM, and SAM-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transcriptome foundation models TFMs hold great promises of deciphering the transcriptomic language that dictate diverse cell functions by self-supervised learning on large-scale single-cell gene expression data, and ultimately unraveling the complex mechanisms of human diseases. However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present \textbf{s}ingle \textbf{c}ell, \textbf{Cell}-\textbf{o}ntology guided TFM scCello. We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry. Our TFM demonstrates competitive generalization and transferability performance over the existing TFMs on biologically important tasks including identifying novel cell types of unseen cells, prediction of cell-type-specific marker genes, and cancer drug responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: The facial sketch synthesis (FSS) model, capable of generating sketch portraits from given facial photographs, holds profound implications across multiple domains, encompassing cross-modal face recognition, entertainment, art, media, among others. However, the production of high-quality sketches remains a formidable task, primarily due to the challenges and flaws associated with three key factors: (1) the scarcity of artist-drawn data, (2) the constraints imposed by limited style types, and (3) the deficiencies of processing input information in existing models. To address these difficulties, we propose a lightweight end-to-end synthesis model that efficiently converts images to corresponding multi-stylized sketches, obviating the necessity for any supplementary inputs (\eg, 3D geometry). In this study, we overcome the issue of data insufficiency by incorporating semi-supervised learning into the training process. Additionally, we employ a feature extraction module and style embeddings to proficiently steer the generative transformer during the iterative prediction of masked image tokens, thus achieving a continuous stylized output that retains facial features accurately in sketches. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous algorithms across multiple benchmarks, exhibiting a discernible disparity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the behavior of complex dynamical systems, characterized by high-dimensional multivariate time series(MTS) in interconnected sensor networks, is crucial for informed decision-making in various applications to minimize risk. While graph forecasting networks(GFNs) are ideal for forecasting MTS data that exhibit spatio-temporal dependencies, prior works rely solely on the domain-specific knowledge of time-series variables inter-relationships to model the nonlinear dynamics, neglecting inherent relational structural dependencies among the variables within the MTS data. In contrast, contemporary works infer relational structures from MTS data but neglect domain-specific knowledge. The proposed hybrid architecture addresses these limitations by combining both domain-specific knowledge and implicit knowledge of the relational structure underlying the MTS data using Knowledge-Based Compositional Generalization. The hybrid architecture shows promising results on multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art forecasting methods. Additionally, the architecture models the time varying uncertainty of multi-horizon forecasts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in static protein structure collection and prediction, the dynamic behavior of proteins, one of their most vital characteristics, has been largely overlooked in prior research. This oversight can be attributed to the limited availability, diversity, and heterogeneity of dynamic protein datasets. To address this gap, we propose to enhance existing prestigious static 3D protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical properties. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale dataset, Dynamic PDB, encompassing approximately 12.6K proteins, each subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of physical properties, including atomic velocities and forces, potential and kinetic energies of proteins, and the temperature of the simulation environment, recorded at 1 picosecond intervals throughout the simulations. For benchmarking purposes, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for the task of trajectory prediction. To demonstrate the value of integrating richer physical properties in the study of protein dynamics and related model design, we base our approach on the SE(3) diffusion model and incorporate these physical properties into the trajectory prediction process. Preliminary results indicate that this straightforward extension of the SE(3) model yields improved accuracy, as measured by MAE and RMSD, when the proposed physical properties are taken into consideration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bastien van Delft, Tommaso Martorella, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditioning image generation facilitates seamless editing and the creation of photorealistic images. However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe degradation or OoD inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein structure prediction is pivotal for understanding the structure-function relationship of proteins, advancing biological research, and facilitating pharmaceutical development and experimental design. While deep learning methods and the expanded availability of experimental 3D protein structures have accelerated structure prediction, the dynamic nature of protein structures has received limited attention. This study introduces an innovative 4D diffusion model incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data to learn dynamic protein structures. Our approach is distinguished by the following components: (1) a unified diffusion model capable of generating dynamic protein structures, including both the backbone and side chains, utilizing atomic grouping and side-chain dihedral angle predictions; (2) a reference network that enhances structural consistency by integrating the latent embeddings of the initial 3D protein structures; and (3) a motion alignment module aimed at improving temporal structural coherence across multiple time steps. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based model aimed at predicting protein trajectories across multiple time steps simultaneously. Validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our model exhibits high accuracy in predicting dynamic 3D structures of proteins containing up to 256 amino acids over 32 time steps, effectively capturing both local flexibility in stable states and significant conformational changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagar Srinivas Sakhinana, Shivam Gupta, Krishna Sai Sudhir Aripirala, Venkataramana Runkana</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting the behaviour of complex dynamical systems such as interconnected sensor networks characterized by high-dimensional multivariate time series(MTS) is of paramount importance for making informed decisions and planning for the future in a broad spectrum of applications. Graph forecasting networks(GFNs) are well-suited for forecasting MTS data that exhibit spatio-temporal dependencies. However, most prior works of GFN-based methods on MTS forecasting rely on domain-expertise to model the nonlinear dynamics of the system, but neglect the potential to leverage the inherent relational-structural dependencies among time series variables underlying MTS data. On the other hand, contemporary works attempt to infer the relational structure of the complex dependencies between the variables and simultaneously learn the nonlinear dynamics of the interconnected system but neglect the possibility of incorporating domain-specific prior knowledge to improve forecast accuracy. To this end, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines explicit prior knowledge with implicit knowledge of the relational structure within the MTS data. It jointly learns intra-series temporal dependencies and inter-series spatial dependencies by encoding time-conditioned structural spatio-temporal inductive biases to provide more accurate and reliable forecasts. It also models the time-varying uncertainty of the multi-horizon forecasts to support decision-making by providing estimates of prediction uncertainty. The proposed architecture has shown promising results on multiple benchmark datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting methods by a significant margin. We report and discuss the ablation studies to validate our forecasting architecture.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12426">Enhanced Infield Agriculture with Interpretable Machine Learning Approaches for Crop Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudi Murindanyi, Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende, Rahman Sanya, Rose Nakibuule, Andrew Katumba</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing popularity of Artificial Intelligence in recent years has led to a surge in interest in image classification, especially in the agricultural sector. With the help of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, the sector has undergone a significant transformation, leading to the development of new techniques for crop classification in the field. Despite the extensive research on various image classification techniques, most have limitations such as low accuracy, limited use of data, and a lack of reporting model size and prediction. The most significant limitation of all is the need for model explainability. This research evaluates four different approaches for crop classification, namely traditional ML with handcrafted feature extraction methods like SIFT, ORB, and Color Histogram; Custom Designed CNN and established DL architecture like AlexNet; transfer learning on five models pre-trained using ImageNet such as EfficientNetV2, ResNet152V2, Xception, Inception-ResNetV2, MobileNetV3; and cutting-edge foundation models like YOLOv8 and DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer Model. All models performed well, but Xception outperformed all of them in terms of generalization, achieving 98% accuracy on the test data, with a model size of 80.03 MB and a prediction time of 0.0633 seconds. A key aspect of this research was the application of Explainable AI to provide the explainability of all the models. This journal presents the explainability of Xception model with LIME, SHAP, and GradCAM, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in the models' predictions. This study highlights the importance of selecting the right model according to task-specific needs. It also underscores the important role of explainability in deploying AI in agriculture, providing insightful information to help enhance AI-driven crop management strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tahmina Khanam, Hamid Laga, Mohammed Bennamoun, Guanjin Wang, Ferdous Sohel, Farid Boussaid, Guan Wang, Anuj Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the first comprehensive approach for modeling and analyzing the spatiotemporal shape variability in tree-like 4D objects, i.e., 3D objects whose shapes bend, stretch, and change in their branching structure over time as they deform, grow, and interact with their environment. Our key contribution is the representation of tree-like 3D shapes using Square Root Velocity Function Trees (SRVFT). By solving the spatial registration in the SRVFT space, which is equipped with an L2 metric, 4D tree-shaped structures become time-parameterized trajectories in this space. This reduces the problem of modeling and analyzing 4D tree-like shapes to that of modeling and analyzing elastic trajectories in the SRVFT space, where elasticity refers to time warping. In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical representation of the shape space of such trajectories, a Riemannian metric on that space, and computational tools for fast and accurate spatiotemporal registration and geodesics computation between 4D tree-shaped structures. Leveraging these building blocks, we develop a full framework for modelling the spatiotemporal variability using statistical models and generating novel 4D tree-like structures from a set of exemplars. We demonstrate and validate the proposed framework using real 4D plant data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Wu, Licheng Sun, Yingjie Liu, Jian Yang, Hanlin Dong, Shing-Ho J. Lin, Xuan Tang, Jinpeng Mi, Bo Jin, Xian Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) can effectively handle rotational symmetry data. They assume uniform and strict rotational symmetry across all features, as the transformations under the specific group. However, real-world data rarely conforms to strict rotational symmetry commonly referred to as Rotational Symmetry-Breaking in the system or dataset, making GConv unable to adapt effectively to this phenomenon. Motivated by this, we propose a simple but highly effective method to address this problem, which utilizes a set of learnable biases called the $G$-Biases under the group order to break strict group constraints and achieve \textbf{R}elaxed \textbf{R}otational \textbf{E}quivarant \textbf{Conv}olution (RREConv). We conduct extensive experiments to validate Relaxed Rotational Equivariance on rotational symmetry groups $\mathcal{C}_n$ (e.g. $\mathcal{C}_2$, $\mathcal{C}_4$, and $\mathcal{C}_6$ groups). Further experiments demonstrate that our proposed RREConv-based methods achieve excellent performance, compared to existing GConv-based methods in classification and detection tasks on natural image datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computer-based analysis of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is crucial. However, a medically annotated WCE dataset for training and evaluation of automatic classification, detection, and segmentation of bleeding and non-bleeding frames is currently lacking. The present work focused on development of a medically annotated WCE dataset called WCEbleedGen for automatic classification, detection, and segmentation of bleeding and non-bleeding frames. It comprises 2,618 WCE bleeding and non-bleeding frames which were collected from various internet resources and existing WCE datasets. A comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation of the developed dataset was done using nine classification-based, three detection-based, and three segmentation-based deep learning models. The dataset is of high-quality, is class-balanced and contains single and multiple bleeding sites. Overall, our standard benchmark results show that Visual Geometric Group (VGG) 19, You Only Look Once version 8 nano (YOLOv8n), and Link network (Linknet) performed best in automatic classification, detection, and segmentation-based evaluations, respectively. Automatic bleeding diagnosis is crucial for WCE video interpretations. This diverse dataset will aid in developing of real-time, multi-task learning-based innovative solutions for automatic bleeding diagnosis in WCE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Wang, Yantai Yang, Qilong Wang, Kaixin Li, Linfeng Zhang, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to synthesize a small dataset capable of performing comparably to the original dataset. Despite the success of numerous DD methods, theoretical exploration of this area remains unaddressed. In this paper, we take an initial step towards understanding various matching-based DD methods from the perspective of sample difficulty. We begin by empirically examining sample difficulty, measured by gradient norm, and observe that different matching-based methods roughly correspond to specific difficulty tendencies. We then extend the neural scaling laws of data pruning to DD to theoretically explain these matching-based methods. Our findings suggest that prioritizing the synthesis of easier samples from the original dataset can enhance the quality of distilled datasets, especially in low IPC (image-per-class) settings. Based on our empirical observations and theoretical analysis, we introduce the Sample Difficulty Correction (SDC) approach, designed to predominantly generate easier samples to achieve higher dataset quality. Our SDC can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods as a plugin with minimal code adjustments. Experimental results demonstrate that adding SDC generates higher-quality distilled datasets across 7 distillation methods and 6 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunsheng Tang, Wenbo Zhou, Jie Zhang, Aishan Liu, Gelei Deng, Shuai Li, Peigui Qi, Weiming Zhang, Tianwei Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in natural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify societal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this issue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs. However, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently introduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a comprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment, Reduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating gender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender equality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity, explainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these criteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to assess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized and realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such as transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective debiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and specialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without compromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions peaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs. Importantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream language tasks, remaining below 2%. By offering a realistic assessment and tailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent a significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details are available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embedding models play a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by creating text embeddings used in various tasks such as information retrieval and assessing semantic text similarity. This paper focuses on research related to embedding models in the Russian language.

The research also assesses a representative set of Russian and multilingual models on the proposed benchmark. The findings indicate that the new model achieves results that are on par with state-of-the-art models in Russian.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Sarparast, Aldo Zaimi, Maximilian Ebert, Michael-Rock Goldsmith</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein dynamics play a crucial role in many biological processes and drug interactions. However, measuring, and simulating protein dynamics is challenging and time-consuming. While machine learning holds promise in deciphering the determinants of protein dynamics from structural information, most existing methods for protein representation learning operate at the residue level, ignoring the finer details of atomic interactions. In this work, we propose for the first time to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn protein representations at the atomic level and predict B-factors from protein 3D structures. The B-factor reflects the atomic displacement of atoms in proteins, and can serve as a surrogate for protein flexibility. We compared different GNN architectures to assess their performance. The Meta-GNN model achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.71 on a large and diverse test set of over 4k proteins (17M atoms) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), outperforming previous methods by a large margin. Our work demonstrates the potential of representations learned by GNNs for protein flexibility prediction and other related tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Earle, Zehua Jiang, Julian Togelius</p>
<p>Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) has been introduced as a means by which controllable designer agents can be trained based only on a set of computable metrics acting as a proxy for the level's quality and key characteristics. While PCGRL offers a unique set of affordances for game designers, it is constrained by the compute-intensive process of training RL agents, and has so far been limited to generating relatively small levels. To address this issue of scale, we implement several PCGRL environments in Jax so that all aspects of learning and simulation happen in parallel on the GPU, resulting in faster environment simulation; removing the CPU-GPU transfer of information bottleneck during RL training; and ultimately resulting in significantly improved training speed. We replicate several key results from prior works in this new framework, letting models train for much longer than previously studied, and evaluating their behavior after 1 billion timesteps. Aiming for greater control for human designers, we introduce randomized level sizes and frozen "pinpoints" of pivotal game tiles as further ways of countering overfitting. To test the generalization ability of learned generators, we evaluate models on large, out-of-distribution map sizes, and find that partial observation sizes learn more robust design strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling optical dynamic range compressors using deep neural networks with Selective State Space models. The proposed approach surpasses previous methods based on recurrent layers by employing a Selective State Space block to encode the input audio. It features a refined technique integrating Feature-wise Linear Modulation and Gated Linear Units to adjust the network dynamically, conditioning the compression's attack and release phases according to external parameters. The proposed architecture is well-suited for low-latency and real-time applications, crucial in live audio processing. The method has been validated on the analog optical compressors TubeTech CL 1B and Teletronix LA-2A, which possess distinct characteristics. Evaluation is performed using quantitative metrics and subjective listening tests, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. Results show that our black-box modeling methods outperform all others, achieving accurate emulation of the compression process for both seen and unseen settings during training. We further show a correlation between this accuracy and the sampling density of the control parameters in the dataset and identify settings with fast attack and slow release as the most challenging to emulate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya Bhatia, Dayi Lin, Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Data quality is vital in software analytics, particularly for machine learning (ML) applications like software defect prediction (SDP). Despite the widespread use of ML in software engineering, the effect of data quality antipatterns on these models remains underexplored.
  Objective: This study develops a taxonomy of ML-specific data quality antipatterns and assesses their impact on software analytics models' performance and interpretation.
  Methods: We identified eight types and 14 sub-types of ML-specific data quality antipatterns through a literature review. We conducted experiments to determine the prevalence of these antipatterns in SDP data (RQ1), assess how cleaning order affects model performance (RQ2), evaluate the impact of antipattern removal on performance (RQ3), and examine the consistency of interpretation from models built with different antipatterns (RQ4).
  Results: In our SDP case study, we identified nine antipatterns. Over 90% of these overlapped at both row and column levels, complicating cleaning prioritization and risking excessive data removal. The order of cleaning significantly impacts ML model performance, with neural networks being more resilient to cleaning order changes than simpler models like logistic regression. Antipatterns such as Tailed Distributions and Class Overlap show a statistically significant correlation with performance metrics when other antipatterns are cleaned. Models built with different antipatterns showed moderate consistency in interpretation results.
  Conclusion: The cleaning order of different antipatterns impacts ML model performance. Five antipatterns have a statistically significant correlation with model performance when others are cleaned. Additionally, model interpretation is moderately affected by different data quality antipatterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, deep learning has made remarkable strides, especially with generative modeling, such as large language models and probabilistic diffusion models. However, training these models often involves significant computational resources, requiring billions of petaFLOPs. This high resource consumption results in substantial energy usage and a large carbon footprint, raising critical environmental concerns. Back-propagation (BP) is a major source of computational expense during training deep learning models. To advance research on energy-efficient training and allow for sparse learning on any machine and device, we propose a general, energy-efficient convolution module that can be seamlessly integrated into any deep learning architecture. Specifically, we introduce channel-wise sparsity with additional gradient selection schedulers during backward based on the assumption that BP is often dense and inefficient, which can lead to over-fitting and high computational consumption. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces 40\% computations while potentially improving model performance, validated on image classification and generation tasks. This reduction can lead to significant energy savings and a lower carbon footprint during the research and development phases of large-scale AI systems. Additionally, our method mitigates over-fitting in a manner distinct from Dropout, allowing it to be combined with Dropout to further enhance model performance and reduce computational resource usage. Extensive experiments validate that our method generalizes to a variety of datasets and tasks and is compatible with a wide range of deep learning architectures and modules.

<p>Abstract: Current parking area perception algorithms primarily focus on detecting vacant slots within a limited range, relying on error-prone homographic projection for both labeling and inference. However, recent advancements in Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) require interaction with end-users through comprehensive and intelligent Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs). These interfaces should present a complete perception of the parking area going from distinguishing vacant slots' entry lines to the orientation of other parked vehicles. This paper introduces Multi-Task Fisheye Cross View Transformers (MT F-CVT), which leverages features from a four-camera fisheye Surround-view Camera System (SVCS) with multihead attentions to create a detailed Bird-Eye View (BEV) grid feature map. Features are processed by both a segmentation decoder and a Polygon-Yolo based object detection decoder for parking slots and vehicles. Trained on data labeled using LiDAR, MT F-CVT positions objects within a 25m x 25m real open-road scenes with an average error of only 20 cm. Our larger model achieves an F-1 score of 0.89. Moreover the smaller model operates at 16 fps on an Nvidia Jetson Orin embedded board, with similar detection results to the larger one. MT F-CVT demonstrates robust generalization capability across different vehicles and camera rig configurations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Kyogo Kawaguchi, Robert P. Dick, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Increase in data, size, or compute can lead to sudden learning of specific capabilities by a neural network -- a phenomenon often called "emergence". Beyond scientific understanding, establishing the causal factors underlying such emergent capabilities is crucial to enable risk regulation frameworks for AI. In this work, we seek inspiration from study of emergent properties in other fields and propose a phenomenological definition for the concept in the context of neural networks. Our definition implicates the acquisition of specific structures underlying the data-generating process as a cause of sudden performance growth for specific, narrower tasks. We empirically investigate this definition by proposing an experimental system grounded in a context-sensitive formal language and find that Transformers trained to perform tasks on top of strings from this language indeed exhibit emergent capabilities. Specifically, we show that once the language's underlying grammar and context-sensitivity inducing structures are learned by the model, performance on narrower tasks suddenly begins to improve. We then analogize our network's learning dynamics with the process of percolation on a bipartite graph, establishing a formal phase transition model that predicts the shift in the point of emergence observed in experiment when changing the data structure. Overall, our experimental and theoretical frameworks yield a step towards better defining, characterizing, and predicting emergence in neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Wang, Xiaoyan Yang, Yuqi Zhu, Yue Shen, Jian Wang, Peng Wei, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, MedPaLM-2, and Med-Gemini achieve performance competitively with human experts across various medical benchmarks. However, they still face challenges in making professional diagnoses akin to physicians, particularly in efficiently gathering patient information and reasoning the final diagnosis. To this end, we introduce the RuleAlign framework, designed to align LLMs with specific diagnostic rules. We develop a medical dialogue dataset comprising rule-based communications between patients and physicians and design an alignment learning approach through preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We hope that our work can serve as an inspiration for exploring the potential of LLMs as AI physicians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phurinut Srisawad, Juergen Branke, Long Tran-Thanh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper formulates a new Best-Arm Identification problem in the non-stationary stochastic bandits setting, where the means of all arms are shifted in the same way due to a global influence of the environment. The aim is to identify the unique best arm across environmental change given a fixed total budget. While this setting can be regarded as a special case of Adversarial Bandits or Corrupted Bandits, we demonstrate that existing solutions tailored to those settings do not fully utilise the nature of this global influence, and thus, do not work well in practice (despite their theoretical guarantees). To overcome this issue, in this paper we develop a novel selection policy that is consistent and robust in dealing with global environmental shifts. We then propose an allocation policy, LinLUCB, which exploits information about global shifts across all arms in each environment. Empirical tests depict a significant improvement in our policies against other existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present xGen-VideoSyn-1, a text-to-video (T2V) generation model capable of producing realistic scenes from textual descriptions. Building on recent advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora, we explore the latent diffusion model (LDM) architecture and introduce a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE). VidVAE compresses video data both spatially and temporally, significantly reducing the length of visual tokens and the computational demands associated with generating long-sequence videos. To further address the computational costs, we propose a divide-and-merge strategy that maintains temporal consistency across video segments. Our Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model incorporates spatial and temporal self-attention layers, enabling robust generalization across different timeframes and aspect ratios. We have devised a data processing pipeline from the very beginning and collected over 13M high-quality video-text pairs. The pipeline includes multiple steps such as clipping, text detection, motion estimation, aesthetics scoring, and dense captioning based on our in-house video-LLM model. Training the VidVAE and DiT models required approximately 40 and 642 H100 days, respectively. Our model supports over 14-second 720p video generation in an end-to-end way and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art T2V models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Tang, Weicai Ye, Yifan Wang, Di Huang, Hujun Bao, Tong He, Guofeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces. However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Ddeflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise in healthcare, demonstrating capabilities such as passing medical licensing exams and providing clinical knowledge. However, their current use as information retrieval tools is limited by challenges like data staleness, resource demands, and occasional generation of incorrect information. This study assessed the potential of LLMs to function as autonomous agents in a simulated tertiary care medical center, using real-world clinical cases across multiple specialties. Both proprietary and open-source LLMs were evaluated, with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhancing contextual relevance. Proprietary models, particularly GPT-4, generally outperformed open-source models, showing improved guideline adherence and more accurate responses with RAG. The manual evaluation by expert clinicians was crucial in validating models' outputs, underscoring the importance of human oversight in LLM operation. Further, the study emphasizes Natural Language Programming (NLP) as the appropriate paradigm for modifying model behavior, allowing for precise adjustments through tailored prompts and real-world interactions. This approach highlights the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance and supplement clinical decision-making, while also emphasizing the value of continuous expert involvement and the flexibility of NLP to ensure their reliability and effectiveness in healthcare settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Various human-designed prompt engineering techniques have been proposed to improve problem solvers based on Large Language Models (LLMs), yielding many disparate code bases. We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as computational graphs. The nodes implement functions to process multimodal data or query LLMs, and the edges describe the information flow between operations. Graphs can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies of inter-agent collaboration (where edges connect operations of different agents). Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization) and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization). Experiments demonstrate that our framework can be used to efficiently develop, integrate, and automatically improve various LLM agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavel Osinenko, Grigory Yaremenko, Georgiy Malaniya, Anton Bolychev, Alexander Gepperth</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Comparative experiments on several problems under popular baseline agents provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou, William Yeoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional belief revision frameworks often rely on the principle of minimalism, which advocates minimal changes to existing beliefs. However, research in human cognition suggests that people are inherently driven to seek explanations for inconsistencies, thereby striving for explanatory understanding rather than minimal changes when revising beliefs. Traditional frameworks often fail to account for these cognitive patterns, relying instead on formal principles that may not reflect actual human reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce Human-Aware Belief Revision, a cognitively-inspired framework for modeling human belief revision dynamics, where given a human model and an explanation for an explanandum, revises the model in a non-minimal way that aligns with human cognition. Finally, we conduct two human-subject studies to empirically evaluate our framework under real-world scenarios. Our findings support our hypotheses and provide insights into the strategies people employ when resolving inconsistencies, offering some guidance for developing more effective human-aware AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Jiang, Fei Deng, Gautam Singh, Minseung Lee, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent State Space Models (SSMs) such as S4, S5, and Mamba have shown remarkable computational benefits in long-range temporal dependency modeling. However, in many sequence modeling problems, the underlying process is inherently modular and it is of interest to have inductive biases that mimic this modular structure. In this paper, we introduce SlotSSMs, a novel framework for incorporating independent mechanisms into SSMs to preserve or encourage separation of information. Unlike conventional SSMs that maintain a monolithic state vector, SlotSSMs maintains the state as a collection of multiple vectors called slots. Crucially, the state transitions are performed independently per slot with sparse interactions across slots implemented via the bottleneck of self-attention. In experiments, we evaluate our model in object-centric video understanding, 3D visual reasoning, and video prediction tasks, which involve modeling multiple objects and their long-range temporal dependencies. We find that our proposed design offers substantial performance gains over existing sequence modeling methods. Project page is available at https://slotssms.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: This survey explores the burgeoning field of role-playing with language models, focusing on their development from early persona-based models to advanced character-driven simulations facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Initially confined to simple persona consistency due to limited model capabilities, role-playing tasks have now expanded to embrace complex character portrayals involving character consistency, behavioral alignment, and overall attractiveness. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the critical components in designing these systems, including data, models and alignment, agent architecture and evaluation. This survey not only outlines the current methodologies and challenges, such as managing dynamic personal profiles and achieving high-level persona consistency but also suggests avenues for future research in improving the depth and realism of role-playing applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheonsu Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to improve knowledge-based question-answering (QA) systems by overcoming the limitations of existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and implementing an advanced RAG system based on Graph technology to develop high-quality generative AI services. While existing RAG models demonstrate high accuracy and fluency by utilizing retrieved information, they may suffer from accuracy degradation as they generate responses using pre-loaded knowledge without reprocessing. Additionally, they cannot incorporate real-time data after the RAG configuration stage, leading to issues with contextual understanding and biased information. To address these limitations, this study implemented an enhanced RAG system utilizing Graph technology. This system is designed to efficiently search and utilize information. Specifically, it employs LangGraph to evaluate the reliability of retrieved information and synthesizes diverse data to generate more accurate and enhanced responses. Furthermore, the study provides a detailed explanation of the system's operation, key implementation steps, and examples through implementation code and validation results, thereby enhancing the understanding of advanced RAG technology. This approach offers practical guidelines for implementing advanced RAG systems in corporate services, making it a valuable resource for practical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Jin, Yifan Song, Dong Kan, Haojia Zhu, Xiangguo Sun, Zhicheng Li, Xigang Sun, Jinghui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks. However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains challenging. Previous work often neglects the spatial structures and functional layouts between entities, limiting their ability to capture transferable knowledge across regions. Further, these methods struggle to adapt effectively to specific downstream tasks, as they do not adequately address the unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a $\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion $\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$) for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban region graph that integrates detailed spatial entity data for more effective urban region representation. Then, we develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of interactions among entities. To further enhance the adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks, we design two graph-based prompting methods to incorporate explicit/hidden task knowledge. Extensive experiments on various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the superior performance of our GURPP framework. We wil release code and data upon paper notification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Daniel Gei{\ss}ler, Mengxi Liu, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread integration of ambient light sensors (ALS) in smart devices commonly used for screen brightness adaptation, their application in human activity recognition (HAR), primarily through body-worn ALS, is largely unexplored. In this work, we developed ALS-HAR, a robust wearable light-based motion activity classifier. Although ALS-HAR achieves comparable accuracy to other modalities, its natural sensitivity to external disturbances, such as changes in ambient light, weather conditions, or indoor lighting, makes it challenging for daily use. To address such drawbacks, we introduce strategies to enhance environment-invariant IMU-based activity classifications through augmented multi-modal and contrastive classifications by transferring the knowledge extracted from the ALS. Our experiments on a real-world activity dataset for three different scenarios demonstrate that while ALS-HAR's accuracy strongly relies on external lighting conditions, cross-modal information can still improve other HAR systems, such as IMU-based classifiers.Even in scenarios where ALS performs insufficiently, the additional knowledge enables improved accuracy and macro F1 score by up to 4.2 % and 6.4 %, respectively, for IMU-based classifiers and even surpasses multi-modal sensor fusion models in two of our three experiment scenarios. Our research highlights the untapped potential of ALS integration in advancing sensor-based HAR technology, paving the way for practical and efficient wearable ALS-based activity recognition systems with potential applications in healthcare, sports monitoring, and smart indoor environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiming Xie, Hong Chen, Fred Yu, Zeye Sun, Xiuyu Wu, Yingfan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from human preference is a paradigm used in large-scale language model (LLM) fine-tuning step to better align pretrained LLM to human preference for downstream task. In the past it uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to optimize the LLM policy to align with these preferences and not to draft too far from the original model. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed to solve the alignment problem with a simplified RL-free method. Using preference pairs of chosen and reject data, DPO models the relative log probability as implicit reward function and optimize LLM policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective directly. DPO is quite straight forward and easy to be understood. It perform efficiently and well in most cases. In this article, we analyze the working mechanism of $\beta$ in DPO, disclose its syntax difference between RL algorithm and DPO, and understand the potential shortage brought by the DPO simplification. With these insights, we propose MinorDPO, which is better aligned to the original RL algorithm, and increase the stability of preference optimization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avrim Blum, Kevin Stangl</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple fairness constraints have been proposed in the literature, motivated by a range of concerns about how demographic groups might be treated unfairly by machine learning classifiers. In this work we consider a different motivation; learning from biased training data. We posit several ways in which training data may be biased, including having a more noisy or negatively biased labeling process on members of a disadvantaged group, or a decreased prevalence of positive or negative examples from the disadvantaged group, or both.
  Given such biased training data, Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) may produce a classifier that not only is biased but also has suboptimal accuracy on the true data distribution. We examine the ability of fairness-constrained ERM to correct this problem. In particular, we find that the Equal Opportunity fairness constraint (Hardt, Price, and Srebro 2016) combined with ERM will provably recover the Bayes Optimal Classifier under a range of bias models. We also consider other recovery methods including reweighting the training data, Equalized Odds, and Demographic Parity. These theoretical results provide additional motivation for considering fairness interventions even if an actor cares primarily about accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourabh Balgi, Jose M. Pe\~na, Adel Daoud</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding in observational studies using copulas and normalizing flows. Using the idea of interventional equivalence of structural causal models, we develop $\rho$-GNF ($\rho$-graphical normalizing flow), where $\rho{\in}[-1,+1]$ is a bounded sensitivity parameter. This parameter represents the back-door non-causal association due to unobserved confounding, and which is encoded with a Gaussian copula. In other words, the $\rho$-GNF enables scholars to estimate the average causal effect (ACE) as a function of $\rho$, while accounting for various assumed strengths of the unobserved confounding. The output of the $\rho$-GNF is what we denote as the $\rho_{curve}$ that provides the bounds for the ACE given an interval of assumed $\rho$ values. In particular, the $\rho_{curve}$ enables scholars to identify the confounding strength required to nullify the ACE, similar to other sensitivity analysis methods (e.g., the E-value). Leveraging on experiments from simulated and real-world data, we show the benefits of $\rho$-GNF. One benefit is that the $\rho$-GNF uses a Gaussian copula to encode the distribution of the unobserved causes, which is commonly used in many applied settings. This distributional assumption produces narrower ACE bounds compared to other popular sensitivity analysis methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, much work has been done on processing of wireless spectrum data involving machine learning techniques in domain-related problems for cognitive radio networks, such as anomaly detection, modulation classification, technology classification and device fingerprinting. Most of the solutions are based on labeled data, created in a controlled manner and processed with supervised learning approaches. However, spectrum data measured in real-world environment is highly nondeterministic, making its labeling a laborious and expensive process, requiring domain expertise, thus being one of the main drawbacks of using supervised learning approaches in this domain. In this paper, we investigate the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for exploring spectrum activities in a real-world unlabeled data. In particular, we compare the performance of two SSL models, one based on a reference DeepCluster architecture and one adapted for spectrum activity identification and clustering, and a baseline model based on K-means clustering algorithm. We show that SSL models achieve superior performance regarding the quality of extracted features and clustering performance. With SSL models we achieve reduction of the feature vectors size by two orders of magnitude, while improving the performance by a factor of 2 to 2.5 across the evaluation metrics, supported by visual assessment. Additionally we show that adaptation of the reference SSL architecture to the domain data provides reduction of model complexity by one order of magnitude, while preserving or even improving the clustering performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikuan Li, Chengsheng Mao, Kaixuan Huang, Hanyin Wang, Zheng Yu, Mengdi Wang, Yuan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Scarcity of health care resources could result in the unavoidable consequence of rationing. For example, ventilators are often limited in supply, especially during public health emergencies or in resource-constrained health care settings, such as amid the pandemic of COVID-19. Currently, there is no universally accepted standard for health care resource allocation protocols, resulting in different governments prioritizing patients based on various criteria and heuristic-based protocols. In this study, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning for critical care resource allocation policy optimization to fairly and effectively ration resources. We propose a transformer-based deep Q-network to integrate the disease progression of individual patients and the interaction effects among patients during the critical care resource allocation. We aim to improve both fairness of allocation and overall patient outcomes. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces excess deaths and achieves a more equitable distribution under different levels of ventilator shortage, when compared to existing severity-based and comorbidity-based methods in use by different governments. Our source code is included in the supplement and will be released on Github upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Ju, Xingrun Xing, Zhixiong Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Locate-Then-Edit paradigm has emerged as one of the main approaches in changing factual knowledge stored in the Language models. However, there is a lack of research on whether present locating methods can pinpoint the exact parameters embedding the desired knowledge. Moreover, although many researchers have questioned the validity of locality hypothesis of factual knowledge, no method is provided to test the a hypothesis for more in-depth discussion and research. Therefore, we introduce KLoB, a benchmark examining three essential properties that a reliable knowledge locating method should satisfy. KLoB can serve as a benchmark for evaluating existing locating methods in language models, and can contributes a method to reassessing the validity of locality hypothesis of factual knowledge. KLoB is publicly available at an anonymous GitHub: \url{https://github.com/anon6662/KLoB}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiakai Wang, Xianglong Liu, Jin Hu, Donghua Wang, Siyang Wu, Tingsong Jiang, Yuanfang Guo, Aishan Liu, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated high vulnerability to adversarial examples, raising broad security concerns about their applications. Besides the attacks in the digital world, the practical implications of adversarial examples in the physical world present significant challenges and safety concerns. However, current research on physical adversarial examples (PAEs) lacks a comprehensive understanding of their unique characteristics, leading to limited significance and understanding. In this paper, we address this gap by thoroughly examining the characteristics of PAEs within a practical workflow encompassing training, manufacturing, and re-sampling processes. By analyzing the links between physical adversarial attacks, we identify manufacturing and re-sampling as the primary sources of distinct attributes and particularities in PAEs. Leveraging this knowledge, we develop a comprehensive analysis and classification framework for PAEs based on their specific characteristics, covering over 100 studies on physical-world adversarial examples. Furthermore, we investigate defense strategies against PAEs and identify open challenges and opportunities for future research. We aim to provide a fresh, thorough, and systematic understanding of PAEs, thereby promoting the development of robust adversarial learning and its application in open-world scenarios to provide the community with a continuously updated list of physical world adversarial sample resources, including papers, code, \etc, within the proposed framework</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Ayoobi, Nico Potyka, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose ProtoArgNet, a novel interpretable deep neural architecture for image classification in the spirit of prototypical-part-learning as found, e.g., in ProtoPNet. While earlier approaches associate every class with multiple prototypical-parts, ProtoArgNet uses super-prototypes that combine prototypical-parts into a unified class representation. This is done by combining local activations of prototypes in an MLP-like manner, enabling the localization of prototypes and learning (non-linear) spatial relationships among them. By leveraging a form of argumentation, ProtoArgNet is capable of providing both supporting (i.e. `this looks like that') and attacking (i.e. `this differs from that') explanations. We demonstrate on several datasets that ProtoArgNet outperforms state-of-the-art prototypical-part-learning approaches. Moreover, the argumentation component in ProtoArgNet is customisable to the user's cognitive requirements by a process of sparsification, which leads to more compact explanations compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Snyder, Marius Moisescu, Muhammad Bilal Zafar</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have taken great strides towards helping humans with a plethora of tasks, hallucinations remain a major impediment towards gaining user trust. The fluency and coherence of model generations even when hallucinating makes detection a difficult task. In this work, we explore if the artifacts associated with the model generations can provide hints that the generation will contain hallucinations. Specifically, we probe LLMs at 1) the inputs via Integrated Gradients based token attribution, 2) the outputs via the Softmax probabilities, and 3) the internal state via self-attention and fully-connected layer activations for signs of hallucinations on open-ended question answering tasks. Our results show that the distributions of these artifacts tend to differ between hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations. Building on this insight, we train binary classifiers that use these artifacts as input features to classify model generations into hallucinations and non-hallucinations. These hallucination classifiers achieve up to $0.80$ AUROC. We also show that tokens preceding a hallucination can already predict the subsequent hallucination even before it occurs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongwhan Choi, Hyowon Wi, Chaejeong Lee, Sung-Bae Cho, Dongha Lee, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising technique for improving recommender systems, addressing the challenge of data sparsity by using self-supervised signals from raw data. Integration of CL with graph convolutional network (GCN)-based collaborative filterings (CFs) has been explored in recommender systems. However, current CL-based recommendation models heavily rely on low-pass filters and graph augmentations. In this paper, inspired by the reaction-diffusion equation, we propose a novel CL method for recommender systems called the reaction-diffusion graph contrastive learning model (RDGCL). We design our own GCN for CF based on the equations of diffusion, i.e., low-pass filter, and reaction, i.e., high-pass filter. Our proposed CL-based training occurs between reaction and diffusion-based embeddings, so there is no need for graph augmentations. Experimental evaluation on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CL-based recommendation models. By enhancing recommendation accuracy and diversity, our method brings an advancement in CL for recommender systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius-Constantin Dinu, Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei, Markus Holzleitner, Werner Zellinger, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SymbolicAI, a versatile and modular framework employing a logic-based approach to concept learning and flow management in generative processes. SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for multi-modal data that connects multi-step generative processes and aligns their outputs with user objectives in complex workflows. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models with in-context learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems. Through these operations based on in-context learning our framework enables the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs. Finally, we introduce a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows. We refer to the empirical score as the "Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity", or VERTEX score for short. The framework codebase and benchmark are linked below.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonho Lee, Michelle S. Lam, Helena Vasconcelos, Michael S. Bernstein, Chelsea Finn</p>
<p>Abstract: The standard way to teach models is by feeding them lots of data. However, this approach often teaches models incorrect ideas because they pick up on misleading signals in the data. To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Prior methods incorporate additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for misleading features or additional labels for debiased data. However, such strategies require a large amount of labeler effort. We hypothesize that people are good at providing textual feedback at the concept level, a capability that existing teaching frameworks do not leverage. We propose Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description of a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process. Clarify is the first end-to-end system for user model correction. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, leading to increased worst-case performance in two datasets. We additionally conduct a case study on a large-scale image dataset, ImageNet, using Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichuan Mo, Yuji Wang, Zeming Wei, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly with a particular focus on harmful content filtering or heuristical defensive prompt designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through the prompts remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0 while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task. The proposed defense strategy incurs only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Schoenegger, Peter S. Park, Ezra Karger, Sean Trott, Philip E. Tetlock</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) match and sometimes exceeding human performance in many domains. This study explores the potential of LLMs to augment human judgement in a forecasting task. We evaluate the effect on human forecasters of two LLM assistants: one designed to provide high-quality ("superforecasting") advice, and the other designed to be overconfident and base-rate neglecting, thus providing noisy forecasting advice. We compare participants using these assistants to a control group that received a less advanced model that did not provide numerical predictions or engaged in explicit discussion of predictions. Participants (N = 991) answered a set of six forecasting questions and had the option to consult their assigned LLM assistant throughout. Our preregistered analyses show that interacting with each of our frontier LLM assistants significantly enhances prediction accuracy by between 24 percent and 28 percent compared to the control group. Exploratory analyses showed a pronounced outlier effect in one forecasting item, without which we find that the superforecasting assistant increased accuracy by 41 percent, compared with 29 percent for the noisy assistant. We further examine whether LLM forecasting augmentation disproportionately benefits less skilled forecasters, degrades the wisdom-of-the-crowd by reducing prediction diversity, or varies in effectiveness with question difficulty. Our data do not consistently support these hypotheses. Our results suggest that access to a frontier LLM assistant, even a noisy one, can be a helpful decision aid in cognitively demanding tasks compared to a less powerful model that does not provide specific forecasting advice. However, the effects of outliers suggest that further research into the robustness of this pattern is needed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woo Kyung Kim, Minjong Yoo, Honguk Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown considerable promise, especially in solving long-horizon tasks via hierarchical structures. These skills, learned task-agnostically from offline datasets, can accelerate the policy learning process for new tasks. Yet, the application of these skills in different domains remains restricted due to their inherent dependency on the datasets, which poses a challenge when attempting to learn a skill-based policy via RL for a target domain different from the datasets' domains. In this paper, we present a novel offline skill learning framework DuSkill which employs a guided Diffusion model to generate versatile skills extended from the limited skills in datasets, thereby enhancing the robustness of policy learning for tasks in different domains. Specifically, we devise a guided diffusion-based skill decoder in conjunction with the hierarchical encoding to disentangle the skill embedding space into two distinct representations, one for encapsulating domain-invariant behaviors and the other for delineating the factors that induce domain variations in the behaviors. Our DuSkill framework enhances the diversity of skills learned offline, thus enabling to accelerate the learning procedure of high-level policies for different domains. Through experiments, we show that DuSkill outperforms other skill-based imitation learning and RL algorithms for several long-horizon tasks, demonstrating its benefits in few-shot imitation and online RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently gained immense popularity. Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT-4V and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Casper, Lennart Schulze, Oam Patel, Dylan Hadfield-Menell</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers, AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is so large -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may elicit harmful behaviors. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to improve robustness, however, they empirically struggle to fix failure modes that differ from the attacks used during training. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are or using inputs that elicit them. LAT makes use of the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. Here, we use it to defend against failure modes without examples that elicit them. Specifically, we use LAT to remove trojans and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness to novel attacks and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.</p>

This paper presents Larimar - a novel, brain-inspired architecture for enhancing LLMs with a distributed episodic memory. Larimar's memory allows for dynamic, one-shot updates of knowledge without the need for computationally expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Experimental results on multiple fact editing benchmarks demonstrate that Larimar attains accuracy comparable to most competitive baselines, even in the challenging sequential editing setup, but also excels in speed - yielding speed-ups of 8-10x depending on the base LLM - as well as flexibility due to the proposed architecture being simple, LLM-agnostic, and hence general. We further provide mechanisms for selective fact forgetting, information leakage prevention, and input context length generalization with Larimar and show their effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee, Yinan Yu, Robert Feldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence but often lack performance when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, a common scenario due to the inevitable domain shifts in real-world applications. This limitation stems from the common assumption that training and testing data share the same distribution--an assumption frequently violated in practice. Despite their effectiveness with large amounts of data and computational power, DNNs struggle with distributional shifts and limited labeled data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization across various tasks and domains. Meta-learning presents a promising approach by employing algorithms that acquire transferable knowledge across various tasks for fast adaptation, eliminating the need to learn each task from scratch. This survey paper delves into the realm of meta-learning with a focus on its contribution to domain generalization. We first clarify the concept of meta-learning for domain generalization and introduce a novel taxonomy based on the feature extraction strategy and the classifier learning methodology, offering a granular view of methodologies. Additionally, we present a decision graph to assist readers in navigating the taxonomy based on data availability and domain shifts, enabling them to select and develop a proper model tailored to their specific problem requirements. Through an exhaustive review of existing methods and underlying theories, we map out the fundamentals of the field. Our survey provides practical insights and an informed discussion on promising research directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models on most of today's NLP tasks and benchmarks. Yet, the community is only slowly adopting these models for text embedding tasks, which require rich contextualized representations. In this work, we introduce LLM2Vec, a simple unsupervised approach that can transform any decoder-only LLM into a strong text encoder. LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 4 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 8B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data (as of May 24, 2024). Our strong empirical results and extensive analysis demonstrate that LLMs can be effectively transformed into universal text encoders in a parameter-efficient manner without the need for expensive adaptation or synthetic GPT-4 generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as stance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongxiao Xu, Canyu Chen, Yueqing Liang, Baixiang Huang, Guangji Bai, Liang Zhao, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in time series forecasting, existing forecasters often overlook the heterogeneity between long-range and short-range time series, leading to performance degradation in practical applications. In this work, we highlight the need of distinct objectives tailored to different ranges. We point out that time series can be decomposed into global patterns and local variations, which should be addressed separately in long- and short-range time series. To meet the objectives, we propose a multi-scale hybrid Mamba-Transformer experts model State Space Transformer (SST). SST leverages Mamba as an expert to extract global patterns in coarse-grained long-range time series, and Local Window Transformer (LWT), the other expert to focus on capturing local variations in fine-grained short-range time series. With an input-dependent mechanism, State Space Model (SSM)-based Mamba is able to selectively retain long-term patterns and filter out fluctuations, while LWT employs a local window to enhance locality-awareness capability, thus effectively capturing local variations. To adaptively integrate the global patterns and local variations, a long-short router dynamically adjusts contributions of the two experts. SST achieves superior performance with scaling linearly $O(L)$ on time series length $L$. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the SST can achieve SOTA results in long-short range time series forecasting while maintaining low memory footprint and computational cost.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Bird's Eye View (BEV) fusion for map construction have demonstrated remarkable mapping of urban environments. However, their deep and bulky architecture incurs substantial amounts of backpropagation memory and computing latency. Consequently, the problem poses an unavoidable bottleneck in constructing high-resolution (HR) BEV maps, as their large-sized features cause significant increases in costs including GPU memory consumption and computing latency, named diverging training costs issue. Affected by the problem, most existing methods adopt low-resolution (LR) BEV and struggle to estimate the precise locations of urban scene components like road lanes, and sidewalks. As the imprecision leads to risky motion planning like collision avoidance, the diverging training costs issue has to be resolved. In this paper, we address the issue with our novel BEVRestore mechanism. Specifically, our proposed model encodes the features of each sensor to LR BEV space and restores them to HR space to establish a memory-efficient map constructor. To this end, we introduce the BEV restoration strategy, which restores aliasing, and blocky artifacts of the up-scaled BEV features, and narrows down the width of the labels. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed mechanism provides a plug-and-play, memory-efficient pipeline, enabling an HR map construction with a broad BEV scope.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog electronic circuits are at the core of an important category of musical devices. The nonlinear features of their electronic components give analog musical devices a distinctive timbre and sound quality, making them highly desirable. Artificial neural networks have rapidly gained popularity for the emulation of analog audio effects circuits, particularly recurrent networks. While neural approaches have been successful in accurately modeling distortion circuits, they require architectural improvements that account for parameter conditioning and low latency response. In this article, we explore the application of recent machine learning advancements for virtual analog modeling. We compare State Space models and Linear Recurrent Units against the more common Long Short Term Memory networks. These have shown promising ability in sequence to sequence modeling tasks, showing a notable improvement in signal history encoding. Our comparative study uses these black box neural modeling techniques with a variety of audio effects. We evaluate the performance and limitations using multiple metrics aiming to assess the models' ability to accurately replicate energy envelopes, frequency contents, and transients in the audio signal. To incorporate control parameters we employ the Feature wise Linear Modulation method. Long Short Term Memory networks exhibit better accuracy in emulating distortions and equalizers, while the State Space model, followed by Long Short Term Memory networks when integrated in an encoder decoder structure, outperforms others in emulating saturation and compression. When considering long time variant characteristics, the State Space model demonstrates the greatest accuracy. The Long Short Term Memory and, in particular, Linear Recurrent Unit networks present more tendency to introduce audio artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Chen, Rongpeng Li, Xiaoxue Yu, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in edge computing environments is critical for enhancing privacy and computational efficiency. Toward efficient wireless LLM inference in edge computing, this study comprehensively analyzes the impact of different splitting points in mainstream open-source LLMs. On this basis, this study introduces a framework taking inspiration from model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to determine the optimal splitting point across the edge and user equipment (UE). By incorporating a reward surrogate model, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of frequent performance evaluations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this method effectively balances inference performance and computational load under varying network conditions, providing a robust solution for LLM deployment in decentralized settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Qin, Zheyu Yan, Zixuan Pan, Wujie Wen, Xiaobo Sharon Hu, Yiyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators using non-volatile memory (NVM) devices offer promising solutions for energy-efficient and low-latency Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference execution. However, practical deployment is often hindered by the challenge of dealing with the massive amount of model weight parameters impacted by the inherent device variations within non-volatile computing-in-memory (NVCIM) accelerators. This issue significantly offsets their advantages by increasing training overhead, the time and energy needed for mapping weights to device states, and diminishing inference accuracy. To mitigate these challenges, we propose the "Tiny Shared Block (TSB)" method, which integrates a small shared 1x1 convolution block into the DNN architecture. This block is designed to stabilize feature processing across the network, effectively reducing the impact of device variation. Extensive experimental results show that TSB achieves over 20x inference accuracy gap improvement, over 5x training speedup, and weights-to-device mapping cost reduction while requiring less than 0.4% of the original weights to be write-verified during programming, when compared with state-of-the-art baseline solutions. Our approach provides a practical and efficient solution for deploying robust DNN models on NVCIM accelerators, making it a valuable contribution to the field of energy-efficient AI hardware.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various fields, the efficiency of training and inference remains a major challenge. To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192. Our code is available at https://github.com/XiaoMi/subllm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Zhichun Guo, Kaiwen Dong, Xiaobao Huang, Bozhao Nan, Roshni Iyer, Xiangliang Zhang, Olaf Wiest, Wei Wang, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with their strong task-handling capabilities have shown remarkable advancements across a spectrum of fields, moving beyond natural language understanding. However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. Moreover, a handcrafted molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across 4 downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM, while only introducing a small number of trainable parameters 0.53% and 0.82%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayaram Raghuram, George Kesidis, David J. Miller</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor data poisoning, inserted within instruction examples used to fine-tune a foundation Large Language Model (LLM) for downstream tasks (\textit{e.g.,} sentiment prediction), is a serious security concern due to the evasive nature of such attacks. The poisoning is usually in the form of a (seemingly innocuous) trigger word or phrase inserted into a very small fraction of the fine-tuning samples from a target class. Such backdoor attacks can: alter response sentiment, violate censorship, over-refuse (invoke censorship for legitimate queries), inject false content, or trigger nonsense responses (hallucinations). In this work we investigate the efficacy of instruction fine-tuning backdoor attacks as attack "hyperparameters" are varied under a variety of scenarios, considering: the trigger location in the poisoned examples; robustness to change in the trigger location, partial triggers, and synonym substitutions at test time; attack transfer from one (fine-tuning) domain to a related test domain; and clean-label vs. dirty-label poisoning. Based on our observations, we propose and evaluate two defenses against these attacks: i) a \textit{during-fine-tuning defense} based on word-frequency counts that assumes the (possibly poisoned) fine-tuning dataset is available and identifies the backdoor trigger tokens; and ii) a \textit{post-fine-tuning defense} based on downstream clean fine-tuning of the backdoored LLM with a small defense dataset. Finally, we provide a brief survey of related work on backdoor attacks and defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Yao, Jiangkun Yang, Yongqiang He, Jia Liu, Weiping Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech recognition is an essential start ring of human-computer interaction, and recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent success in this task. However, when the model training and private data provider are always separated, some security threats that make deep neural networks (DNNs) abnormal deserve to be researched. In recent years, the typical backdoor attacks have been researched in speech recognition systems. The existing backdoor methods are based on data poisoning. The attacker adds some incorporated changes to benign speech spectrograms or changes the speech components, such as pitch and timbre. As a result, the poisoned data can be detected by human hearing or automatic deep algorithms. To improve the stealthiness of data poisoning, we propose a non-neural and fast algorithm called Random Spectrogram Rhythm Transformation (RSRT) in this paper. The algorithm combines four steps to generate stealthy poisoned utterances. From the perspective of rhythm component transformation, our proposed trigger stretches or squeezes the mel spectrograms and recovers them back to signals. The operation keeps timbre and content unchanged for good stealthiness. Our experiments are conducted on two kinds of speech recognition tasks, including testing the stealthiness of poisoned samples by speaker verification and automatic speech recognition. The results show that our method has excellent effectiveness and stealthiness. The rhythm trigger needs a low poisoning rate and gets a very high attack success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoichi Ishizuka, Takashi Imai, Kaoru Kawamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method of model-based time series clustering with mixtures of general state space models (MSSMs). Each component of MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method is that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific time series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of the MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of variational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an arbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as a variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging to the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an additional penalty term called entropy annealing. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first computationally feasible one for time series clustering based on general (possibly nonlinear, non-Gaussian) state space models. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is effective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of clusters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weimin Wu, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of latent \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformers (\textbf{DiT}s) under the low-dimensional linear latent space assumption. Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one. Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error. Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the convergence rate and the computational efficiency are both dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhay Sheshadri, Aidan Ewart, Phillip Guo, Aengus Lynch, Cindy Wu, Vivek Hebbar, Henry Sleight, Asa Cooper Stickland, Ethan Perez, Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Stephen Casper</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sparsh Gupta, Debanjan Konar, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-local operations play a crucial role in computer vision enabling the capture of long-range dependencies through weighted sums of features across the input, surpassing the constraints of traditional convolution operations that focus solely on local neighborhoods. Non-local operations typically require computing pairwise relationships between all elements in a set, leading to quadratic complexity in terms of time and memory. Due to the high computational and memory demands, scaling non-local neural networks to large-scale problems can be challenging. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical scalable non-local neural network, referred to as Quantum Non-Local Neural Network (QNL-Net), to enhance pattern recognition. The proposed QNL-Net relies on inherent quantum parallelism to allow the simultaneous processing of a large number of input features enabling more efficient computations in quantum-enhanced feature space and involving pairwise relationships through quantum entanglement. We benchmark our proposed QNL-Net with other quantum counterparts to binary classification with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. The simulation findings showcase our QNL-Net achieves cutting-edge accuracy levels in binary image classification among quantum classifiers while utilizing fewer qubits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juseung Yun, Yi Hu, Jinhyung Kim, Jongseong Jang, Soonyoung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce EXAONEPath, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. EXAONEPath is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs. Our experiments demonstrate that EXAONEPath significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared EXAONEPath with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that EXAONEPath achieves superior performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Dong, Hanxue Gu, Yaqian Chen, Jichen Yang, Yuwen Chen, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention because of its ability to segment various objects in images given a prompt. The recently developed SAM 2 has extended this ability to video inputs. This opens an opportunity to apply SAM to 3D images, one of the fundamental tasks in the medical imaging field. In this paper, we extensively evaluate SAM 2's ability to segment both 2D and 3D medical images by first collecting 21 medical imaging datasets, including surgical videos, common 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound. Two evaluation settings of SAM 2 are considered: (1) multi-frame 3D segmentation, where prompts are provided to one or multiple slice(s) selected from the volume, and (2) single-frame 2D segmentation, where prompts are provided to each slice. The former only applies to videos and 3D modalities, while the latter applies to all datasets. Our results show that SAM 2 exhibits similar performance as SAM under single-frame 2D segmentation, and has variable performance under multi-frame 3D segmentation depending on the choices of slices to annotate, the direction of the propagation, the predictions utilized during the propagation, etc. We believe our work enhances the understanding of SAM 2's behavior in the medical field and provides directions for future work in adapting SAM 2 to this domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruifeng Li, Mingqian Li, Wei Liu, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective molecular representation learning is crucial for advancing molecular property prediction and drug design. Mainstream molecular representation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges: insufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitations such as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fitting capabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. By incorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation of molecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant called SwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as the core of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computational efficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on the strengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmented variant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs into GNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning. Experiments across 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: As one of the most representative DL techniques, Transformer architecture has empowered numerous advanced models, especially the large language models (LLMs) that comprise billions of parameters, becoming a cornerstone in deep learning. Despite the impressive achievements, Transformers still face inherent limitations, particularly the time-consuming inference resulting from the quadratic computation complexity of attention calculation. Recently, a novel architecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models, delivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving near-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an increasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve impressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution, there is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing Mamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging model architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth investigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering three main aspects: the advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to diverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we first review the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning models and the details of Mamba-1&2 as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the significance of Mamba for AI, we comprehensively review the related studies focusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and applications. Finally, we present a discussion of current limitations and explore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for future investigations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haifeng Ruan, Yuntong Zhang, Abhik Roychoudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous program improvement typically involves automatically producing bug fixes and feature additions. Such program improvement can be accomplished by a combination of large language model (LLM) and program analysis capabilities, in the form of an LLM agent. Since program repair or program improvement typically requires a specification of intended behavior - specification inference can be useful for producing high quality program patches. In this work, we examine efficient and low-cost workflows for iterative specification inference within an LLM agent. Given a GitHub issue to be resolved in a software project, our goal is to conduct iterative code search accompanied by specification inference - thereby inferring intent from both the project structure and behavior. The intent thus captured is examined by a reviewer agent with the goal of vetting the patches as well as providing a measure of confidence in the vetted patches. Our approach SpecRover (AutoCodeRover-v2) is built on the open-source LLM agent AutoCodeRover. In an evaluation on the full SWE-Bench consisting of 2294 GitHub issues, it shows more than 50% improvement in efficacy over AutoCodeRover. Compared to the open-source agents available, our work shows modest cost ($0.65 per issue) in resolving an average GitHub issue in SWE-Bench lite. The production of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better "signal" to be given to the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with confidence. SpecRover also seeks to demonstrate the continued importance of specification inference in automated program repair, even as program repair technologies enter the LLM era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khanh Nguyen, Huy Hoang Nguyen, Egor Panfilov, Aleksei Tiulpin</p>
<p>Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, which has no cure. Knee OA (KOA) is one of the highest causes of disability worldwide, and it costs billions of United States dollars to the global community. Prediction of KOA progression has been of high interest to the community for years, as it can advance treatment development through more efficient clinical trials and improve patient outcomes through more efficient healthcare utilization. Existing approaches for predicting KOA, however, are predominantly static, i.e. consider data from a single time point to predict progression many years into the future, and knee level, i.e. consider progression in a single joint only. Due to these and related reasons, these methods fail to deliver the level of predictive performance, which is sufficient to result in cost savings and better patient outcomes. Collecting extensive data from all patients on a regular basis could address the issue, but it is limited by the high cost at a population level. In this work, we propose to go beyond static prediction models in OA, and bring a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach, designed to dynamically follow up patients with the objective of maximizing the number of informative data acquisitions, while minimizing their total cost over a period of time. Our approach is based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and it leverages a novel reward function designed specifically for AS of disease progression in more than one part of a human body. Our method is end-to-end, relies on multi-modal Deep Learning, and requires no human input at inference time. Throughout an exhaustive experimental evaluation, we show that using RL can provide a higher monetary benefit when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zebin Yao, Fangxiang Feng, Ruifan Li, Xiaojie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The customization of text-to-image models has seen significant advancements, yet generating multiple personalized concepts remains a challenging task. Current methods struggle with attribute leakage and layout confusion when handling multiple concepts, leading to reduced concept fidelity and semantic consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free framework, Concept Conductor, designed to ensure visual fidelity and correct layout in multi-concept customization. Concept Conductor isolates the sampling processes of multiple custom models to prevent attribute leakage between different concepts and corrects erroneous layouts through self-attention-based spatial guidance. Additionally, we present a concept injection technique that employs shape-aware masks to specify the generation area for each concept. This technique injects the structure and appearance of personalized concepts through feature fusion in the attention layers, ensuring harmony in the final image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Concept Conductor can consistently generate composite images with accurate layouts while preserving the visual details of each concept. Compared to existing baselines, Concept Conductor shows significant performance improvements. Our method supports the combination of any number of concepts and maintains high fidelity even when dealing with visually similar concepts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingrui Hou, Axel Finke, Georgina Cosma</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of machine unlearning within neural information retrieval, termed Neural Machine UnRanking (NuMuR) for short. Many of the mainstream task- or model-agnostic approaches for machine unlearning were designed for classification tasks. First, we demonstrate that these methods perform poorly on NuMuR tasks due to the unique challenges posed by neural information retrieval. Then, we develop a methodology for NuMuR named Contrastive and Consistent Loss (CoCoL), which effectively balances the objectives of data forgetting and model performance retention. Experimental results demonstrate that CoCoL facilitates more effective and controllable data removal than existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongjie Li, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Zhendong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Large code models (LCMs), pre-trained on vast code corpora, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide array of code-related tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a vital role in aligning these models with specific requirements and enhancing their performance in particular domains. However, synthesizing high-quality SFT datasets poses a significant challenge due to the uneven quality of datasets and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets.
  Inspired by APIs as high-level abstractions of code that encapsulate rich semantic information in a concise structure, we propose DataScope, an API-guided dataset synthesis framework designed to enhance the SFT process for LCMs in both general and domain-specific scenarios. DataScope comprises two main components: Dsel and Dgen. On one hand, Dsel employs API coverage as a core metric, enabling efficient dataset synthesis in general scenarios by selecting subsets of existing (uneven-quality) datasets with higher API coverage. On the other hand, Dgen recasts domain dataset synthesis as a process of using API-specified high-level functionality and deliberately-constituted code skeletons to synthesize concrete code.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate DataScope's effectiveness, with models fine-tuned on its synthesized datasets outperforming those tuned on unoptimized datasets five times larger. Furthermore, a series of analyses on model internals, relevant hyperparameters, and case studies provide additional evidence for the efficacy of our proposed methods. These findings underscore the significance of dataset quality in SFT and advance the field of LCMs by providing an efficient, cost-effective framework for constructing high-quality datasets. This contribution enhances performance across both general and domain-specific scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and tailored LCMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Zhao, Kejiang Chen, Xiaojian Yuan, Weiming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, research indicates that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries can induce the generation of harmful content through meticulously crafted prompts. This vulnerability poses significant challenges to the secure use and promotion of LLMs. Existing defense methods offer protection from different perspectives but often suffer from insufficient effectiveness or a significant impact on the model's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and easy-to-deploy jailbreak defense framework, namely Prefix Guidance (PG), which guides the model to identify harmful prompts by directly setting the first few tokens of the model's output. This approach combines the model's inherent security capabilities with an external classifier to defend against jailbreak attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PG across three models and five attack methods. Compared to baselines, our approach is generally more effective on average. Additionally, results on the Just-Eval benchmark further confirm PG's superiority to preserve the model's performance. our code is available at https://github.com/weiyezhimeng/Prefix-Guidance.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09135">Vanilla Gradient Descent for Oblique Decision Trees</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Subrat Prasad Panda, Blaise Genest, Arvind Easwaran, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision Trees (DTs) constitute one of the major highly non-linear AI models, valued, e.g., for their efficiency on tabular data. Learning accurate DTs is, however, complicated, especially for oblique DTs, and does take a significant training time. Further, DTs suffer from overfitting, e.g., they proverbially "do not generalize" in regression tasks. Recently, some works proposed ways to make (oblique) DTs differentiable. This enables highly efficient gradient-descent algorithms to be used to learn DTs. It also enables generalizing capabilities by learning regressors at the leaves simultaneously with the decisions in the tree. Prior approaches to making DTs differentiable rely either on probabilistic approximations at the tree's internal nodes (soft DTs) or on approximations in gradient computation at the internal node (quantized gradient descent). In this work, we propose DTSemNet, a novel semantically equivalent and invertible encoding for (hard, oblique) DTs as Neural Networks (NNs), that uses standard vanilla gradient descent. Experiments across various classification and regression benchmarks show that oblique DTs learned using DTSemNet are more accurate than oblique DTs of similar size learned using state-of-the-art techniques. Further, DT training time is significantly reduced. We also experimentally demonstrate that DTSemNet can learn DT policies as efficiently as NN policies in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) setup with physical inputs (dimensions $\leq32$).

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10096">Convert and Speak: Zero-shot Accent Conversion with Minimum Supervision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijun Jia, Huaying Xue, Xiulian Peng, Yan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low resource of parallel data is the key challenge of accent conversion(AC) problem in which both the pronunciation units and prosody pattern need to be converted. We propose a two-stage generative framework "convert-and-speak" in which the conversion is only operated on the semantic token level and the speech is synthesized conditioned on the converted semantic token with a speech generative model in target accent domain. The decoupling design enables the "speaking" module to use massive amount of target accent speech and relieves the parallel data required for the "conversion" module. Conversion with the bridge of semantic token also relieves the requirement for the data with text transcriptions and unlocks the usage of language pre-training technology to further efficiently reduce the need of parallel accent speech data. To reduce the complexity and latency of "speaking", a single-stage AR generative model is designed to achieve good quality as well as lower computation cost. Experiments on Indian-English to general American-English conversion show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in accent similarity, speech quality, and speaker maintenance with only 15 minutes of weakly parallel data which is not constrained to the same speaker. Extensive experimentation with diverse accent types suggests that this framework possesses a high degree of adaptability, making it readily scalable to accommodate other accents with low-resource data.

<p>Abstract: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is crucial for various real-world applications. While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow method that balances high accuracy with reduced computational demands. Building upon NeuFlow v1, we introduce new components including a much more light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module. Both these modules help in keeping the computational demands light while providing close to state of the art accuracy. Compares to other state of the art methods, our model achieves a 10x-70x speedup while maintaining comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world data. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional quantitative investment research is encountering diminishing returns alongside rising labor and time costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed to enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end learning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable of autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial data spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These "global patterns" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling, optimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture design of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and outline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument prediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Dian Lim, Hong Yu Li, Simon Chun Kiat Goh, Xiangyu Wang, Peng Zhao, Chuan Seng Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Chevalier, Duncan Starkenburg, Krishnamurthy Dvijotham</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of formal verification, Neural Networks (NNs) are typically reformulated into equivalent mathematical programs which are optimized over. To overcome the inherent non-convexity of these reformulations, convex relaxations of nonlinear activation functions are typically utilized. Common relaxations (i.e., static linear cuts) of "S-shaped" activation functions, however, can be overly loose, slowing down the overall verification process. In this paper, we derive tuneable hyperplanes which upper and lower bound the sigmoid activation function. When tuned in the dual space, these affine bounds smoothly rotate around the nonlinear manifold of the sigmoid activation function. This approach, termed $\alpha$-sig, allows us to tractably incorporate the tightest possible, element-wise convex relaxation of the sigmoid activation function into a formal verification framework. We embed these relaxations inside of large verification tasks and compare their performance to LiRPA and $\alpha$-CROWN, a state-of-the-art verification duo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manos Kirtas, Konstantinos Tsampazis, Loukia Avramelou, Nikolaos Passalis, Anastasios Tefas</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing deep learning models to learn part-based representations holds significant potential for interpretable-by-design approaches, as these models incorporate latent causes obtained from feature representations through simple addition. However, training a part-based learning model presents challenges, particularly in enforcing non-negative constraints on the model's parameters, which can result in training difficulties such as instability and convergence issues. Moreover, applying such approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is even more demanding due to the inherent instabilities that impact many optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a non-negative training approach for actor models in RL, enabling the extraction of part-based representations that enhance interpretability while adhering to non-negative constraints. To this end, we employ a non-negative initialization technique, as well as a modified sign-preserving training method, which can ensure better gradient flow compared to existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the well-known Cartpole benchmark.</p>
