<p><b>Authors:</b> Marlon Dumas, Fredrik Milani, David Chapela-Campa</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Urban Skvorc, Niki van Stein, Moritz Seiler, Britta Grimme, Thomas B\"ack, Heike Trautmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qusai Khaled, Bahjat Mallak, Uzay Kaymak, Laura Genga</p>
<p>Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Jaffe, Noah Reicin, Jinho D. Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Xu, Xiaokun Luan, Renxi Wang, Joshua Ong Jun Leang, Peixin Wang, Haonan Li, Wenda Li, Conrad Watt</p>
<p>Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nanhan Shen, Zhilei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19122">Exploring Weaknesses in Function Call Models via Reinforcement Learning: An Adversarial Data Augmentation Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiran Guo, Bing Bo, Shaoxiang Wu, Jingsheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19142">Length-Adaptive Interest Network for Balancing Long and Short Sequence Modeling in CTR Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Zhang, Zhaocheng Du, Jieming Zhu, Jiwei Tang, Fengyuan Lu, Wang Jiaheng, Song-Li Wu, Qianhui Zhu, Jingyu Li, Hai-Tao Zheng, Zhenhua Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19151">TS-Debate: Multimodal Collaborative Debate for Zero-Shot Time Series Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Patara Trirat, Jin Myung Kwak, Jay Heo, Heejun Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19155">LocationAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Image Geolocation via Decoupling Strategy and Evidence from Parametric Knowledge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiujun Li, Zijin Xiao, Xulin Wang, Zhidan Ma, Cheng Yang, Haifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyang Ying, Yanchi Liu, Xujiang Zhao, Wei Cheng, Zhengzhang Chen, Wenchao Yu, Yanjie Fu, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Li, Zhaocheng Du, Qianhui Zhu, kaiyuan Li, Zhicheng Zhang, Song-Li Wu, Chaolang Li, Pengwen Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van-Quang Nguyen, Takayuki Okatani</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixi Cai, Fucai Ke, Kevin Leo, Sukai Huang, Maria Garcia de la Banda, Peter J. Stuckey, Hamid Rezatofighi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Deng, Zhen Fang, Yixuan Li, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingkun Yin, Hongyang Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijia Li, Xiaoyu Tan, Shahir Ali, Niels Schmidt, Gengchen Ma, Xihe Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Khoa Ngo Ho, Martin Chauvin, Simon Gosset, Philippe Cordier, Boris Gamazaychikov</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models become integral to agentic artificial intelligence systems, their energy demands during inference may pose significant sustainability challenges. This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Results show that smaller open-weights models can lower energy usage while preserving task quality. Building on these findings, we propose practical guidelines for sustainable artificial intelligence design, including optimal batch size configuration and computation resource allocation. These insights offer actionable strategies for developing scalable, environmentally responsible artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Singh Bhatti, Vishal Vaddina, Dagnachew Birru</p>
<p>Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Temirbolat Maratuly, Pakizar Shamoi, Timur Samigulin</p>
<p>Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marthe Ballon, Andres Algaba, Brecht Verbeken, Vincent Ginis</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Xu, Siyang Xiao, Ming Liang, Yichen Yu, Zhixiang Wang, Jingxuan Xu, Dajun Chen, Wei Jiang, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyun Li, Ming Xiao, Kezhi Wang, Robert Schober, Dong In Kim, Yong Liang Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas B\"omer, Nico Koltermann, Max Disselnmeyer, Bastian Amberg, Anne Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh-Dung Dao, Quy Minh Le, Hoang Thanh Lam, Duc-Trong Le, Quoc-Viet Pham, Barry O'Sullivan, Hoang D. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shir Rozenfeld, Rahul Pankajakshan, Itay Zloczower, Eyal Lenga, Gilad Gressel, Yisroel Mirsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre Paulino de Lima, Paula Castro, Suzana Carvalho Vaz de Andrade, Rosa Maria Marcucci, Ruth Caldeira de Melo, Marcelo Garcia Manzato</p>
<p>Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialong Wu, Xiaoying Zhang, Hongyi Yuan, Xiangcheng Zhang, Tianhao Huang, Changjing He, Chaoyi Deng, Renrui Zhang, Youbin Wu, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.</p>

However, a basic application of artificial neural network could solve the problem based on the universal approximation theorem of the multilayer perceptron.

<p>Abstract: ECG-Language Models (ELMs) extend recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automated ECG interpretation. However, most ELMs follow Vision-Language Model (VLM) designs and depend on pretrained ECG encoders, adding architectural and training complexity. Inspired by encoder-free VLMs, we introduce ELF, an encoder-free ELM that replaces the ECG encoder with a single projection layer trained jointly with the LLM. Across five datasets, ELF matches or exceeds state-of-the-art ELMs that use far more complex encoders and training pipelines. We also test whether adding architectural biases to ELF improves performance and find that the single linear projection remains competitive. Finally, we show that ELF, and potentially other ELMs, often rely more on benchmark artifacts and language priors than ECG-derived information, highlighting limitations in current evaluation practices and ELM design.

<p>Abstract: As digital twins (DTs) evolve to become more agentic through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), they acquire capabilities that extend beyond dynamic representation of their target systems. This paper presents a taxonomy of agentic DTs organised around three fundamental dimensions: the locus of agency (external, internal, distributed), the tightness of coupling (loose, tight, constitutive), and model evolution (static, adaptive, reconstructive). From the resulting 27-configuration space, we identify nine illustrative configurations grouped into three clusters: "The Present" (existing tools and emerging steering systems), "The Threshold" (where emergent properties appear and coupling becomes constitutive), and "The Frontier" (where systems gain reconstructive capabilities).
  Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them. Using traffic navigation systems as examples, we show how even passive tools can exhibit emergent performativity, while advanced configurations risk performative lock-in. Drawing on performative prediction theory, we trace a progression from passive tools through active steering to ontological reconstruction, examining how constitutive coupling enables systems to create self-validating realities. Understanding these configurations is essential for navigating the transformation from DTs as mirror worlds to DTs as architects of new ontologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingsong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the cornerstone imaging modality for evaluating coronary artery stenosis and guiding interventional decision-making. However, interpretation based on single-frame angiographic images remains highly operator-dependent, and conventional deep learning models still face challenges in modeling complex vascular morphology and fine-grained texture patterns.Methods: We propose a Lightweight Quantum-Enhanced ResNet (LQER) for binary classification of coronary angiography images. A pretrained ResNet18 is employed as a classical feature extractor, while a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is introduced at the high-level semantic feature space for quantum feature enhancement. The quantum module utilizes data re-uploading and entanglement structures, followed by residual fusion with classical features, enabling end-to-end hybrid optimization with a strictly controlled number of qubits.Results: On an independent test set, the proposed LQER outperformed the classical ResNet18 baseline in accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, achieving a test accuracy exceeding 90%. The results demonstrate that lightweight quantum feature enhancement improves discrimination of positive lesions, particularly under class-imbalanced conditions.Conclusion: This study validates a practical hybrid quantum--classical learning paradigm for coronary angiography analysis, providing a feasible pathway for deploying quantum machine learning in medical imaging applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Grimson, Joshua Fan, Courtney L. Davis, Dylan van Bramer, Daniel Fink, Carla P. Gomes</p>
<p>Abstract: Global biodiversity loss is accelerating, prompting international efforts such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to direct resources toward halting species declines. A key challenge in achieving this goal is having access to robust methodologies to understand where species occur and how they relate to each other within broader ecological communities. Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Kadimisetty, Oswald C, Sivaselvan B, Alekhya Kadimisetty</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores the scope of Frequent Sequence Mining in the domain of Lossy Image Compression. The proposed work is based on the idea of clustering pixels and using the cluster identifiers in the compression. The DCT phase in JPEG is replaced with a combination of closed frequent sequence mining and k-means clustering to handle the redundant data effectively. This method focuses mainly on applying k-means clustering in parallel to all blocks of each component of the image to reduce the compression time. Conventional GSP algorithm is refined to optimize the cardinality of patterns through a novel pruning strategy, thus achieving a good reduction in the code table size. Simulations of the proposed algorithm indicate significant gains in compression ratio and quality in relation to the existing alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu An, Duaa Nakshbandi, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) implicitly aggregates heterogeneous human preferences into a single utility function, even though the underlying utilities of the participants are in practice diverse. Hence, RLHF can be viewed as a form of voting, where the aggregation mechanism is defined by the loss function. Although Arrow's Impossibility Theorem suggests that different mechanisms satisfy different sets of desirable axioms, most existing methods rely on a single aggregation principle, typically the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, which corresponds to Borda count voting. This restricts the axiomatic properties of the learned reward and obscures the normative assumptions embedded in optimization. In this work, we introduce Differential Voting, a unifying framework that constructs instance-wise, differentiable loss functions whose population-level optima provably correspond to distinct classical voting rules. We develop differentiable surrogates for majority-based aggregation (BTL), Copeland, and Kemeny rules, and formally analyze their calibration properties, gradient fields, and limiting behavior as smoothing parameters vanish. For each loss, we establish consistency with the corresponding social choice rule and characterize the axioms it satisfies or violates. Our analysis shows how design choices in loss geometry-such as margin sensitivity and boundary concentration-directly translate into normative aggregation behavior. Differential Voting makes preference aggregation an explicit and controllable design choice in RLHF, enabling principled trade-offs between axiomatic guarantees and optimization stability. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based agents are rapidly being adopted across diverse domains. Since they interact with users without supervision, they must be tested extensively. Current testing approaches focus on acceptance-level evaluation from the user's perspective. While intuitive, these tests require manual evaluation, are difficult to automate, do not facilitate root cause analysis, and incur expensive test environments. In this paper, we present methods to enable structural testing of LLM-based agents. Our approach utilizes traces (based on OpenTelemetry) to capture agent trajectories, employs mocking to enforce reproducible LLM behavior, and adds assertions to automate test verification. This enables testing agent components and interactions at a deeper technical level within automated workflows. We demonstrate how structural testing enables the adaptation of software engineering best practices to agents, including the test automation pyramid, regression testing, test-driven development, and multi-language testing. In representative case studies, we demonstrate automated execution and faster root-cause analysis. Collectively, these methods reduce testing costs and improve agent quality through higher coverage, reusability, and earlier defect detection. We provide an open source reference implementation on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Zare</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaohua Zha, Chunlin Fan, Peiyuan Liu, Yong Jiang, Tao Dai, Hai Wu, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.</p>

We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deep Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Aggregate analytics over conversational data are increasingly used for safety monitoring, governance, and product analysis in large language model systems. A common practice is to embed conversations, cluster them, and publish short textual summaries describing each cluster. While raw conversations may never be exposed, these derived summaries can still pose privacy risks if they contain personally identifying information (PII) or uniquely traceable strings copied from individual conversations.
  We introduce CanaryBench, a simple and reproducible stress test for privacy leakage in cluster-level conversation summaries. CanaryBench generates synthetic conversations with planted secret strings ("canaries") that simulate sensitive identifiers. Because canaries are known a priori, any appearance of these strings in published summaries constitutes a measurable leak.
  Using TF-IDF embeddings and k-means clustering on 3,000 synthetic conversations (24 topics) with a canary injection rate of 0.60, we evaluate an intentionally extractive example snippet summarizer that models quote-like reporting. In this configuration, we observe canary leakage in 50 of 52 canary-containing clusters (cluster-level leakage rate 0.961538), along with nonzero regex-based PII indicator counts. A minimal defense combining a minimum cluster-size publication threshold (k-min = 25) and regex-based redaction eliminates measured canary leakage and PII indicator hits in the reported run while maintaining a similar cluster-coherence proxy. We position this work as a societal impacts contribution centered on privacy risk measurement for published analytics artifacts rather than raw user data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Wang, Zhiling Zhang, Wenbo Zhou, Weiming Zhang, Jie Zhang, Qiannan Zhu, Yu Shi, Shuxin Zheng, Jiyan He</p>
<p>Abstract: GUI agents enable end-to-end automation through direct perception of and interaction with on-screen interfaces. However, these agents frequently access interfaces containing sensitive personal information, and screenshots are often transmitted to remote models, creating substantial privacy risks. These risks are particularly severe in GUI workflows: GUIs expose richer, more accessible private information, and privacy risks depend on interaction trajectories across sequential scenes. We propose GUIGuard, a three-stage framework for privacy-preserving GUI agents: (1) privacy recognition, (2) privacy protection, and (3) task execution under protection. We further construct GUIGuard-Bench, a cross-platform benchmark with 630 trajectories and 13,830 screenshots, annotated with region-level privacy grounding and fine-grained labels of risk level, privacy category, and task necessity. Evaluations reveal that existing agents exhibit limited privacy recognition, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 13.3% accuracy on Android and 1.4% on PC. Under privacy protection, task-planning semantics can still be maintained, with closed-source models showing stronger semantic consistency than open-source ones. Case studies on MobileWorld show that carefully designed protection strategies achieve higher task accuracy while preserving privacy. Our results highlight privacy recognition as a critical bottleneck for practical GUI agents. Project: https://futuresis.github.io/GUIGuard-page/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueying Du, Jiayi Feng, Yi Zou, Wei Xu, Jie Ma, Wei Zhang, Sisi Liu, Xin Peng, Yiling Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Static analysis tools (SATs) are widely adopted in both academia and industry for improving software quality, yet their practical use is often hindered by high false positive rates, especially in large-scale enterprise systems. These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review. Finally, our case analysis further identifies key limitations of LLM-based false alarm reduction in industrial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wu, Jie Xu, Yun Peng, Chun Yong Chong, Xiaohua Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to automate real-world vulnerability detection due to two key limitations: the heterogeneity of vulnerability patterns undermines the effectiveness of a single unified model, and manual prompt engineering for massive weakness categories is unscalable.
  To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MulVul}, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for precise and broad-coverage vulnerability detection. MulVul adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy: a \emph{Router} agent first predicts the top-$k$ coarse categories and then forwards the input to specialized \emph{Detector} agents, which identify the exact vulnerability types. Both agents are equipped with retrieval tools to actively source evidence from vulnerability knowledge bases to mitigate hallucinations.
  Crucially, to automate the generation of specialized prompts, we design \emph{Cross-Model Prompt Evolution}, a prompt optimization mechanism where a generator LLM iteratively refines candidate prompts while a distinct executor LLM validates their effectiveness. This decoupling mitigates the self-correction bias inherent in single-model optimization.
  Evaluated on 130 CWE types, MulVul achieves 34.79\% Macro-F1, outperforming the best baseline by 41.5\%. Ablation studies validate cross-model prompt evolution, which boosts performance by 51.6\% over manual prompts by effectively handling diverse vulnerability patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu An, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization-the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar components-remains a persistent challenge for neural networks. Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization.

<p>Abstract: Auditory Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of speech and audio understanding tasks. Nevertheless, they often struggle when applied to low-resource or unfamiliar tasks. In case of labeled in-domain data is scarce or mismatched to the true test distribution, direct fine-tuning can be brittle. In-Context Learning (ICL) provides a training-free, inference-time solution by adapting auditory LLMs through conditioning on a few in-domain demonstrations. In this work, we first show that \emph{Vanilla ICL}, improves zero-shot performance across diverse speech and audio tasks for selected models which suggest this ICL adaptation capability can be generalized to multimodal setting. Building on this, we propose \textbf{Speech In-Context Learning Adaptation Training (SICL-AT)}, a post-training recipe utilizes only high resource speech data intending to strengthen model's in-context learning capability. The enhancement can generalize to audio understanding/reasoning task. Experiments indicate our proposed method consistently outperforms direct fine-tuning in low-resource scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seiji Shaw, Travis Manderson, Chad Kessens, Nicholas Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional evaluations of reasoning capabilities of language models are dominated by adult-centric benchmarks that presuppose broad world knowledge, complex instruction following, and mature pragmatic competence. These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been employed in neural networks (NNs) as stochastic neurons with sigmoidal probabilistic activation functions. Nonetheless, there remain a wealth of other probabilistic activation functions that are yet to be explored. Here we re-engineer the p-bit by decoupling its stochastic signal path from its input data path, giving rise to a modular p-bit that enables the realization of probabilistic neurons (p-neurons) with a range of configurable probabilistic activation functions, including a probabilistic version of the widely used Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. We present spintronic (CMOS + sMTJ) designs that show wide and tunable probabilistic ranges of operation. Finally, we experimentally implement digital-CMOS versions on an FPGA, with stochastic unit sharing, and demonstrate an order of magnitude (10x) saving in required hardware resources compared to conventional digital p-bit implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cole Granger, Dipin Khati, Daniel Rodriguez-Cardenas, Denys Poshyvanyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, yet they often introduce subtle logic or data-misuse errors that differ from human bugs. To study how these two error types interact, we construct Tricky$^2$, a hybrid dataset that augments the existing TrickyBugs corpus of human-written defects with errors injected by both GPT-5 and OpenAI-oss-20b across C++, Python, and Java programs. Our approach uses a taxonomy-guided prompting framework to generate machine-originated bugs while preserving original human defects and program structure. The resulting corpus spans human-only, LLM-only, and human+LLM splits, enabling analysis of mixed-origin error behavior, multi-bug repair robustness, and reliability in hybrid human-machine code. This paper outlines the dataset construction pipeline and illustrates its use through small-scale baseline evaluations of classification, localization, and repair tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marin Bukov, Florian Marquardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in learned control, large-scale simulation, and generative models have accelerated progress toward general-purpose robotic controllers, yet the field still lacks platforms suitable for safe, expressive, long-term deployment in human environments. Most existing humanoids are either closed industrial systems or academic prototypes that are difficult to deploy and operate around people, limiting progress in robotics. We introduce Sprout, a developer platform designed to address these limitations through an emphasis on safety, expressivity, and developer accessibility. Sprout adopts a lightweight form factor with compliant control, limited joint torques, and soft exteriors to support safe operation in shared human spaces. The platform integrates whole-body control, manipulation with integrated grippers, and virtual-reality-based teleoperation within a unified hardware-software stack. An expressive head further enables social interaction -- a domain that remains underexplored on most utilitarian humanoids. By lowering physical and technical barriers to deployment, Sprout expands access to capable humanoid platforms and provides a practical basis for developing embodied intelligence in real human environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oren Sultan, Jordi Armengol-Estape, Pascal Kesseli, Julien Vanegue, Dafna Shahaf, Yossi Adi, Peter O'Hearn</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cao, Hao Zhang, Fengrui Tian, Yulun Wu, Yingying Li, Shenlong Wang, Ning Yu, Yaoyao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera redirection aims to replay a dynamic scene from a single monocular video under a user-specified camera trajectory. However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation. Project page and code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangzhou Wu (Richard), Sandeep Silwal (Richard),  Qiuyi (Richard),  Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozheng Luo, Zhuolin Jiang, Md Zahid Hasan, Yan Chen, Soumalya Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antanas Zilinskas, Robert N. Shorten, Jakub Marecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19030">A Unifying View of Coverage in Linear Off-Policy Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip Amortila, Audrey Huang, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Nan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^\pi, d, 1/n,\log(1/\delta)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^\pi$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Design feedback helps practitioners improve their artifacts while also fostering reflection and design reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can support design work, but often provide generic, one-off suggestions that limit reflective engagement. We investigate how to guide LLMs to act as design mentors by applying the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model, which emphasizes demonstrating reasoning through six methods: modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. We operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting and evaluate them in a within-subjects study with data visualization practitioners. Participants interacted with both a baseline LLM and an instructional LLM designed with cognitive apprenticeship prompts. Surveys, interviews, and conversational log analyses compared experiences across conditions. Our findings show that cognitively informed prompts elicit deeper design reasoning and more reflective feedback exchanges, though the baseline is sometimes preferred depending on task types or experience levels. We distill design considerations for AI-assisted feedback systems that foster reflective practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipendra Misra, Aldo Pacchiano, Ta-Chung Chi, Ge Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mrinank Sharma, Miles McCain, Raymond Douglas, David Duvenaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Although AI assistants are now deeply embedded in society, there has been limited empirical study of how their usage affects human empowerment. We present the first large-scale empirical analysis of disempowerment patterns in real-world AI assistant interactions, analyzing 1.5 million consumer Claude.ai conversations using a privacy-preserving approach. We focus on situational disempowerment potential, which occurs when AI assistant interactions risk leading users to form distorted perceptions of reality, make inauthentic value judgments, or act in ways misaligned with their values. Quantitatively, we find that severe forms of disempowerment potential occur in fewer than one in a thousand conversations, though rates are substantially higher in personal domains like relationships and lifestyle. Qualitatively, we uncover several concerning patterns, such as validation of persecution narratives and grandiose identities with emphatic sycophantic language, definitive moral judgments about third parties, and complete scripting of value-laden personal communications that users appear to implement verbatim. Analysis of historical trends reveals an increase in the prevalence of disempowerment potential over time. We also find that interactions with greater disempowerment potential receive higher user approval ratings, possibly suggesting a tension between short-term user preferences and long-term human empowerment. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs) have been used in many agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) systems, primarily for validating promising fixes and aiding fix generation. In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code review automation, such as review comment generation, yet they suffer from hallucinations -- where the generated review comments are ungrounded in the actual code -- poses a significant challenge to the adoption of LLMs in code review workflows. To address this, we explore effective and scalable methods for a hallucination detection in LLM-generated code review comments without the reference. In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production. Our results suggest that HalluJudge can serve as a practical safeguard to reduce developers' exposure to hallucinated comments, fostering trust in AI-assisted code reviews.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bochao Liu, Shiming Ge, Pengju Wang, Shikun Li, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Hou, Hongyi Jin, Guanjie Wang, Jinqi Chen, Yaxing Cai, Lijie Yang, Zihao Ye, Yaoyao Ding, Ruihang Lai, Tianqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling modern deep learning workloads demands coordinated placement of data and compute across device meshes, memory hierarchies, and heterogeneous accelerators. We present Axe Layout, a hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space via named axes. Axe unifies tiling, sharding, replication, and offsets across inter-device distribution and on-device layouts, enabling collective primitives to be expressed consistently from device meshes to threads. Building on Axe, we design a multi-granularity, distribution-aware DSL and compiler that composes thread-local control with collective operators in a single kernel. Experiments show that our unified approach can bring performance close to hand-tuned kernels on across latest GPU devices and multi-device environments and accelerator backends.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingcheng Yu, Mingliang Zeng, Qiwei Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yosub Shin, Michael Buriek, Igor Molybog</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipin Khati, Daniel Rodriguez-Cardenas, Paul Pantzer, Denys Poshyvanyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation boost productivity but frequently introduce Knowledge Conflicting Hallucinations (KCHs), subtle, semantic errors, such as non-existent API parameters, that evade linters and cause runtime failures. Existing mitigations like constrained decoding or non-deterministic LLM-in-the-loop repair are often unreliable for these errors. This paper investigates whether a deterministic, static-analysis framework can reliably detect \textit{and} auto-correct KCHs. We propose a post-processing framework that parses generated code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and validates it against a dynamically-generated Knowledge Base (KB) built via library introspection. This non-executing approach uses deterministic rules to find and fix both API and identifier-level conflicts. On a manually-curated dataset of 200 Python snippets, our framework detected KCHs with 100\% precision and 87.6\% recall (0.934 F1-score), and successfully auto-corrected 77.0\% of all identified hallucinations. Our findings demonstrate that this deterministic post-processing approach is a viable and reliable alternative to probabilistic repair, offering a clear path toward trustworthy code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puzhen Wu, Han Weng, Quan Zheng, Yi Zhan, Hewei Wang, Yiming Li, Jiahui Han, Rui Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wachiraphan Charoenwet, Kla Tantithamthavorn, Patanamon Thongtanunam, Hong Yi Lin, Minwoo Jeong, Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Secure code review is critical at the pre-commit stage, where vulnerabilities must be caught early under tight latency and limited-context constraints. Existing SAST-based checks are noisy and often miss immature, context-dependent vulnerabilities, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by context windows and lack explicit tool use. Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines. These findings highlight the importance of Agentic Secure Code Review, paving the way towards an emerging research area of immature vulnerability detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhyeon Park, Soohyun Lee, Eugene Choi, Hyunwoo Kim, Minkyu Kweon, Yumin Song, Jinwook Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: While generative AI enables high-fidelity UI generation from text prompts, users struggle to articulate design intent and evaluate or refine results-creating gulfs of execution and evaluation. To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement. Our work demonstrates how explicit semantic representation enables systematic and explainable exploration of design possibilities in AI-driven UI design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sponge attacks increasingly threaten LLM systems by inducing excessive computation and DoS. Existing defenses either rely on statistical filters that fail on semantically meaningful attacks or use static LLM-based detectors that struggle to adapt as attack strategies evolve. We introduce SHIELD, a multi-agent, auto-healing defense framework centered on a three-stage Defense Agent that integrates semantic similarity retrieval, pattern matching, and LLM-based reasoning. Two auxiliary agents, a Knowledge Updating Agent and a Prompt Optimization Agent, form a closed self-healing loop, when an attack bypasses detection, the system updates an evolving knowledgebase, and refines defense instructions. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD consistently outperforms perplexity-based and standalone LLM defenses, achieving high F1 scores across both non-semantic and semantic sponge attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of agentic self-healing against evolving resource-exhaustion threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinkyu Sung, Myunggeum Jee, Joonseok Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.</p>

However, existing evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on traditional accuracy metrics, failing to capture the multifaceted human-centered qualities that determine the real-world user experience. We introduce \framework{} (\textbf{H}uman-centered \textbf{E}valuation for \textbf{L}LM-powered reco\textbf{M}menders), a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM-powered recommender systems across five human-centered dimensions: \textit{Intent Alignment}, \textit{Explanation Quality}, \textit{Interaction Naturalness}, \textit{Trust \& Transparency}, and \textit{Fairness \& Diversity}. Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58).

<p>Abstract: Designing enzymes with substrate-binding pockets is a critical challenge in protein engineering, as catalytic activity depends on the precise interaction between pockets and substrates. Currently, generative models dominate functional protein design but cannot model pocket-substrate interactions, which limits the generation of enzymes with precise catalytic environments. To address this issue, we propose EnzyPGM, a unified framework that jointly generates enzymes and substrate-binding pockets conditioned on functional priors and substrates, with a particular focus on learning accurate pocket-substrate interactions. At its core, EnzyPGM includes two main modules: a Residue-atom Bi-scale Attention (RBA) that jointly models intra-residue dependencies and fine-grained interactions between pocket residues and substrate atoms, and a Residue Function Fusion (RFF) that incorporates enzyme function priors into residue representations. Also, we curate EnzyPock, an enzyme-pocket dataset comprising 83,062 enzyme-substrate pairs across 1,036 four-level enzyme families. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EnzyPGM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EnzyPock. Notably, EnzyPGM reduces the average binding energy of 0.47 kcal/mol over EnzyGen, showing its superior performance on substrate-specific enzyme design. The code and dataset will be released later.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting actionable suggestions from customer reviews is essential for operational decision-making, yet these directives are often embedded within mixed-intent, unstructured text. Existing approaches either classify suggestion-bearing sentences or generate high-level summaries, but rarely isolate the precise improvement instructions businesses need. We evaluate a hybrid pipeline combining a high-recall RoBERTa classifier trained with a precision-recall surrogate to reduce unrecoverable false negatives with a controlled, instruction-tuned LLM for suggestion extraction, categorization, clustering, and summarization. Across real-world hospitality and food datasets, the hybrid system outperforms prompt-only, rule-based, and classifier-only baselines in extraction accuracy and cluster coherence. Human evaluations further confirm that the resulting suggestions and summaries are clear, faithful, and interpretable. Overall, our results show that hybrid reasoning architectures achieve meaningful improvements fine-grained actionable suggestion mining while highlighting challenges in domain adaptation and efficient local deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emerging applications of next-generation wireless networks (e.g., immersive 3D communication, low-altitude networks, and integrated sensing and communication) necessitate high-fidelity environmental intelligence. 3D radio maps have emerged as a critical tool for this purpose, enabling spectrum-aware planning and environment-aware sensing by bridging the gap between physical environments and electromagnetic signal propagation. However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods. This work establishes a foundation for next-generation wireless networks by integrating perception, interaction, and communication through holistic radiation field reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaehyun Um, KyuHwan Yeom, Haerim Yang, Minyoung Choi, Hyeongjun Yang, Kyong-Ho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Si, Xuyang Liu, Penglei Wang, Xin Guo, Yuan Qi, Yuan Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoting Zhang, Shekhar Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Longtao Hu, Yida Xiong, Jiajun Yu, Hongzhi Zhang, Jiameng Chen, Xiantao Cai, Jia Wu, Wenbin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular representation learning aims to learn vector embeddings that capture molecular structure and geometry, thereby enabling property prediction and downstream scientific applications. In many AI for science tasks, labeled data are expensive to obtain and therefore limited in availability. Under the few-shot setting, models trained with scarce supervision often learn brittle structure-property relationships, resulting in substantially higher prediction errors and reduced generalization to unseen molecules. To address this limitation, we propose PCEvo, a path-consistent representation method that learns from virtual paths through dynamic structural evolution. PCEvo enumerates multiple chemically feasible edit paths between retrieved similar molecular pairs under topological dependency constraints. It transforms the labels of the two molecules into stepwise supervision along each virtual evolutionary path. It introduces a path-consistency objective that enforces prediction invariance across alternative paths connecting the same two molecules. Comprehensive experiments on the QM9 and MoleculeNet datasets demonstrate that PCEvo substantially improves the few-shot generalization performance of baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkyu Kweon, Seokhyeon Park, Soohyun Lee, You Been Lee, Jeongmin Rhee, Jinwook Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern mobile applications rely on hidden interactions--gestures without visual cues like long presses and swipes--to provide functionality without cluttering interfaces. While experienced users may discover these interactions through prior use or onboarding tutorials, their implicit nature makes them difficult for most users to uncover. Similarly, mobile agents--systems designed to automate tasks on mobile user interfaces, powered by vision language models (VLMs)--struggle to detect veiled interactions or determine actions for completing tasks. To address this challenge, we present GhostUI, a new dataset designed to enable the detection of hidden interactions in mobile applications. GhostUI provides before-and-after screenshots, simplified view hierarchies, gesture metadata, and task descriptions, allowing VLMs to better recognize concealed gestures and anticipate post-interaction states. Quantitative evaluations with VLMs show that models fine-tuned on GhostUI outperform baseline VLMs, particularly in predicting hidden interactions and inferring post-interaction screens, underscoring GhostUI's potential as a foundation for advancing mobile task automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anower Zihad, Felix Owino, Haibo Yang, Ming Tang, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niharika Sri Parasa, Chaitali Diwan, Srinath Srinivasa</p>
<p>Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatsuya Kamijo, Mai Nishimura, Cristian C. Beltran-Hernandez, Nodoka Shibasaki, Masashi Hamaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjia Zhang, Weiqin Yang, Jiawei Chen, Peng Wu, Yuegang Sun, Gang Wang, Qihao Shi, Can Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) aim to retrieve a small set of items that best match individual user preferences. Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.
  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19280">Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-Driven Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kishan Panaganti, Zhenwen Liang, Wenhao Yu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Chou Lo, Patrick Vandewalle</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Chen, Sihan Chen, Xiaoyi Qu, Dan Zhao, Ruomei Yan, Jongwoo Ko, Luming Liang, Pashmina Cameron</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

<p>Abstract: We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhe Chai, Yu Zhe, Jun Sakuma</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao-Han Peng, Shaohui Li, Zhi Li, Shulan Ruan, Yu Liu, You He</p>
<p>Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Xu, Li Rong Wang, Xiuyi Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wan, Penghui Qi, Guangxing Huang, Chaoyi Ruan, Min Lin, Jialin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern data parallel (DP) training favors collective communication over parameter servers (PS) for its simplicity and efficiency under balanced workloads. However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training. Our implementation of ODC and integration with FSDP is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/odc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quy-Anh Dang, Chris Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samir Sadok, St\'ephane Lathuili\`ere, Xavier Alameda-Pineda</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent speech modeling relies on explicit attributes such as pitch, content, and speaker identity, but these alone cannot capture the full richness of natural speech. We introduce RT-MAE, a novel masked autoencoder framework that augments the supervised attributes-based modeling with unsupervised residual trainable tokens, designed to encode the information not explained by explicit labeled factors (e.g., timbre variations, noise, emotion etc). Experiments show that RT-MAE improves reconstruction quality, preserving content and speaker similarity while enhancing expressivity. We further demonstrate its applicability to speech enhancement, removing noise at inference while maintaining controllability and naturalness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Obstructions such as raindrops, fences, or dust degrade captured images, especially when mechanical cleaning is infeasible. Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaipeng Fang, Weiqing Liang, Yuyang Li, Ji Zhang, Pengpeng Zeng, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic simulation data and real-world human data provide scalable alternatives to circumvent the prohibitive costs of robot data collection. However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks. Empirically, SimHum outperforms the baseline by up to $\mathbf{40\%}$ under the same data collection budget, and achieves a $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ OOD success with only 80 real data, outperforming the real only baseline by $7.1\times$.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengwei Xu, Zhaohua Chen, Xiaotie Deng, Zhiyi Huang, Grant Schoenebeck</p>
<p>Abstract: Sustainable monetization of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical open challenge. Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.
  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an "LLM-as-a-Judge" metric to estimate contextual coherence. Our experiments show that this metric correlates strongly with human ratings (Spearman's $\rho\approx 0.66$), outperforming 80% of individual human evaluators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'itor N. Louren\c{c}o, Aline Paes, Tillman Weyde, Audrey Depeige, Mohnish Dubey</p>
<p>Abstract: Claim verification is a core component of automated fact-checking systems, aimed at determining the truthfulness of a statement by assessing it against reliable evidence sources such as documents or knowledge bases. This work presents KG-CRAFT, a method that improves automatic claim verification by leveraging large language models (LLMs) augmented with contrastive questions grounded in a knowledge graph. KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Finn Rietz, Pedro Zuidberg dos Martires, Johannes Andreas Stork</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victoria Catterall, Cise Midoglu, Stephen Lynch</p>
<p>Abstract: Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Zhang, Dongxia Wang, Yi Liu, Kexin Chen, Wenhai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

<p>Abstract: High-quality evaluation benchmarks are pivotal for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Code Review (ACR). However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an "AI-assisted, Expert-verified" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285\% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Bongratz, Yitong Li, Sama Elbaroudy, Christian Wachinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Anda Cheng, Yinggui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech separation (SS) has advanced significantly with neural network-based methods, showing improved performance on signal-level metrics. However, these methods often struggle to maintain speech intelligibility in the separated signals, which can negatively affect the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. In this work, we propose SLM-SS, a novel approach that applies speech language models to SS, aiming to enhance the intelligibility and coherence of the separated signals. We frame SS as discrete multi-codebook sequence generation, using Encoder-Decoder models to map quantized speech mixtures to target tokens. In addition to the autoregressive modeling strategy, we introduce a non-autoregressive model to improve decoding efficiency for residual tokens. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset demonstrate that our approach shows significantly better preservation of speech intelligibility, leading to improved linguistic consistency in a variety of downstream tasks compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.</p>

Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjun Xia, Yanchun Peng, Xianzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code3-18D3/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqi Wang, Xiaofeng Ji, Jie Wang, Qingbin Li, Xiao Xiong, Zheming Yang, Jian Xu, Minghui Qiu, Xinxiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.</p>

While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shentong Mo, Zehua Chen, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runyu Peng, Yunhua Zhou, Demin Song, Kai Lv, Bo Wang, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Wendl, Yarden As, Manish Prajapat, Anton Pollak, Stelian Coros, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhong Wang, Ya Guo, Jing Li, Huan Chen, Yi Tu, Yijie Hong, Gongshen Liu, Huijia Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizheng Jiang, Kang Zhao, Weikai Xu, Xinkui Lin, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Shuo Shang, Peng Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongxi Wang, Zhuoyang Xia, Xinran Chen, Shan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning often faces environment drift, but most existing methods rely on static entropy coefficients/target entropy, causing over-exploration during stable periods and under-exploration after drift (thus slow recovery), and leaving unanswered the principled question of how exploration intensity should scale with drift magnitude. We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decidability or complexity issues about the consistency problem for description logics with concrete domains have already been analysed with tableaux-based or type elimination methods. Concrete domains in ontologies are essential to consider concrete objects and predefined relations. In this work, we expose an automata-based approach leading to the optimal upper bound EXPTIME, that is designed by enriching the transitions with symbolic constraints. We show that the nonemptiness problem for such automata belongs to EXPTIME if the concrete domains satisfy a few simple properties. Then, we provide a reduction from the consistency problem for ontologies, yielding EXPTIME-membership.Thanks to the expressivity of constraint automata, the results are extended to additional ingredients such as inverse roles, functional role names and constraint assertions, while maintaining EXPTIME-membership, which illustrates the robustness of the approach</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihou Zhang, Zheyong Xie, Li Zhong, Haifeng Liu, Shaosheng Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waris Gill, Ahmad Humayun, Ali Anwar, Muhammad Ali Gulzar</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominic Weisser, Chlo\'e Hashimoto-Cullen, Benjamin Guedj</p>
<p>Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Repository-level code completion remains a challenging task for existing code large language models (code LLMs) due to their limited understanding of repository-specific context and domain knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark. The results show that our framework achieves superior performance and exhibits high generalizability across various code LLMs and programming languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance evaluation remains a complex challenge in audio separation, and existing evaluation metrics are often misaligned with human perception, course-grained, relying on ground truth signals. On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihua Fang, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Speaker embedding learning based on Euclidean space has achieved significant progress, but it is still insufficient in modeling hierarchical information within speaker features. Hyperbolic space, with its negative curvature geometric properties, can efficiently represent hierarchical information within a finite volume, making it more suitable for the feature distribution of speaker embeddings. In this paper, we propose Hyperbolic Softmax (H-Softmax) and Hyperbolic Additive Margin Softmax (HAM-Softmax) based on hyperbolic space. H-Softmax incorporates hierarchical information into speaker embeddings by projecting embeddings and speaker centers into hyperbolic space and computing hyperbolic distances. HAM-Softmax further enhances inter-class separability by introducing margin constraint on this basis. Experimental results show that H-Softmax and HAM-Softmax achieve average relative EER reductions of 27.84% and 14.23% compared with standard Softmax and AM-Softmax, respectively, demonstrating that the proposed methods effectively improve speaker verification performance and at the same time preserve the capability of hierarchical structure modeling.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The dual offensive and defensive utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights a critical gap in AI security: the lack of unified frameworks for dynamic, iterative adversarial adaptation hardening. To bridge this gap, we propose the Red Team vs. Blue Team (RvB) framework, formulated as a training-free, sequential, imperfect-information game. In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits. RvB achieves Defense Success Rates of 90\% and 45\% across the respective tasks while maintaining near 0\% False Positive Rates, significantly surpassing baselines. This work establishes the iterative adversarial interaction framework as a practical paradigm that automates the continuous hardening of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Lizzio Bosco, Lukasz Cincio, Giuseppe Serra, M. Cerezo</p>
<p>Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runjia Zeng, Qifan Wang, Qiang Guan, Ruixiang Tang, Lifu Huang, Zhenting Wang, Xueling Zhang, Cheng Han, Dongfang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Liu, Taiyu Zhou, Tianqi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design has emerged as a promising direction. However, silicon-grade correctness remains bottlenecked by: (i) limited test coverage and reliability of simulation-centric evaluation, (ii) regressions and repair hallucinations introduced by iterative debugging, and (iii) semantic drift as intent is reinterpreted across agent handoffs. In this work, we propose Veri-Sure, a multi-agent framework that establishes a design contract to align agents' intent and uses a patching mechanism guided by static dependency slicing to perform precise, localized repairs. By integrating a multi-branch verification pipeline that combines trace-driven temporal analysis with formal verification consisting of assertion-based checking and boolean equivalence proofs, Veri-Sure enables functional correctness beyond pure simulations. We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The software engineering research community faces a systemic crisis: peer review is failing under growing submissions, misaligned incentives, and reviewer fatigue. Community surveys reveal that researchers perceive the process as "broken." This position paper argues that these dysfunctions are mechanism design failures amenable to computational solutions. We propose modeling the research community as a stochastic multi-agent system and applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to design incentive-compatible protocols. We outline three interventions: a credit-based submission economy, MARL-optimized reviewer assignment, and hybrid verification of review consistency. We present threat models, equity considerations, and phased pilot metrics. This vision charts a research agenda toward sustainable peer review.</p>

<p>Abstract: For generative AI agents to partner effectively with human users, the ability to accurately predict human intent is critical. But this ability to collaborate remains limited by a critical deficit: an inability to model common ground. Here, we present a referential communication experiment with a factorial design involving director-matcher pairs (human-human, human-AI, AI-human, and AI-AI) that interact with multiple turns in repeated rounds to match pictures of objects not associated with any obvious lexicalized labels. We release the online pipeline for data collection, the tools and analyses for accuracy, efficiency, and lexical overlap, and a corpus of 356 dialogues (89 pairs over 4 rounds each) that unmasks LVLMs' limitations in interactively resolving referring expressions, a crucial skill that underlies human language use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Octavio Pappalardo</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> TrungKhang Tran, TrungTin Nguyen, Gersende Fort, Tung Doan, Hien Duy Nguyen, Binh T. Nguyen, Florence Forbes, Christopher Drovandi</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing high-volume, streaming data is increasingly common in modern statistics and machine learning, where batch-mode algorithms are often impractical because they require repeated passes over the full dataset. This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling. Beyond synthetic experiments, we also validate practical effectiveness on two real-world datasets, including a bioinformatics study of dent maize genotypes under drought stress that integrates high-dimensional proteomics with ecophysiological traits, where incremental stochastic MM yields stable gains in predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Astaraki, Mohammad Arshi Saloot, Ali Shiraee Kasmaee, Hamidreza Mahyar, Soheila Samiee</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeanne Mal\'ecot, Hamed Rahimi, Jeanne Cattoni, Marie Samson, Mouad Abrini, Mahdi Khoramshahi, Maribel Pino, Mohamed Chetouani</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing human-robot interaction systems often lack mechanisms for sustained personalization and dynamic adaptation in multi-user environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Bornstein, Amrit Singh Bedi</p>
<p>Abstract: The race for artificial intelligence (AI) dominance often prioritizes scale over efficiency. Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies. As a call to action, we propose a cap-and-trade system for AI. Our system provably reduces computations for AI deployment, thereby lowering emissions and monetizing efficiency to the benefit of of academics and smaller companies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Naser Lessani, Zhenlong Li, Manzhu Yu, Helen Greatrex, Chan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The first law of geography is a cornerstone of spatial analysis, emphasizing that nearby and related locations tend to be more similar, however, defining what constitutes "near" and "related" remains challenging, as different phenomena exhibit distinct spatial patterns. Traditional local regression models, such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR), quantify spatial relationships solely through geographic proximity. In an era of globalization and digital connectivity, however, geographic proximity alone may be insufficient to capture how locations are interconnected. To address this limitation, we propose a new multiscale local regression framework, termed M-SGWR, which characterizes spatial interaction across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. For each predictor, geographic and attribute-based weight matrices are constructed separately and then combined using an optimized parameter, alpha, which governs their relative contribution to local model fitting. Analogous to variable-specific bandwidths in MGWR, the optimal alpha varies by predictor, allowing the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects. Results from two simulation experiments and one empirical application demonstrate that M-SGWR consistently outperforms GWR, SGWR, and MGWR across all goodness-of-fit metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewoon Kim, Vincent Fran\c{c}ois-Lavet, Michael Cochez</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents in partially observable environments require persistent memory to integrate observations over time. While KGs (knowledge graphs) provide a natural representation for such evolving state, existing benchmarks rarely expose agents to environments where both the world dynamics and the agent's memory are explicitly graph-shaped. We introduce the Room Environment v3, a configurable environment whose hidden state is an RDF KG and whose observations are RDF triples. The agent may extend these observations into a temporal KG when storing them in long-term memory. The environment is easily adjustable in terms of grid size, number of rooms, inner walls, and moving objects.
  We define a lightweight temporal KG memory for agents, based on RDF-star-style qualifiers (time_added, last_accessed, num_recalled), and evaluate several symbolic baselines that maintain and query this memory under different capacity constraints. Two neural sequence models (LSTM and Transformer) serve as contrasting baselines without explicit KG structure. Agents train on one layout and are evaluated on a held-out layout with the same dynamics but a different query order, exposing train-test generalization gaps. In this setting, temporal qualifiers lead to more stable performance, and the symbolic TKG (temporal knowledge graph) agent achieves roughly fourfold higher test QA (question-answer) accuracy than the neural baselines under the same environment and query conditions. The environment, agent implementations, and experimental scripts are released for reproducible research at https://github.com/humemai/agent-room-env-v3 and https://github.com/humemai/room-env.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in power systems is crucial for operational planning and grid management. There is a growing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling the increasing variability, constraints, and uncertainties in modern power networks while providing accurate and fast solutions. To address this, machine learning techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising approaches. This letter introduces PowerGraph-LLM, the first framework explicitly designed for solving OPF problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach combines graph and tabular representations of power grids to effectively query LLMs, capturing the complex relationships and constraints in power systems. A new implementation of in-context learning and fine-tuning protocols for LLMs is introduced, tailored specifically for the OPF problem. PowerGraph-LLM demonstrates reliable performances using off-the-shelf LLM. Our study reveals the impact of LLM architecture, size, and fine-tuning and demonstrates our framework's ability to handle realistic grid components and constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate state estimation is fundamental to intelligent vehicles. Wheel load, one of the most important chassis states, serves as an essential input for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and exerts a direct influence on vehicle stability and safety. However, wheel load estimation remains challenging due to the complexity of chassis modeling and the susceptibility of nonlinear systems to noise. To address these issues, this paper first introduces a refined suspension linkage-level modeling approach that constructs a nonlinear instantaneous dynamic model by explicitly considering the complex geometric structure of the suspension. Building upon this, we propose a damper characteristics-based Bayesian physics-informed neural network (Damper-B-PINN) framework to estimate dynamic wheel load, which leverages the suspension dynamics as physical guidance of PINN while employing Bayesian inference to mitigate the effects of system noise and uncertainty. Moreover, a damper-characteristic physics conditioning (DPC) module is designed for embedding physical prior. The proposed Damper-B-PINN is evaluated using both high-fidelity simulation datasets generated by CarSim software and real-world datasets collected from a Formula Student race car. Experimental results demonstrate that our Damper-B-PINN consistently outperforms existing methods across various test conditions, particularly extreme ones. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed Damper-B-PINN framework to enhance the accuracy and robustness of dynamic wheel load estimation, thereby improving the reliability and safety of ADAS applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyue Hao, Sibo Li, Jian Yuan, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya Wen, Jixuan Cai, Qiyao Ma, Linyan Li, Xinhua Chen, Chris Webster, Yulun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence, with increasingly diverging philosophies and techniques. While Earth observation paradigms excel at depicting locations in their physical states, we claim that a location's comprehensive "meaning" is better grounded in its internal human activity patterns and, crucially, its functional relationships with other locations, as revealed by human movement. We present MoRA, a human-centric geospatial framework that leverages a mobility graph as its core backbone to fuse various data modalities, aiming to learn embeddings that represent the socio-economic context and functional role of a location. MoRA achieves this through the integration of spatial tokenization, GNNs, and asymmetric contrastive learning to align 100M+ POIs, massive remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph, ensuring the three auxiliary modalities are interpreted through the lens of fundamental human dynamics. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of MoRA, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 9 downstream prediction tasks across social and economic domains. Experiments show that MoRA, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves superior predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 12.9%. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning. We open-source code and pretrained models at: https://github.com/ylzhouchris/MoRA.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the ability of language models to reason about appropriate information disclosure - a central aspect of the evolving field of agentic privacy. Whereas previous works have focused on evaluating a model's ability to align with human decisions, we examine the role of ambiguity and missing context on model performance when making information-sharing decisions. We identify context ambiguity as a crucial barrier for high performance in privacy assessments. By designing Camber, a framework for context disambiguation, we show that model-generated decision rationales can reveal ambiguities and that systematically disambiguating context based on these rationales leads to significant accuracy improvements (up to 13.3% in precision and up to 22.3% in recall) as well as reductions in prompt sensitivity. Overall, our results indicate that approaches for context disambiguation are a promising way forward to enhance agentic privacy reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet, those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts. This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications in sensitive domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why their integration is beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kausik Lakkaraju, Siva Likitha Valluru, Biplav Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems increasingly mediate decisions in domains such as credit scoring and financial forecasting, their lack of transparency and bias raises critical concerns for fairness and public trust. Existing explainable AI (XAI) approaches largely serve developers, focusing on model justification rather than the needs of affected users or regulators. We introduce Holistic eXplainable AI (H-XAI), a framework that integrates causality-based rating methods with post-hoc explanation techniques to support transparent, stakeholder-aligned evaluation of AI systems deployed in online decision contexts. H-XAI treats explanation as an interactive, hypothesis-driven process, allowing users, auditors, and organizations to ask questions, test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically generated random and biased baselines. By combining global and instance-level explanations, H-XAI helps communicate model bias and instability that shape everyday digital decisions. Through case studies in credit risk assessment and stock price prediction, we show how H-XAI extends explainability beyond developers toward responsible and inclusive AI practices that strengthen accountability in sociotechnical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haifeng Li, Wang Guo, Haiyang Wu, Mengwei Wu, Jipeng Zhang, Qing Zhu, Yu Liu, Xin Huang, Chao Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making. While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications, lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges, including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkai Li, Liwen Sun, Zhenxiang Guan, Xuhui Zhou, Maarten Sap</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage (\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zetian Sun, Dongfang Li, Xuhui Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The alignment of language models~(LMs) with human preferences is critical for building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling~(i.e., preference candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment. However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a $3\times$ effectiveness compared with static data for Llama-3, and a $0.4\times$ effectiveness for Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption, which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on $5$ models~(Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and $2$ alignment methods~(DPO, SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and the effectiveness of the boundary measurement algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zetian Sun, Dongfang Li, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo (MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte \textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points, the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32 sampling experiment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Atwell, Pedram Heydari, Anthony Sicilia, Malihe Alikhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) poses a fundamental challenge for human-AI collaboration, particularly in high-stakes decision-making domains such as health, law, and education. A central difficulty in studying sycophancy in large language models (LLMs) is disentangling sycophantic belief shifts from rational changes in behavior driven by new evidence or user-provided information. Existing approaches either measure descriptive behavior changes or apply normative evaluations that rely on objective ground truth, limiting their applicability to subjective or uncertain tasks. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic framework, grounded in behavioral economics and rational decision theory, that explicitly separates sycophancy from rational belief updating. Within this framework, we achieve three objectives: (i) a descriptive metric that measures sycophancy while controlling for rational responses to evidence; (ii) a normative metric that quantifies how sycophancy leads models astray from Bayesian-consistent belief updating; and (iii) the ability to apply both metrics in settings without ground-truth labels. Applying our framework across multiple LLMs and three uncertainty-driven tasks, we find robust evidence of sycophantic belief shifts and show that their impact on rationality depends on whether models systematically over- or under-update their beliefs. Finally, we demonstrate that a post-hoc calibration method and two fine-tuning strategies (SFT and DPO) substantially reduce Bayesian inconsistency, with particularly strong improvements under explicit sycophancy prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lun Ai, Johannes Langer, Ute Schmid, Stephen Muggleton</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. We introduce LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic framework that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models (LLMs). This framework automatically generates natural language explanations of learned logic programs, replacing hand-crafted templates used in prior USML work. Using LLMs-as-judges evaluation and expert validation, we show that LENS produces higher-quality explanations than both direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates. We then examine whether LENS explanations suffice for achieving USML in a human trial teaching active learning strategies across three related domains. Our exploratory analysis suggests that concise, expert-written explanations may benefit learners with higher initial performance, while LLM-generated explanations provide no advantage over human self learning despite being rated as higher quality. This case study reveals that achieving USML requires methods grounded in human learning, where current LLM-generated explanations do not capture human cognitive constraints and LLMs-as-judges evaluations do not reflect what effectively supports human learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Li, Alexander Gurung, Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by creating benchmark questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple full-text scientific articles. The questions and their ground-truth answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database constructed from article metadata (i.e., titles, authors, and references). These SQL queries provide explicit, verifiable reasoning processes that enable fine-grained error analysis on model answers, and the data construction scales to contexts of up to 1M tokens with minimal supervision. Experiments on open-weight and proprietary LLMs show that SciTrek poses significant challenges as the context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic shortcomings of frontier LLMs' ability to effectively perform numerical operations and accurately locate information in long contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Werbrouck, Marshall B. Lindsay, Matthew Maschmann, Matthias J. Young</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited probe capabilities without explicit instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Song, Keyu Wang, PengXiang Li, Lu Yin, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansen Zhang, Qingcan Kang, Yujie Chen, Yufei Wang, Xiongwei Han, Tao Zhong, Mingxuan Yuan, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average modeling accuracy by 7.7%, with gains of up to 21.9% on the ComplexLP dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, incur high compute costs, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</p>

<p>Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design, enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in sparse reward policy gradient methods have enabled effective reinforcement learning (RL) for language models post-training. However, for reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem solving, binarized outcome rewards provide limited feedback on intermediate reasoning steps. While some studies have attempted to address this issue by estimating overall reasoning quality, it remains unclear whether these rewards are reliable proxies for the quality of stepwise reasoning. In this study, we consider reasoning as a structured process and propose \textbf{TACReward}, the reward model that can be seamlessly integrated into sparse reward policy gradient methods without additional human annotation costs or architectural modifications. TACReward aggregates stepwise structural deviations between teacher and policy reasoning using process mining techniques, producing a scalar output reward range of $[0, 1]$ to indicate reasoning quality. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the TACReward into sparse reward frameworks encourages the policy model to improve the structural quality of reasoning. Consequently, this leads to consistent performance improvements over existing sparse reward frameworks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danial Safaei, Siddartha Khastgir, Mohsen Alirezaei, Jeroen Ploeg, Son Tong, Xingyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on consistent decision evidence in both real and simulated environments, not just whether images "look real" to humans. To this end this paper proposes a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity, that is, agreement in the model-specific decisive evidence that drives the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.</p>

<p>Abstract: As agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) advance, improving performance in context understanding, tool usage, and long-horizon execution has become critical. However, existing agent frameworks and benchmarks provide limited visibility into execution-level behavior, making failures in tool invocation, state tracking, and context management difficult to diagnose. This paper presents Jenius-Agent, a system-level agent framework grounded in real-world deployment experience. It integrates adaptive prompt generation, context-aware tool orchestration, and layered memory mechanism to stabilize execution and improve robustness in long-horizon, tool-augmented tasks. Beyond system design, we introduce an evaluation methodology that jointly measures procedural fidelity, semantic correctness, and efficiency. This framework makes agent behavior observable as a structured execution process and enables systematic analysis of failure modes not captured by output-only metrics. Experiments on Jenius-bench show substantial improvements in task completion rate, with up to a 35 percent relative gain over the base agent, along with reduced token consumption, response latency, and tool invocation failures. The framework is already deployed in Jenius ({https://www.jenius.cn}), providing a lightweight and scalable solution for robust, protocol-compatible autonomous agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: The size and capabilities of Earth-observing satellite constellations are rapidly increasing. Leveraging distributed onboard control, we can enable novel time-sensitive measurements and responses. However, deploying autonomy to large multiagent satellite systems necessitates algorithms with efficient computation and communication. We tackle this challenge and propose new, online algorithms for large-scale dynamic distributed constraint optimization problems (DDCOP). We present the Dynamic Multi-Satellite Constellation Observation Scheduling Problem (DCOSP), a new formulation of DDCOPs that models integrated scheduling and execution. We construct an omniscient offline algorithm to compute the novel optimality condition of DCOSP and present the Dynamic Incremental Neighborhood Stochastic Search (D-NSS) algorithm, an incomplete online decomposition-based DDCOP approach. We show through simulation that D-NSS converges to near-optimal solutions and outperforms DDCOP baselines in terms of solution quality, computation time, and message volume. Our work forms the foundation of the largest in-space demonstration of distributed multiagent AI to date: the NASA FAME mission.</p>

This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated remarkable potential, yet existing approaches remain largely proprietary and operate in batch-processing modes requiring hours per research cycle, precluding real-time researcher guidance. This paper introduces Deep Research, a multi-agent system enabling interactive scientific investigation with turnaround times measured in minutes. The architecture comprises specialized agents for planning, data analysis, literature search, and novelty detection, unified through a persistent world state that maintains context across iterative research cycles. Two operational modes support different workflows: semi-autonomous mode with selective human checkpoints, and fully autonomous mode for extended investigations. Evaluation on the BixBench computational biology benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 48.8% accuracy on open response and 64.4% on multiple-choice evaluation, exceeding existing baselines by 14 to 26 percentage points. Analysis of architectural constraints, including open access literature limitations and challenges inherent to automated novelty assessment, informs practical deployment considerations for AI-assisted scientific workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Liang, Satoshi Nakamura</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing dynamic Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks mostly place language models in a passive role: the model reads a sequence of connected scenarios and reports what people believe, feel, intend, and do as these states change. In real social interaction, ToM is also used for action: a speaker plans what to say in order to shift another person's mental-state trajectory toward a goal. We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance. This gap suggests that current LLMs still struggle to maintain and change mental-state representations across long, linked interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in knowledge representation and reasoning based on textual data. However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Lian, Bin Yu, Xiaopeng Lin, Laurence T. Yang, Zhaolong Shen, Changti Wu, Yuzhuo Miao, Cong Huang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinda Chen, Zhen Xing, Hanyu Zhang, Weimin Tan, Bo Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating data across various modalities. By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a massive influx of devices into the market, bringing with them significant security vulnerabilities. In this diverse ecosystem, robust IoT device identification is a critical preventive measure for network security and vulnerability management. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to identify IoT devices using the Aalto dataset. We employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify devices by converting network packet payloads into pseudo-images. Furthermore, we compare the performance of this payload-based approach against a feature-based fingerprinting method. Our results indicate that while the fingerprint-based method is significantly faster (approximately 10x), the payload-based image classification achieves comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-offs between computational efficiency and data granularity in IoT security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyuan Jiang, Moyang Guo, Yuepeng Hu, Yupu Wang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Several companies have deployed watermark-based detection to identify AI-generated content. However, attribution--the ability to trace back to the user of a generative AI (GenAI) service who created a given AI-generated content--remains largely unexplored despite its growing importance. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-level attribution of AI-generated content. Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance? To address the challenge, we first theoretically derive lower bounds on detection and attribution performance through rigorous probabilistic analysis for any given set of user watermarks. Then, we select watermarks for users to maximize these lower bounds, thereby optimizing detection and attribution performance. Our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based attribution inherits both the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the underlying watermark. Specifically, attribution remains highly accurate when the watermarked AI-generated content is either not post-processed or subjected to common post-processing such as JPEG compression, as well as black-box adversarial post-processing with limited query budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Jian, Curtis Wu, Danny Reidenbach, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenya Andrews, Lamogha Chiazor</p>
<p>Abstract: Injustices in text are often subtle since implicit biases or stereotypes frequently operate unconsciously due to the pervasive nature of prejudice in society. This makes automated detection of injustices more challenging which leads to them being often overlooked. We introduce a novel framework that combines knowledge from epistemology to enhance the detection of implicit injustices in text using NLP models to address these complexities and offer explainability. Our empirical study shows how our framework can be applied to effectively detect these injustices. We validate our framework using a human baseline study which mostly agrees with the choice of implicit bias, stereotype, and sentiment. The main feedback from the study was the extended time required to analyze, digest, and decide on each component of our framework. This highlights the importance of our automated framework pipeline that assists users in detecting implicit injustices while offering explainability and reducing time burdens on humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Chen, Le Xu, Wentse Chen, Jeff Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our "RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three challenging, stochastic tokamak control tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into editable features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations.

<p>Abstract: Game UI development is essential to the game industry. However, the traditional workflow requires substantial manual effort to integrate pairwise UI and UX designs into a cohesive game user interface (GameUI). The inconsistency between the aesthetic UI design and the functional UX design typically results in mismatches and inefficiencies. To address the issue, we present an automatic system, AutoGameUI, for efficiently and accurately constructing GameUI. The system centers on a two-stage multimodal learning pipeline to obtain the optimal correspondences between UI and UX designs. The first stage learns the comprehensive representations of UI and UX designs from multimodal perspectives. The second stage incorporates grouped cross-attention modules with constrained integer programming to estimate the optimal correspondences through top-down hierarchical matching. The optimal correspondences enable the automatic GameUI construction. We create the GAMEUI dataset, comprising pairwise UI and UX designs from real-world games, to train and validate the proposed method. Besides, an interactive web tool is implemented to ensure high-fidelity effects and facilitate human-in-the-loop construction. Extensive experiments on the GAMEUI and RICO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in maintaining consistency between the constructed GameUI and the original designs. When deployed in the workflow of several mobile games, AutoGameUI achieves a 3$\times$ improvement in time efficiency, conveying significant practical value for game UI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiejin Chen, Kaishen Wang, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking methods, which induce Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to output harmful responses, raise significant safety concerns. Among these methods, gradient-based approaches, which use gradients to generate malicious prompts, have been widely studied due to their high success rates in white-box settings, where full access to the model is available. However, these methods have notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always feasible, and involve high memory usage. To address scenarios where white-box access is unavailable, attackers often resort to transfer attacks. In transfer attacks, malicious inputs generated using white-box models are applied to black-box models, but this typically results in reduced attack performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Zer0-Jack, a method that bypasses the need for white-box access by leveraging zeroth-order optimization. We propose patch coordinate descent to efficiently generate malicious image inputs to directly attack black-box MLLMs, which significantly reduces memory usage further. Through extensive experiments, Zer0-Jack achieves a high attack success rate across various models, surpassing previous transfer-based methods and performing comparably with existing white-box jailbreak techniques. Notably, Zer0-Jack achieves a 95\% attack success rate on MiniGPT-4 with the Harmful Behaviors Multi-modal Dataset on a black-box setting, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, we show that Zer0-Jack can directly attack commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o. Codes are provided in the supplement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendong Liu, Yi Nian, Yuehan Qin, Henry Peng Zou, Li Li, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: How can models effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in complex, multi-label settings without extensive retraining? Existing OOD detection methods struggle to capture the intricate semantic relationships and label co-occurrences inherent in multi-label settings, often requiring large amounts of training data and failing to generalize to unseen label combinations. While large language models have revolutionized zero-shot OOD detection, they primarily focus on single-label scenarios, leaving a critical gap in handling real-world tasks where samples can be associated with multiple interdependent labels. To address these challenges, we introduce COOD, a novel zero-shot multi-label OOD detection framework. COOD leverages pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing them with a concept-based label expansion strategy and a new scoring function. By enriching the semantic space with both positive and negative concepts for each label, our approach models complex label dependencies, precisely differentiating OOD samples without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving approximately 95% average AUROC on both VOC and COCO datasets, while maintaining robust performance across varying numbers of labels and different types of OOD samples.</p>

However, catastrophic forgetting can severely impair model performance. In this study, we address network forgetting by introducing a novel framework termed Optimally-Weighted Maximum Mean Discrepancy (OWMMD), which imposes penalties on representation alterations via a Multi-Level Feature Matching Mechanism (MLFMM). Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Regularization Optimization (ARO) strategy to refine the adaptive weight vectors, which autonomously assess the significance of each feature layer throughout the optimization process, The proposed ARO approach can relieve the over-regularization problem and promote the future task learning. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, benchmarking our proposed method against several established baselines. The empirical findings indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marian Lupascu, Ana-Cristina Rogoz, Mihai Sorin Stupariu, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this survey, we systematically analyze techniques used to adapt large multimodal models (LMMs) for low-resource (LR) languages, examining approaches ranging from visual enhancement and data creation to cross-modal transfer and fusion strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of 117 studies across 96 LR languages, we identify key patterns in how researchers tackle the challenges of limited data and computational resources. We categorize works into resource-oriented and method-oriented contributions, further dividing contributions into relevant sub-categories. We compare method-oriented contributions in terms of performance and efficiency, discussing benefits and limitations of representative studies. We find that visual information often serves as a crucial bridge for improving model performance in LR settings, though significant challenges remain in areas such as hallucination mitigation and computational efficiency. In summary, we provide researchers with a clear understanding of current approaches and remaining challenges in making LMMs more accessible to speakers of LR (understudied) languages. We complement our survey with an open-source repository available at: https://github.com/marianlupascu/LMM4LRL-Survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghao Yang, Linye Lyu, Xuanhang Chang, Daojing He, YU LI</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have established themselves as powerful tools in the rapidly evolving field of image generation, capable of producing highly realistic images. However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns about copyright infringement and the misuse of generated content. Watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution, enabling copyright identification and misuse tracing through imperceptible markers embedded in generated images. Among these, latent-based watermarking techniques are particularly promising, as they embed watermarks directly into the latent noise without altering the underlying LDM architecture. In this work, we demonstrate that such latent-based watermarks are practically vulnerable to detection and compromise through systematic analysis of output images' statistical patterns for the first time. To counter this, we propose SWA-LDM (Stealthy Watermark for LDM), a lightweight framework that enhances stealth by dynamically randomizing the embedded watermarks using the Gaussian-distributed latent noise inherent to diffusion models. By embedding unique, pattern-free signatures per image, SWA-LDM eliminates detectable artifacts while preserving image quality and extraction robustness. Experiments demonstrate an average of 20% improvement in stealth over state-of-the-art methods, enabling secure deployment of watermarked generative AI in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kausik Lakkaraju, Rachneet Kaur, Parisa Zehtabi, Sunandita Patra, Zhen Zeng, Siva Likitha Valluru, Biplav Srivastava, Marco Valtorta</p>
<p>Abstract: AI models, including both time-series-specific and general-purpose Foundation Models (FMs), have demonstrated strong potential in time-series forecasting across sectors like finance. However, these models are highly sensitive to input perturbations, which can lead to prediction errors and undermine trust among stakeholders, including investors and analysts. To address this challenge, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to systematically evaluate model robustness by analyzing statistical and confounding biases under various noisy and erroneous input scenarios. Our framework is applied to a large-scale experimental setup involving stock price data from multiple industries and evaluates both uni-modal and multi-modal models, including Vision Transformer-based (ViT) models and FMs. We introduce six types of input perturbations and twelve data distributions to assess model performance. Results indicate that multi-modal and time-series-specific FMs demonstrate greater robustness and accuracy compared to general-purpose models. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing time-series models' prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirms that our ratings reduce the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different models. Our findings can help stakeholders understand model behaviors in terms of robustness and accuracy for better decision-making even without access to the model weights and training data, i.e., black-box settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijit Mishra, Mingda Li, Hsiang Fu, Richard Noh, Minji Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zetian Sun, Dongfang Li, Baotian Hu, Jun Yu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the Large Language Model(LLM) reasoning scenario, people often estimate state value via Monte Carlo sampling. Though Monte Carlo estimation is an elegant method with less inductive bias, noise and errors are inevitably introduced due to the limited sampling. To handle the problem, we inject the structural prior into the value representation and transfer the scalar value into the expectation of a pre-defined categorical distribution, representing the noise and errors from a distribution perspective. Specifically, by treating the result of Monte Carlo sampling as a single sample from the prior ground-truth Binomial distribution, we quantify the sampling error as the mismatch between posterior estimated distribution and ground-truth distribution, which is thus optimized via distribution selection optimization. We test the performance of value-based process verifiers on Best-of-N task and Beam search task. Compared with the scalar value representation, we show that reasonable structural prior injection induced by different objective functions or optimization methods can improve the performance of value-based process verifiers for about 1$\sim$2 points at little-to-no cost. We also show that under different structural prior, the verifiers' performances vary greatly despite having the same optimal solution, indicating the importance of reasonable structural prior injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaoyu Chen, Haoran Qin, Nuo Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Lei Xue, Xiapu Luo, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart contracts, predominantly written in Solidity and deployed on blockchains such as Ethereum, are immutable after deployment, making functional correctness critical. However, existing evaluations of Solidity code generation rely largely on surface-level metrics (e.g., BLEU, CrystalBLEU) or manual inspection, which correlate poorly with functional correctness. In contrast to Python, Solidity lacks large-scale, execution-based benchmarks, limiting systematic evaluation of large language models for smart contract development.
  We introduce SolBench, a comprehensive benchmark and automated testing pipeline for Solidity that emphasizes functional correctness via differential fuzzing. SolBench consists of 28825 functions extracted from 7604 real-world smart contracts collected from Etherscan (genesis-2024), spanning ten application domains. We benchmark 14 diverse LLMs, covering open and closed models, 1.3B-671B parameters, and both general-purpose and code-specialized architectures. The dominant failure mode is missing critical intra-contract information, such as state variables and type definitions. Providing full-contract context improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive inference costs.
  To address this, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Repair (RAR), a cost-effective framework that integrates execution feedback into code repair. RAR uses compiler and runtime error messages to retrieve only the minimal contract snippets needed to correct a target function, avoiding full-context inference. This significantly reduces input length while improving functional correctness. We further analyze retrieval and repair strategies within RAR, demonstrating consistent gains in accuracy and efficiency. SolBench and RAR enable principled, execution-based evaluation and economical improvement of Solidity code generation. Dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/ZaoyuChen/SolBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Bani-Harouni, Chantal Pellegrini, Paul Stangel, Ege \"Ozsoy, Kamilia Zaripova, Matthias Keicher, Nassir Navab</p>
<p>Abstract: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobuhiko Wakai, Satoshi Sato, Yasunori Ishii, Takayoshi Yamashita</p>
<p>Abstract: Person detection in overhead fisheye images is challenging due to person rotation and small persons. Prior work has mainly addressed person rotation, leaving the small-person problem underexplored. We remap fisheye images to equirectangular panoramas to handle rotation and exploit panoramic geometry to handle small persons more effectively. Conventional detection methods tend to favor larger persons because they dominate the attention maps, causing smaller persons to be missed. In hemispherical equirectangular panoramas, we find that apparent person height decreases approximately linearly with the vertical angle near the top of the image. Using this finding, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware tokenization to enhance the detection of small persons. This tokenization procedure divides panoramic features using self-similar figures that enable the determination of optimal divisions without gaps, and we leverage the maximum significance values in each tile of the token groups to preserve the significance areas of smaller persons. We propose a transformer-based person detection and localization method that combines panoramic-image remapping and the tokenization procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms conventional methods on large-scale datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzhi Li, Ethan Callanan, Abdellah Ghassel, Xiaodan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time compute methods can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities and problem-solving accuracy of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches require substantially more computational resources, with most compute wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these critical junctures tends to yield more diverse and higher-quality candidate reasoning steps. We propose Entropy-Gated Branching (EGB), which branches only at high-uncertainty steps and prunes expansions with a lightweight verifier. On mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks, EGB improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 31%-75% faster across math benchmarks than test-time beam search with higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI applications increasingly run on fast-evolving, heterogeneous hardware to maximize performance, but general-purpose libraries lag in supporting these features. Performance-minded programmers often build custom communication stacks that are fast but error-prone and non-portable.
  This paper introduces MSCCL++, a design methodology for developing high-performance, portable communication kernels. It provides (1) a low-level, performance-preserving primitive interface that exposes minimal hardware abstractions while hiding the complexities of synchronization and consistency, (2) a higher-level DSL for application developers to implement workload-specific communication algorithms, and (3) a library of efficient algorithms implementing the standard collective API, enabling adoption by users with minimal expertise.
  Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, MSCCL++ achieves geomean speedups of $1.7\times$ (up to $5.4\times$) for collective communication and $1.2\times$ (up to $1.38\times$) for AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is in production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and has also been adopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD. MSCCL++ is open source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/mscclpp . Our two years of experience with MSCCL++ suggests that its abstractions are robust, enabling support for new hardware features, such as multimem, within weeks of development.</p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dzung Pham, Peter Kairouz, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Eugene Bagdasarian, Chau Minh Pham, Amir Houmansadr</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in privacy pipelines to detect and remedy sensitive data leakage. These solutions often rely on the premise that LLMs can reliably recognize human names, one of the most important categories of personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we reveal how LLMs can consistently mishandle broad classes of human names even in short text snippets due to ambiguous linguistic cues in the contexts. We construct AmBench, a benchmark of over 12,000 real yet ambiguous human names based on the name regularity bias phenomenon. Each name appears in dozens of concise text snippets that are compatible with multiple entity types. Our experiments with 12 state-of-the-art LLMs show that the recall of AmBench names drops by 20--40% compared to more recognizable names. This uneven privacy protection due to linguistic properties raises important concerns about the fairness of privacy enforcement. When the contexts contain benign prompt injections -- instruction-like user texts that can cause LLMs to conflate data with commands -- AmBench names can become four times more likely to be ignored in Clio, an LLM-powered enterprise tool used by Anthropic AI to extract supposedly privacy-preserving insights from user conversations with Claude. Our findings showcase blind spots in the performance and fairness of LLM-based privacy solutions and call for a systematic investigation into their privacy failure modes and countermeasures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrej Schwanke, Lyubomir Ivanov, David Salinas, Fabio Ferreira, Aaron Klein, Frank Hutter, Arber Zela</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as effective surrogate models and candidate generators within global optimization frameworks for expensive blackbox functions. Despite promising results, LLM-based methods often struggle in high-dimensional search spaces or when lacking domain-specific priors, leading to sparse or uninformative suggestions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOLLM, a novel global optimization algorithm that enhances LLM-driven sampling by partitioning the search space into promising subregions. Each subregion acts as a ``meta-arm'' selected via a bandit-inspired scoring mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Within each selected subregion, an LLM then proposes high-quality candidate points, without any explicit domain knowledge. Empirical evaluation on standard optimization benchmarks shows that HOLLM consistently matches or surpasses leading global optimization methods, while substantially outperforming global LLM-based sampling strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Wang, Lu Wang, Chaoyun Zhang, Tianjun Mao, Si Qin, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answers while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results suggest that natural-language feedback can serve not only as explanations, but also as actionable training signals for fine-grained alignment. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cody Kommers, Drew Hemment, Maria Antoniak, Joel Z. Leibo, Hoyt Long, Emily Robinson, Adam Sobey</p>
<p>Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin descriptions (numerical representations that enforce standardization and therefore strip human activity of the cultural context which gives it meaning). By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description (verbal representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual information needed to represent human meaning). The verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of at least partially automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, offering new ways to deploy them at scale. We argue that the problem of rendering human meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics but about developing new representational formats based on thick description. We frame this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism, integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance, distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> TaeJun Ha, Chaehyun Jung, Hyeonuk Kim, Jeongwoo Park, Jeonghun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing-based approaches, such as linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a model-based DNN framework that learns the linear MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE performs channel estimation through a single linear operation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To improve the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder that captures the frequency and temporal correlation structure of OFDM channels. We also introduce a rank-adaptive extension that enables a flexible performance-complexity trade-off. Numerical simulations show that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension provide an improved performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful and highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raj Patel, Himanshu Tripathi, Jasper Stone, Noorbakhsh Amiri Golilarz, Sudip Mittal, Shahram Rahimi, Vini Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has driven organizations across diverse sectors to seek efficient and reliable methods to accelerate model development-to-deployment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as an integrative approach addressing these requirements by unifying relevant roles and streamlining ML workflows. As the MLOps market continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly critical. However, the unified nature of MLOps ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to adversarial attacks where a single misconfiguration can lead to compromised credentials, severe financial losses, damaged public trust, and the poisoning of training data. Our paper presents a systematic application of the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework, supplemented by reviews of white and grey literature, to systematically assess attacks across different phases of the MLOps ecosystem. We begin by reviewing prior work in this domain, then present our taxonomy and introduce a threat model that captures attackers with different knowledge and capabilities. We then present a structured taxonomy of attack techniques explicitly mapped to corresponding phases of the MLOps ecosystem, supported by examples drawn from red-teaming exercises and real-world incidents. This is followed by a taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with these attack categories, offering actionable early-stage defenses to strengthen the security of MLOps ecosystem. Given the gradual evolution and adoption of MLOps, we further highlight key research gaps that require immediate attention. Our work emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols from the outset, empowering practitioners to safeguard MLOps ecosystem against evolving cyber attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyi Zhu, Xiaoyu Wu, Zihao Liu, Linlin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However, for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden labels and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally, we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 4 Sonnet-based assistant. The resulting assistant matches its counterpart trained on production-grade human labels on average, with higher scores on chat and safety yet lower scores on math and coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Liu, Yubin Li, Guozhang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits. Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable directions within this space directly relate to understandable network properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Bani-Harouni, Chantal Pellegrini, Ege \"Ozsoy, Matthias Keicher, Nassir Navab</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizheng Zhang, Michael Wornow, Gerry Wan, Kunle Olukotun</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based agent applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs and latency due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agent applications where outputs depend on external data and environmental contexts. We propose Agentic Plan Caching (APC), a novel test-time memory that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agent applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost and latency of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agent applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 50.31% and latency by 27.28% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Momin Ahmad Khan, Yasra Chandio, Fatima Muhammad Anwar</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning has emerged as a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving paradigm for adapting large vision-language models like CLIP across decentralized clients. However, the security implications of this setup remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first study of backdoor attacks in Federated Prompt Learning. We show that when malicious clients inject visually imperceptible, learnable noise triggers into input images, the global prompt learner becomes vulnerable to targeted misclassification while still maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. Motivated by this vulnerability, we propose SABRE-FL, a lightweight, modular defense that filters poisoned prompt updates using an embedding-space anomaly detector trained offline on out-of-distribution data. SABRE-FL requires no access to raw client data or labels and generalizes across diverse datasets. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that malicious clients can be reliably identified and filtered using an embedding-based detector. Across five diverse datasets and four baseline defenses, SABRE-FL outperforms all baselines by significantly reducing backdoor accuracy while preserving clean accuracy, demonstrating strong empirical performance and underscoring the need for robust prompt learning in future federated systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Razin, Yong Lin, Jiarui Yao, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Overall, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Rodriguez-Garcia, Anindya Ghosh, Srikanth Ramaswamy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the stability gap -- a temporary performance drop on previously learned tasks when new ones are introduced. This phenomenon reflects a mismatch between rapid adaptation and strong retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need for optimization mechanisms that balance plasticity and stability over abrupt distribution changes. While optimizers such as momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit multi-timescale behavior, they still exhibit pronounced stability gaps. Importantly, these gaps persist even under ideal joint training, making it crucial to study them in this setting to isolate their causes from other sources of forgetting. Motivated by how noradrenergic (neuromodulatory) bursts transiently increase neuronal gain under uncertainty, we introduce a dynamic gain scaling mechanism as a two-timescale optimization technique that balances adaptation and retention by modulating effective learning rates and flattening the local landscape through an effective reparameterization. Across domain- and class-incremental MNIST, CIFAR, and mini-ImageNet benchmarks under task-agnostic joint training, dynamic gain scaling effectively attenuates stability gaps while maintaining competitive accuracy, improving robustness at task transitions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vipin Singh, Teodor Chiaburu, Einar Eberhardt, Stefan Broda, Joey Pr\"ussing, Frank Hau{\ss}er, Felix Bie{\ss}mann</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular foundation models, have improved the state of the art in many application domains including geosciences. Some specific problems, however, could not benefit from this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil condition. In this work, we propose \textit{SoilNet} - a multimodal multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized pipeline. In contrast to omnipurpose AI foundation models, our approach is designed to be inherently transparent by following the task structure human experts developed for solving this challenging annotation task. The proposed approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates. Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world soil profile dataset and a comprehensive user study with domain experts. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SoilNet reliably predicts soil horizons that are plausible and accurate. User study results indicate that SoilNet achieves predictive performance on par with or better than that of human experts. All code can be found at: https://github.com/calgo-lab/BGR/</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems. Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy. The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Liang, Zhihao Xu, Jiaqi Weng, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue, Xiting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. To mitigate these risks, existing detection methods are essential, yet they face two major challenges: generalization and accuracy. While learning-based methods trained on specific attacks fail to generalize to unseen attacks, learning-free methods based on hand-crafted heuristics suffer from limited accuracy and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a learnable framework that eliminates the need for any attack data or hand-crafted heuristics. LoD operates by first extracting layer-wise safety representations directly from the model's internal activations using Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors classifiers, and then converting the high-dimensional representations into a one-dimensional anomaly score for detection via a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoD consistently achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (AUROC) across diverse unseen jailbreak attacks on multiple LVLMs, while also significantly improving efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhou, Yu-Jie Xiong, Jia-Chen Zhang, Chun-Ming Xia, Xihe Qiu, Hongjian Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced Novel View Synthesis (NVS) through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS) to address these challenges. Our key innovations: the Gradient Coherence Ratio (GCR), computed through normalized gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control. Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact scene representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical for timely intervention, yet most diagnoses are delayed until advanced stages. While comprehensive patient narratives are essential for accurate diagnosis, prior work has largely focused on screening studies that classify cognitive status from interactions rather than supporting the diagnostic process. We designed voice-interactive conversational agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs), to elicit narratives relevant to ADRD from patients and informants. We evaluated the agent with 30 adults with suspected ADRD through conversation analysis, user surveys, and analysis of symptom elicitation compared to blinded specialist interviews. Symptoms detected by the agent showed promising agreement with those identified by specialists. Users appreciated the agent's patience and systematic questioning, which supported engagement and expression of complex, hard-to-describe experiences. While these findings suggest potential for conversational agents as structured diagnostic support tools, further validation with larger samples and assessment of clinical utility is needed before deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) addresses the challenge of detecting and removing landmines from conflict regions. Much of the life-saving operational knowledge produced by HMA agencies is buried in unstructured reports, limiting the transferability of information between agencies. To address this issue, we propose TextMineX: the first dataset, evaluation framework and ontology-guided large language model (LLM) pipeline for knowledge extraction from text in the HMA domain. TextMineX structures HMA reports into (subject, relation, object)-triples, thus creating domain-specific knowledge. To ensure real-world relevance, we utilized the dataset from our collaborator Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC). We further introduce a bias-aware evaluation framework that combines human-annotated triples with an LLM-as-Judge protocol to mitigate position bias in reference-free scoring. Our experiments show that ontology-aligned prompts improve extraction accuracy by up to 44.2%, reduce hallucinations by 22.5%, and enhance format adherence by 20.9% compared to baseline models. We publicly release the dataset and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Lee, Ziming Liu, Xinling Yu, Yixuan Wang, Haewon Jeong, Murphy Yuezhen Niu, Zheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics (variable coefficient PDEs) for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeonsun Yang, Sang Won Lee, Jean Y. Song, Sangdoo Yun, Young-Ho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-native English speakers performing English-related tasks at work struggle to sustain EFL learning, despite their motivation. Often, study materials are disconnected from their work context. Our formative study revealed that reviewing work-related English becomes burdensome with current systems, especially after work. Although workers rely on LLM-based assistants to address their immediate needs, these interactions may not directly contribute to their English skills. We present LingoQ, an AI-mediated system that allows workers to practice English using quizzes generated from their LLM queries during work. LingoQ leverages these on-the-fly queries using AI to generate personalized quizzes that workers can review and practice on their smartphones. We conducted a three-week deployment study with 28 EFL workers to evaluate LingoQ. Participants valued the quality-assured, work-situated quizzes and constantly engaging with the app during the study. This active engagement improved self-efficacy and led to learning gains for beginners and, potentially, for intermediate learners. Drawing on these results, we discuss design implications for leveraging workers' growing reliance on LLMs to foster proficiency and engagement while respecting work boundaries and ethics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayun Choi, Jung-Woo Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in target sound extraction (TSE) utilize directional clues derived from direction of arrival (DoA), which represent an inherent spatial property of sound available in any acoustic scene. However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liang, Zhaoqi Huang, Haofen Wang, Fu Chai, Chunying Yu, Huanhuan Wei, Zhengjie Liu, Yanpeng Li, Hongjun Wang, Ruifeng Luo, Xianzhong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark features a five-level, cognition-oriented evaluation framework (i.e., Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application). Based on the framework, 23 representative evaluation tasks were defined. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an "LLM-as-a-Judge" approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honglin Zhang, Qianyue Hao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families and mathematical datasets shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in average activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in mathematical generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Cao, Yang Liu, Longhan Zhang, Yifan Wu, Zhixun Li, Yuyu Luo, Hong Cheng, Yang Ren, Tong-Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lute Lillo, Nick Cheney</p>
<p>Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Wang, Kaixuan Zhang, Wanfang Chen, Xiaonan Lu, Longyuan Li, Tobias Schlagenhauf</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanshu Zhang, Lei Kang, Sawyer D. Campbell, Douglas H. Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional metasurface design is limited by the computational cost of full-wave simulations, preventing thorough exploration of complex configurations. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast, sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However, applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic modelling, this "chat-to-chip" workflow represents a step toward more user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyeop Song, Song Wang, Julian Shun, Yada Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality remains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the form of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective metrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce SingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on our preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro extends the annotations of the additional data to include lyrics, melody, and overall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset contains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets, spanning from early systems to recent state-of-the-art approaches. Each clip is rated by at least five experienced annotators to ensure reliability and consistency. Furthermore, we investigate strategies for effectively utilizing MOS data annotated under heterogeneous standards and benchmark several widely used evaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong baselines and practical references for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc Kieu, Kien Do, Tuan Hoang, Thao Minh Le, Tung Kieu, Dang Nguyen, Thin Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleg Filatov, Jiangtao Wang, Jan Ebert, Stefan Kesselheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. For Adam and Scion optimizers, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and dataset sizes is conditioned on a single invariant: the operator norm of the output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are consistent with those of Adam. Tuning per-layer-group learning rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support research on LLM training dynamics at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikai Huang, Jieyu Zhang, Taoyang Jia, Chenhao Zheng, Ziqi Gao, Jae Sung Park, Winson Han, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized through tasks such as instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- enables applications ranging from robotic perception to photo editing. These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions.
  Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios.
  Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</p>

The method introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization operator that can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajat Bhattacharjya, Woohyeok Park, Arnab Sarkar, Hyunwoo Oh, Mohsen Imani, Nikil Dutt</p>
<p>Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off, as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems. We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and "black-box" nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abdullah Al Mazid, Liangdong Deng, Naphtali Rishe</p>
<p>Abstract: Clouds remain a major obstacle in optical satellite imaging, limiting accurate environmental and climate analysis. To address the strong spectral variability and the large scale differences among cloud types, we propose MSCloudCAM, a novel multi-scale context adapter network with convolution based cross-attention tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. A key contribution of MSCloudCAM is the explicit modeling of multiple complementary multi-scale context extractors. And also, rather than simply stacking or concatenating their outputs, our formulation uses one extractor's fine-resolution features and the other extractor's global contextual representations enabling dynamic, scale-aware feature selection. Building on this idea, we design a new convolution-based cross attention adapter that effectively fuses localized, detailed information with broader multi-scale context. Integrated with a hierarchical vision backbone and refined through channel and spatial attention mechanisms, MSCloudCAM achieves strong spectral-spatial discrimination. Experiments on various multisensor datatsets e.g. CloudSEN12 (Sentinel-2) and L8Biome (Landsat-8), demonstrate that MSCloudCAM achieves superior overall segmentation performance and competitive class-wise accuracy compared to recent state-of-the-art models, while maintaining competitive model complexity, highlighting the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed design for large-scale Earth observation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tieyuan Chen, Xiaodong Chen, Haoxing Chen, Zhenzhong Lan, Weiyao Lin, Jianguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer, DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by 0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Jiaming Zhang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is typically optimized for topical relevance, yet its success ultimately depends on whether retrieved passages are useful for a large language model (LLM) to generate correct and complete answers. We argue that such utility is often LLM-specific rather than universal, due to differences in models' knowledge, reasoning, and ability to leverage evidence. We formalize LLM-specific utility as the performance improvement of a target LLM when a passage is provided, compared to answering without evidence. To systematically study LLM-specific utility, we construct a benchmark of LLM-specific gold utilitarian passages for four LLMs (Qwen3-8B/14B/32B and Llama3.1-8B) on three QA datasets (Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and MS MARCO-FQA). Our analysis shows that utilitarian passages are model-dependent and non-transferable: each LLM performs best with its own utilitarian evidence, while evidence optimized for other LLMs is consistently suboptimal. Human-annotated evidence remains a strong general baseline but does not fully match individual LLM utility needs. We further introduce the LLM-specific utility judgment task and find that existing utility-aware selection and scoring methods largely capture model-agnostic usefulness and struggle to reliably estimate LLM-specific utility. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of current utility-aware retrieval and motivate generator-tailored evidence selection for improving RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao He, Huangxuan Zhao, Guojia Wan, Wei Zhou, Yanxing Liu, Juhua Liu, Yongchao Xu, Yong Luo, Dacheng Tao, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Gupta, Qiankun Zhong, Hiromu Yakura, Thomas Eisenmann, Iyad Rahwan</p>
<p>Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with LLMs explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without explicit knowledge of the payoff structure or how individual actions translate into long-run outcomes, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and enforcement. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Zhang, Xianliang Yang, Juwon Yu, Park Cheonyoung, Miran Lee, Lei Song, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a principled, resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional finetuning. We define the resulting estimate as the ICA score, and derive per-example weights that dynamically reweight gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score update frequency and the number of in-context holdout examples. We also discuss limitations in rapidly drifting on-policy settings, highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Qiao, Xing Liu, Wenke Huang, Jianbin Li, Zhaoxin Fan, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity. We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions. Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Ray, Vera Galinova, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkang Liu, Fanhua Shang, Hongying Liu, Yuxuan Tian, Yuanyuan Liu, Jin Liu, Kewen Zhu, Zhouchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy. The code is available in https://github.com/junkangLiu0/FedAdamW.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Munib Mesinovic, Max Buhlan, Tingting Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Di Noia, Federico Ravenda, Antonietta Mira</p>
<p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanchaita Hazra, Doeun Lee, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Sachin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have seen expanding application across domains, yet their effectiveness as assistive tools for scientific writing - an endeavor requiring precision, multimodal synthesis, and domain expertise - remains insufficiently understood. We examine the potential of LLMs to support domain experts in scientific writing, with a focus on abstract composition. We design an incentivized randomized controlled trial with a hypothetical conference setup where participants with relevant expertise are split into an author and reviewer pool. Inspired by methods in behavioral science, our novel incentive structure encourages authors to edit the provided abstracts to an acceptable quality for a peer-reviewed submission. Our 2 x 2 between-subject design expands into two dimensions: the implicit source of the provided abstract and the disclosure of it. We find authors make most edits when editing human-written abstracts compared to AI-generated abstracts without source attribution, often guided by higher perceived readability in AI generation. Upon disclosure of source information, the volume of edits converges in both source treatments. Reviewer decisions remain unaffected by the source of the abstract, but bear a significant correlation with the number of edits made. Careful stylistic edits, especially in the case of AI-generated abstracts, in the presence of source information, improve the chance of acceptance. We find that AI-generated abstracts hold potential to reach comparable levels of acceptability to human-written ones with minimal revision, and that perceptions of AI authorship, rather than objective quality, drive much of the observed editing behavior. Our findings reverberate the significance of source disclosure in collaborative scientific writing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Shi, Hongnan Ma, Mengyue Yang, Cunjia Liu, Weiru Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In emergency response and other high-stakes societal applications, early-stage state estimates critically shape downstream outcomes. Yet, these initial state estimates-often based on limited or biased information-can be severely misaligned with reality, constraining subsequent actions and potentially causing catastrophic delays, resource misallocation, and human harm. Under the stationary bootstrap baseline (zero transition and no rejuvenation), bootstrap particle filters exhibit Stationarity-Induced Posterior Support Invariance (S-PSI), wherein regions excluded by the initial prior remain permanently unexplorable, making corrections impossible even when new evidence contradicts current beliefs. While classical perturbations can in principle break this lock-in, they operate in an always-on fashion and may be inefficient. To overcome this, we propose a diffusion-driven Bayesian exploration framework that enables principled, real-time correction of early state estimation errors. Our method expands posterior support via entropy-regularized sampling and covariance-scaled diffusion. A Metropolis-Hastings check validates proposals and keeps inference adaptive to unexpected evidence. Empirical evaluations on realistic hazardous-gas localization tasks show that our approach matches reinforcement learning and planning baselines when priors are correct. It substantially outperforms classical SMC perturbations and RL-based methods under misalignment, and we provide theoretical guarantees that DEPF resolves S-PSI while maintaining statistical rigor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Lu, Shamim Nemati</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in intensive care units (ICUs) patients is crucial for timely interventions and resource allocation. However, variability in patient populations, clinical practices, and electronic health record (EHR) systems across institutions introduces domain shifts that degrade the generalization performance of predictive models during deployment. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such shifts by adapting models dynamically during inference without requiring labeled target-domain data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task. Additionally, to improve robustness against domain shifts, we incorporate prototype learning and employ Partial Optimal Transport (POT) for flexible, partial feature alignment while maintaining clinically meaningful patient representations. Experiments across multi-center ICU cohorts demonstrate competitive classification performance on different test-time adaptation benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Tacheny</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative LLM systems(self-refinement, chain-of-thought, autonomous agents) are increasingly deployed, yet their temporal dynamics remain uncharacterized. Prior work evaluates task performance at convergence but ignores the trajectory: how does semantic content evolve across iterations? Does it stabilize, drift, or oscillate? Without answering these questions, we cannot predict system behavior, guarantee stability, or systematically design iterative architectures.
  We formalize agentic loops as discrete dynamical systems in semantic space. Borrowing from dynamical systems theory, we define trajectories, attractors and dynamical regimes for recursive LLM transformations, providing rigorous geometric definitions adapted to this setting. Our framework reveals that agentic loops exhibit classifiable dynamics: contractive (convergence toward stable semantic attractors), oscillatory (cycling among attractors), or exploratory (unbounded divergence).
  Experiments on singular loops validate the framework. Iterative paraphrasing produces contractive dynamics with measurable attractor formation and decreasing dispersion. Iterative negation produces exploratory dynamics with no stable structure. Crucially, prompt design directly controls the dynamical regime - the same model exhibits fundamentally different geometric behaviors depending solely on the transformation applied.
  This work establishes that iterative LLM dynamics are predictable and controllable, opening new directions for stability analysis, trajectory forecasting, and principled design of composite loops that balance convergence and exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Yanjiang Liu, Hongyu Lin, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yaojie Lu, Debing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning has achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, it is constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the probabilities that LLMs generate reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \textit{\b{Co}upled \b{V}ariational \b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehil B Shah, Mohammad Masudur Rahman, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaokang Jiang, Daye Nam</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.
  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikun Guo, Adeyinka. P. Adedigba, Rammohan Mallipeddi</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic appliance data are essential for developing non-intrusive load monitoring algorithms and enabling privacy preserving energy research, yet the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a significant barrier. Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sofie Goethals, Foster Provost, Jo\~ao Sedoc</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The dataset spans diverse artistic styles, including regionally grounded aesthetics from the Middle East, Northern Europe, East Asia, and South Asia, alongside general categories such as sketch and oil painting. All images are generated using the Moonworks Lunara model and intentionally crafted to embody distinct, high-quality aesthetic styles, yielding a first-of-its-kind dataset with substantially higher aesthetic scores, exceeding even aesthetics-focused datasets, and general-purpose datasets by a larger margin. Each image is accompanied by a human-refined prompt and structured annotations that jointly describe salient objects, attributes, relationships, and stylistic cues. Unlike large-scale web-derived datasets that emphasize breadth over precision, the Lunara Aesthetic Dataset prioritizes aesthetic quality, stylistic diversity, and licensing transparency, and is released under the Apache 2.0 license to support research and unrestricted academic and commercial use.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work proposes a contextualised detection framework for implicitly hateful speech, implemented as a multi-agent system comprising a central Moderator Agent and dynamically constructed Community Agents representing specific demographic groups. Our approach explicitly integrates socio-cultural context from publicly available knowledge sources, enabling identity-aware moderation that surpasses state-of-the-art prompting methods (zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting) and alternative approaches on a challenging ToxiGen dataset. We enhance the technical rigour of performance evaluation by incorporating balanced accuracy as a central metric of classification fairness that accounts for the trade-off between true positive and true negative rates. We demonstrate that our community-driven consultative framework significantly improves both classification accuracy and fairness across all target groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-han Li, Shenghui Chen, Ufuk Topcu, Sandeep Chinchali</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niva Manchanda, Akshata Kishore Moharir, Isabel Michel, Ratna Kandala</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to provide support and advice in personal domains such as romantic relationships, yet little is known about user perceptions of this type of advice. This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Kuzmin, Songting Liu, Kong Aik Lee, Eng Siong Chng</p>
<p>Abstract: Protecting speaker identity is crucial for online voice applications, yet streaming speaker anonymization (SA) remains underexplored. Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has increased the need for reliable AI text detection, yet existing detectors often fail outside controlled benchmarks. We systematically evaluate 2 dominant paradigms (training-free and supervised) and show that both are brittle under distribution shift, unseen generators, and simple stylistic perturbations. To address these limitations, we propose a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework that learns discriminative style embeddings. Experiments show that while supervised detectors excel in-domain, they degrade sharply out-of-domain, and training-free methods remain highly sensitive to proxy choice. Overall, our results expose fundamental challenges in building domain-agnostic detectors. Our code is available at: https://github.com/HARSHITJAIS14/DetectAI</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, XueHeng Li, Yu Wang, XuanHua He, ZhangChi Hu, WeiWei Yu, ChengJun Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingren Hou, Hong Wang, Pengyu Xu, Chang Gao, Huafeng Liu, Liping Jing</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world scientific applications frequently encounter incomplete observational data due to sensor limitations, geographic constraints, or measurement costs. Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator(LANO) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. LANO achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction. Our approach effectively addresses practical scenarios involving up to 75$\%$ missing rate, to some extent bridging the existing gap between idealized research settings and the complexities of real-world scientific computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitao He, Zongwei Lyu, Yi R Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Farrell</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether professional translators can reliably identify short stories generated in Italian by artificial intelligence (AI) without prior specialized training. Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Yang, Jianchao Tang, Zhuo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: People's transportation choices reflect complex trade-offs shaped by personal preferences, social norms, and technology acceptance. Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly acting as autonomous contributors by generating and submitting pull requests (PRs). However, we lack empirical evidence on how these agent-generated PRs differ from human contributions, particularly in how they modify code and describe their changes. Understanding these differences is essential for assessing their reliability and impact on development workflows. Using the MSR 2026 Mining Challenge version of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 24,014 merged Agentic PRs (440,295 commits) and 5,081 merged Human PRs (23,242 commits). We examine additions, deletions, commits, and files touched, and evaluate the consistency between PR descriptions and their diffs using lexical and semantic similarity. Agentic PRs differ substantially from Human PRs in commit count (Cliff's $\delta = 0.5429$) and show moderate differences in files touched and deleted lines. They also exhibit slightly higher description-to-diff similarity across all measures. These findings provide a large-scale empirical characterization of how AI coding agents contribute to open source development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Al-Lawati, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing adoption of multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) pipelines for vision-centric tasks (e.g. visual QA) introduces important privacy challenges. In particular, while mRAG provides a practical capability to connect private datasets to improve model performance, it risks the leakage of private information from these datasets during inference. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to analyze the privacy risks inherent in the mRAG pipeline observed through standard model prompting. Specifically, we implement a case study that attempts to infer the inclusion of a visual asset, e.g. image, in the mRAG, and if present leak the metadata, e.g. caption, related to it. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms and motivate future research on mRAG privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Mu, Xin He, Qu Yang, Wanshun Chen, Jiadi Yao, Huang Liu, Zihao Yi, Bo Zhao, Xingyu Chen, Ruotian Ma, Fanghua Ye, Erkun Yang, Cheng Deng, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaolong Li,  Linus</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Song, Xinyu Gong, Bangya Liu, Zelin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Subject-to-Video Generation (S2V) methods have achieved high-fidelity and subject-consistent video generation, yet remain constrained to single-view subject references. This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyi Liu, Mohammad Khalil, Naman Goel</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, such as the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), are pre-trained on a massive number of synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCM). They leverage in-context learning to offer high predictive accuracy in real-world tasks. However, the fairness properties of these foundational models, which incorporate ideas from causal reasoning during pre-training, remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts. Our results reveal that while TabPFN achieves stronger predictive accuracy compared to baselines and exhibits robustness to spurious correlations, improvements in fairness are moderate and inconsistent, particularly under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) covariate shifts. These findings suggest that the causal pre-training in TabPFN is helpful but insufficient for algorithmic fairness, highlighting implications for deploying TabPFN (and similar) models in practice and the need for further fairness interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyu Xiao, Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Yong Luo, Jia Liu, Jie Xu, Han Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

<p>Abstract: Recently, the frontier of Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities has shifted from single-turn code generation to agentic software engineering-a paradigm where models autonomously navigate, edit, and test complex repositories. While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B). Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve **56.1%** and **58.5%** resolution rates, respectively, which are ...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ignacio Antequera-S\'anchez, Juan Luis Su\'arez-D\'iaz, Rosana Montes, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.</p>
