<p><b>Authors:</b> Honglin Lin, Chonghan Qin, Zheng Liu, Qizhi Pei, Yu Li, Zhanping Zhong, Xin Gao, Yanfeng Wang, Conghui He, Lijun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: While synthetic data has proven effective for improving scientific reasoning in the text domain, multimodal reasoning remains constrained by the difficulty of synthesizing scientifically rigorous images. Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit "understand - plan - code" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Xu, Fuquan Zong, Yexuan Xing, Chulong Zhang, Guang Yang, Shilong Yang, Xiaokun Liang, Juan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of medical image segmentation is increasingly defined by the efficiency of data utilization rather than merely the volume of raw data. Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology. Comprehensive experiments on a hybrid dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the data efficiency and robustness of state-of-the-art models, including nnU-Net and U-Mamba, offering a potent strategy for high-performance medical image analysis with limited annotation budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wilkie Delgado-Font, Miriela Escobedo-Nicot, Manuel Gonz\'alez-Hidalgo, Silena Herold-Garcia, Antoni Jaume-i-Cap\'o, Arnau Mir</p>
<p>Abstract: Red blood cell (RBC) deformation is the consequence of several diseases, including sickle cell anemia, which causes recurring episodes of pain and severe pronounced anemia. Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures. The results achieved by the proposed method are suitable for the purpose of clinical treatment and diagnostic support of sickle cell anemia.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aahana Basappa, Pranay Goel, Anusri Karra, Anish Karra, Asa Gilmore, Kevin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigated visual reasoning limitations of both multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) by creating a novel benchmark to systematically compare failure modes across image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, enabling cross-modal evaluation of visual understanding. Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Obai Alashram, Nejad Alagha, Mahmoud AlKakuri, Zeeshan Swaveel, Abigail Copiaco</p>
<p>Abstract: The construction industry produces significant volumes of debris, making effective sorting and classification critical for sustainable waste management and resource recovery. This study presents a hybrid vision-based pipeline that integrates deep feature extraction with classical machine learning (ML) classifiers for automated construction and demolition (C\&D) debris classification. A novel dataset comprising 1,800 balanced, high-quality images representing four material categories, Ceramic/Tile, Concrete, Trash/Waste, and Wood was collected from real construction sites in the UAE, capturing diverse real-world conditions. Deep features were extracted using a pre-trained Xception network, and multiple ML classifiers, including SVM, kNN, Bagged Trees, LDA, and Logistic Regression, were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrate that hybrid pipelines using Xception features with simple classifiers such as Linear SVM, kNN, and Bagged Trees achieve state-of-the-art performance, with up to 99.5\% accuracy and macro-F1 scores, surpassing more complex or end-to-end deep learning approaches. The analysis highlights the operational benefits of this approach for robust, field-deployable debris identification and provides pathways for future integration with robotics and onsite automation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyuk Heo, Beomkyu Choi, Hyunjin Shin, Darongsae Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Mangroves are critical for climate-change mitigation, requiring reliable monitoring for effective conservation. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for mangrove detection, its progress is hindered by the limitations of existing datasets. In particular, many resources provide only annual map products without curated single-date image-mask pairs, limited to specific regions rather than global coverage, or remain inaccessible to the public. To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings. We also provide a benchmark across diverse semantic segmentation architectures under a country-disjoint split, establishing a foundation for scalable and reliable global mangrove monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H Neji, J Nogueras-Iso, J Lacasta, M\'A Latre, FJ Garc\'ia-Marco</p>
<p>Abstract: The transcription of historical documents written in Latin in XV and XVI centuries has special challenges as it must maintain the characters and special symbols that have distinct meanings to ensure that historical texts retain their original style and significance. This work proposes a pipeline for the transcription of historical documents preserving these special features. We propose to extend an existing text line recognition method with a layout analysis model. We analyze historical text images using a layout analysis model to extract text lines, which are then processed by an OCR model to generate a fully digitized page. We showed that our pipeline facilitates the processing of the page and produces an efficient result. We evaluated our approach on multiple datasets and demonstrate that the masked autoencoder effectively processes different types of text, including handwritten, printed and multi-language.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17041">Arabic Sign Language Recognition using Multimodal Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadeer Alanazi, Abir Benabid</p>
<p>Abstract: Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) is an essential communication method for individuals in the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%. These results offer preliminary insights into the viability of multimodal fusion for sign language recognition and highlight areas for further optimization and dataset expansion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyuan Liu, Libin Hou, Linyuan Wang, Bin Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR2)-driven white-box transformer, grounded in structured representation learning, unifies interpretability and efficiency, providing a reliable white-box solution for visual modeling. However, in existing designs, tight coupling between "membership matrix" and "subspace matrix U" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the "membership matrix" and "subspaces U" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Compared with vanilla Transformer architectures, DMST exhibits significantly higher computational efficiency and interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for extracting 3D atomic-level information from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images affected by significant noise. The approach is based on formulating depth estimation as a semantic segmentation problem. We address the resulting segmentation problem by training a deep convolutional neural network to generate pixel-wise depth segmentation maps using simulated data corrupted by synthetic noise. The proposed method was applied to estimate the depth of atomic columns in CeO2 nanoparticles from simulated images and real-world TEM data. Our experiments show that the resulting depth estimates are accurate, calibrated and robust to noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanjie Gu, Yiqun Wang, Chaohui Yu, Ang Xuan, Fan Wang, Zhi Lu, Biqin Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing imaging noise is notoriously data-intensive and device-dependent, as modern sensors entangle physical signals with complex algorithmic artifacts. Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce "Noisomics", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy. By decoding noise as a multi-parametric footprint, our work redefines stochastic degradation as a vital information resource, empowering precise imaging diagnostics without prior device calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Jie Tan, Rupert Schreiner, Matthias Hausladen, Ali Asgharzade, Simon Edler, Julian Bartsch, Michael Bachmann, Andreas Schels, Ban-Hoe Kwan, Danny Wee-Kiat Ng, Yan-Chai Hum</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate characterization of silicon microstructures is essential for advancing microscale fabrication, quality control, and device performance. Traditional analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) often requires labor-intensive, manual evaluation of feature geometry, limiting throughput and reproducibility. In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Recognize the Unseen: Unusual Behavior Recognition from Pose Data Challenge, hosted at ISAS 2025. The challenge aims to address the critical need for automated recognition of unusual behaviors in facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities using non-invasive pose estimation data. Participating teams were tasked with distinguishing between normal and unusual activities based on skeleton keypoints extracted from video recordings of simulated scenarios. The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures. Submissions were assessed primarily using macro-averaged F1 scores to account for class imbalance. The results highlight the difficulty of modeling rare, abrupt actions in noisy, low-dimensional data, and emphasize the importance of capturing both temporal and contextual nuances in behavior modeling. Insights from this challenge may contribute to future developments in socially responsible AI applications for healthcare and behavior monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun An, Yiliang Song, Jiawei Shao, Zhe Sun, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse social interactions, such as bullying, harassment, and other illicit activities, pose significant threats to individual well-being and public safety, leaving profound impacts on physical and mental health. However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Que, Dieuwke van Dartel, Ilse Heeringa, Han Hegeman, Miriam Vollenbroek-Hutten, Ying Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical activity during hip fracture rehabilitation is essential for mitigating long-term functional decline in geriatric patients. However, it is rarely quantified in clinical practice. Existing continuous monitoring systems with commercially available wearable activity trackers are typically developed in middle-aged adults and therefore perform unreliably in older adults with slower and more variable gait patterns. This study aimed to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to improve continuous physical activity recognition in the context of hip fracture rehabilitation. 24 healthy older adults aged over 80 years were included to perform activities of daily living (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and postural transfers) under simulated free-living conditions for 75 minutes while wearing two accelerometers positioned on the lower back and anterior upper thigh. Model robustness was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The synthetic data demonstrated potential to improve generalization across participants. The resulting feature intervention model (FIM), aided by synthetic data guidance, achieved reliable activity recognition with mean F1-scores of 0.896 for walking, 0.927 for standing, 0.997 for sitting, 0.937 for lying down, and 0.816 for postural transfers. Compared with a control condition model without synthetic data, the FIM significantly improved the postural transfer detection, i.e., an activity class of high clinical relevance that is often overlooked in existing HAR literature. In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of robust activity recognition in older adults. Further validation in hip fracture patient populations is required to assess the clinical utility of the proposed monitoring system.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17056">Ego4OOD: Rethinking Egocentric Video Domain Generalization via Covariate Shift Scoring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Vaseqi, James Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric video action recognition under domain shifts remains challenging due to large intra-class spatio-temporal variability, long-tailed feature distributions, and strong correlations between actions and environments. Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between measured covariate shift and recognition performance, highlighting the importance of controlled benchmarks and quantitative domain characterization for studying out-of-distribution generalization in egocentric video.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert M. Belcher, Brendan C. Degryse, Leonard R. Kosta, Christopher J. Lowrance</p>
<p>Abstract: Adjusting rifle sights, a process commonly called "zeroing," requires shooters to identify and differentiate bullet holes from multiple firing iterations. Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration. While designed for rifle zeroing, this framework offers broader applicability in domains requiring the temporal differentiation of visually similar objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated emergent physical coherence, positioning them as potential world models. However, a gap remains between contemporary "stateless" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration. By addressing these challenges, the field can evolve from generating visually plausible videos to building robust, general-purpose world simulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisui Huang, Andreas Alpers, Ke Chen, Na Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an efficient method for image segmentation in the presence of strong inhomogeneities. The approach can be interpreted as a two-level clustering procedure: pixels are first grouped into superpixels via a linear least-squares assignment problem, which can be viewed as a special case of a discrete optimal transport (OT) problem, and these superpixels are subsequently greedily merged into object-level segments using the squared 2-Wasserstein distance between their empirical distributions. In contrast to conventional superpixel merging strategies based on mean-color distances, our framework employs a distributional OT distance, yielding a mathematically unified formulation across both clustering levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this perspective leads to improved segmentation accuracy on challenging images while retaining high computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual try-on systems allow users to interactively try different products within VR scenarios. However, most existing VTON methods operate only on predefined eyewear templates and lack support for fine-grained, user-driven customization. While GlassesGAN enables personalized 2D eyewear design, its capability remains limited to 2D image generation. Motivated by the success of 3D Gaussian Blendshapes in head reconstruction, we integrate these two techniques and propose GlassesGB, a framework that supports customizable eyewear generation for 3D head avatars. GlassesGB effectively bridges 2D generative customization with 3D head avatar rendering, addressing the challenge in achieving personalized eyewear design for VR applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qigan Sun, Chaoning Zhang, Jianwei Zhang, Xudong Wang, Jiehui Xie, Pengcheng Zheng, Haoyu Wang, Sungyoung Lee, Chi-lok Andy Tai, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in visual question answering tasks. However, directly applying existing fine-tuning methods to remote sensing (RS) images often leads to issues such as overfitting on background noise or neglecting target details. This is primarily due to the large-scale variations, sparse target distributions, and complex regional semantic features inherent in RS images. These challenges limit the effectiveness of MLLMs in RS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy called Guided Region-Aware Sparse Prompting (GRASP). GRASP introduces spatially structured soft prompts associated with spatial blocks extracted from a frozen visual token grid. Through a question-guided sparse fusion mechanism, GRASP dynamically aggregates task-specific context into a compact global prompt, enabling the model to focus on relevant regions while filtering out background noise. Extensive experiments on multiple RSVQA benchmarks show that GRASP achieves competitive performance compared to existing fine-tuning and prompt-based methods while maintaining high parameter efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusheng Du, Athiwat Kongkaeo, Ye Zhang, Haoran Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: For architectural design, representation across multiple Levels of Details (LoD) is essential for achieving a smooth transition from conceptual massing to detailed modeling. However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Performance uncertainty quantification is essential for reliable validation and eventual clinical translation of medical imaging artificial intelligence (AI). Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case. These results form key components for the development of future guidelines on reporting performance uncertainty in medical imaging AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Annotating medical data for training AI models is often costly and limited due to the shortage of specialists with relevant clinical expertise. This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Lin, Zongjian Li, Yuwei Niu, Kaixiong Gong, Yunyang Ge, Yunlong Lin, Mingzhe Zheng, JianWei Zhang, Miles Yang, Zhao Zhong, Liefeng Bo, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of image generation is currently bifurcated into autoregressive (AR) models operating on discrete tokens and diffusion models utilizing continuous latents. This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA. Codes is available at https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/iFSQ</p>

<p>Abstract: Frontier models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning with natural-language text, but they still exhibit major competency gaps in multimodal understanding and reasoning especially in high-value verticals such as biomedicine. Medical imaging report generation is a prominent example. Supervised fine-tuning can substantially improve performance, but they are prone to overfitting to superficial boilerplate patterns. In this paper, we introduce Universal Report Generation (UniRG) as a general framework for medical imaging report generation. By leveraging reinforcement learning as a unifying mechanism to directly optimize for evaluation metrics designed for end applications, UniRG can significantly improve upon supervised fine-tuning and attain durable generalization across diverse institutions and clinical practices. We trained UniRG-CXR on publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) data and conducted a thorough evaluation in CXR report generation with rigorous evaluation scenarios. On the authoritative ReXrank benchmark, UniRG-CXR sets new overall SOTA, outperforming prior state of the art by a wide margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheyu Lin, Katherine A. Flanigan, Sirajum Munir</p>
<p>Abstract: Social infrastructure and other built environments are increasingly expected to support well-being and community resilience by enabling social interaction. Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize "interaction" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination). DUET captures 12 dyadic interactions spanning all five kinesic functions-emblems, illustrators, affect displays, adaptors, and regulators-across four sensing modalities and three built-environment contexts, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of communicative intent through movement. Benchmarking six open-source, state-of-the-art human activity recognition models quantifies the difficulty of communicative-function recognition on DUET and highlights the limitations of ubiquitous monadic, action-level recognition when extended to dyadic, socially grounded interaction measurement. Building on DUET, our recognition framework infers communicative function directly from privacy-preserving skeletal motion without handcrafted action-to-function dictionaries; using a transfer-learning architecture, it reveals structured clustering of kinesic functions and a strong association between representation quality and classification performance while generalizing across subjects and contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anzhe Cheng, Italo Ivo Lima Dias Pinto, Paul Bogdan</p>
<p>Abstract: We adapt structural complexity analysis to three-dimensional signals, with an emphasis on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This framework captures the multiscale organization of volumetric data by coarse-graining the signal at progressively larger spatial scales and quantifying the information lost between successive resolutions. While the traditional block-based approach can become unstable at coarse resolutions due to limited sampling, we introduce a sliding-window coarse-graining scheme that provides smoother estimates and improved robustness at large scales. Using this refined method, we analyze large structural MRI datasets spanning mid- to late adulthood and find that structural complexity decreases systematically with age, with the strongest effects emerging at coarser scales. These findings highlight structural complexity as a reliable signal processing tool for multiscale analysis of 3D imaging data, while also demonstrating its utility in predicting biological age from brain MRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Aisha Syed, Matthew Andrews, Sean Kennedy</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengyue Zhang, Ruiwen Ding, Luoting Zhuang, Yuxiao Wu, Erika F. Rodriguez, William Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in computational pathology often fail to generalize across cohorts and institutions due to domain shift. Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Japan, civil infrastructure condition monitoring is mandated through visual inspection every five years. Field-captured damage images frequently contain concrete cracks and rebar exposure, often accompanied by construction signs revealing regional information. To enable safe infrastructure use without causing public anxiety, it is essential to protect regional information while accurately extracting damage features and visualizing key indicators for repair decision-making. This paper presents an open-source bridge damage detection system with regional privacy protection capabilities. We employ Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3 for rebar corrosion detection and utilize DBSCAN for automatic completion of missed regions. Construction sign regions are detected and protected through Gaussian blur. Four preprocessing methods improve OCR accuracy, and GPU optimization enables 1.7-second processing per image. The technology stack includes SAM3, PyTorch, OpenCV, pytesseract, and scikit-learn, achieving efficient bridge inspection with regional information protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Pereira, Vasco Lopes, Jo\~ao Neves, David Semedo</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is a novel task focused on describing unusual occurrences in videos. Despite growing interest, the evaluation of VAU remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on n-gram-based metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE-L) or LLM-based evaluation. The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where). Our benchmark introduces a) FVScore, a novel, human-aligned evaluation metric that assesses the presence of critical visual elements in LVLM answers, providing interpretable, fine-grained feedback; and b) FineW3, a novel, comprehensive dataset curated through a structured and fully automatic procedure that augments existing human annotations with high quality, fine-grained visual information. Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches. Detailed experiments on FineVAU unveil critical limitations in LVLM's ability to perceive anomalous events that require spatial and fine-grained temporal understanding, despite strong performance on coarse grain, static information, and events with strong visual cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angad Singh Ahuja, Aarush Ram Anandh</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise color control remains a persistent failure mode in text-to-image diffusion systems, particularly in design-oriented workflows where outputs must satisfy explicit, user-specified color targets. We present an inference-time, region-constrained color preservation method that steers a pretrained diffusion model without any additional training. Our approach combines (i) ROI-based inpainting for spatial selectivity, (ii) background-latent re-imposition to prevent color drift outside the ROI, and (iii) latent nudging via gradient guidance using a composite loss defined in CIE Lab and linear RGB. The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps. We show that mean-only baselines can satisfy average color constraints while producing perceptually salient local failures, motivating our distribution-aware objective. The resulting method provides a practical, training-free mechanism for targeted color adherence that can be integrated into standard Stable Diffusion inpainting pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Huang, Fang-Lue Zhang, Neil Dodgson</p>
<p>Abstract: 360{\deg} depth estimation is a challenging research problem due to the difficulty of finding a representation that both preserves global continuity and avoids distortion in spherical images. Existing methods attempt to leverage complementary information from multiple projections, but struggle with balancing global and local consistency. Their local patch features have limited global perception, and the combined global representation does not address discrepancies in feature extraction at the boundaries between patches. To address these issues, we propose Cross360, a novel cross-attention-based architecture integrating local and global information using less-distorted tangent patches along with equirectangular features. Our Cross Projection Feature Alignment module employs cross-attention to align local tangent projection features with the equirectangular projection's 360{\deg} field of view, ensuring each tangent projection patch is aware of the global context. Additionally, our Progressive Feature Aggregation with Attention module refines multi-scaled features progressively, enhancing depth estimation accuracy. Cross360 significantly outperforms existing methods across most benchmark datasets, especially those in which the entire 360{\deg} image is available, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurate and globally consistent depth estimation. The code and model are available at https://github.com/huangkun101230/Cross360.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Bai, Huiyao Zhang, Qi Wen, Shengyang Li, Xiaolin Tian, Atta ur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: The precise segmentation of geological linear features, spanning from planetary lineaments to terrestrial fractures, demands capturing long-range dependencies across complex anisotropic topologies. Although State Space Models (SSMs) offer near-linear computational complexity, their dependence on rigid, axis-aligned scanning trajectories induces a fundamental topological mismatch with curvilinear targets, resulting in fragmented context and feature erosion. To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework. Central to our design is the Structural Flux Block (SFB), which orchestrates an anisotropic information flux by integrating an Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG) with a Prior-Modulated Flow (PMF). This mechanism decouples feature orientation from spatial location, dynamically gating context aggregation along the target's intrinsic geometry rather than rigid paths. Furthermore, to mitigate serialization-induced noise in low-contrast environments, we incorporate a Hierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR) for multi-scale semantic alignment and a High-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU) to explicitly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of faint features. Extensive experiments on diverse geological benchmarks (LROC-Lineament, LineaMapper, and GeoCrack) demonstrate that Fluxamba establishes a new state-of-the-art. Notably, on the challenging LROC-Lineament dataset, it achieves an F1-score of 89.22% and mIoU of 89.87%. Achieving a real-time inference speed of over 24 FPS with only 3.4M parameters and 6.3G FLOPs, Fluxamba reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to heavy-weight baselines, thereby establishing a new Pareto frontier between segmentation fidelity and onboard deployment feasibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weloday Fikadu Moges, Jianmei Su, Amin Waqas</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep learning models for plant disease detection on edge devices such as IoT sensors, smartphones, and embedded systems is severely constrained by limited computational resources and energy budgets. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Dynamic Meta-Ensemble Framework (DMEF) for high-accuracy plant disease diagnosis under resource constraints. DMEF employs an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically combines the predictions of three lightweight convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3) by optimizing a trade-off between accuracy improvements (DeltaAcc) and computational efficiency (model size). During training, the ensemble weights are updated iteratively, favoring models exhibiting high performance and low complexity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for potato and maize diseases demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 99.53% and 96.61%, respectively, surpassing standalone models and static ensembles by 2.1% and 6.3%. With computationally efficient inference latency (<75ms) and a compact footprint (<1 million parameters), DMEF shows strong potential for edge-based agricultural monitoring, suggesting viability for scalable crop disease management. This bridges the gap between high-accuracy AI and practical field applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Li, Runni Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) grading based on radiographic images is a critical yet challenging task due to subtle inter-grade differences, annotation uncertainty, and the inherently ordinal nature of disease progression. Conventional deep learning approaches typically formulate this problem as deterministic multi-class classification, ignoring both the continuous progression of degeneration and the uncertainty in expert annotations. In this work, we propose ClinNet, a novel trustworthy framework that addresses KOA grading as an evidential ordinal regression problem. The proposed method integrates three key components: (1) a Bilateral Asymmetry Encoder (BAE) that explicitly models medial-lateral structural discrepancies; (2) a Diagnostic Memory Bank that maintains class-wise prototypes to stabilize feature representations; and (3) an Evidential Ordinal Head based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution to jointly estimate continuous KL grades and epistemic uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClinNet achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.892 and Accuracy of 0.768, statistically outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.001). Crucially, we demonstrate that the model's uncertainty estimates successfully flag out-of-distribution samples and potential misdiagnoses, paving the way for safe clinical deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation serves as a cornerstone for building world models, where multimodal contextual inference stands as the defining test of capability. In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasmine Lesner, Michael Beyeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal prostheses restore limited visual perception, but low spatial resolution and temporal persistence make reading difficult. In sequential letter presentation, the afterimage of one symbol can interfere with perception of the next, leading to systematic recognition errors. Rather than relying on future hardware improvements, we investigate whether optimizing the visual symbols themselves can mitigate this temporal interference. We present SymbolSight, a computational framework that selects symbol-to-letter mappings to minimize confusion among frequently adjacent letters. Using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) and a neural proxy observer, we estimate pairwise symbol confusability and optimize assignments using language-specific bigram statistics. Across simulations in Arabic, Bulgarian, and English, the resulting heterogeneous symbol sets reduced predicted confusion by a median factor of 22 relative to native alphabets. These results suggest that standard typography is poorly matched to serial, low-bandwidth prosthetic vision and demonstrate how computational modeling can efficiently narrow the design space of visual encodings to generate high-potential candidates for future psychophysical and clinical evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Vazquez, Jose A. Nu\~nez, Diego Adame, Alissen Moreno, Augustin Zhan, Huimin Li, Jinghao Yang, Haoteng Tang, Bin Fu, Pengfei Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and robust polyp segmentation is essential for early colorectal cancer detection and for computer-aided diagnosis. While convolutional neural network-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based U-Net variants have achieved strong performance, they still struggle to capture geometric and structural cues, especially in low-contrast or cluttered colonoscopy scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometric Prior-guided Module (GPM) that injects explicit geometric priors into U-Net-based architectures for polyp segmentation. Specifically, we fine-tune the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) on a simulated ColonDepth dataset to estimate depth maps of polyp images tailored to the endoscopic domain. These depth maps are then processed by GPM to encode geometric priors into the encoder's feature maps, where they are further refined using spatial and channel attention mechanisms that emphasize both local spatial and global channel information. GPM is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into diverse U-Net variants. Extensive experiments on five public polyp segmentation datasets demonstrate consistent gains over three strong baselines.

<p>Abstract: Automated Kellgren--Lawrence (KL) grading from knee radiographs is challenging due to subtle structural changes, long-range anatomical dependencies, and ambiguity near grade boundaries. We propose AGE-Net, a ConvNeXt-based framework that integrates Spectral--Spatial Fusion (SSF), Anatomical Graph Reasoning (AGR), and Differential Refinement (DFR). To capture predictive uncertainty and preserve label ordinality, AGE-Net employs a Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) evidential regression head and a pairwise ordinal ranking constraint. On a knee KL dataset, AGE-Net achieves a quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9017 +/- 0.0045 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.2349 +/- 0.0028 over three random seeds, outperforming strong CNN baselines and showing consistent gains in ablation studies. We further outline evaluations of uncertainty quality, robustness, and explainability, with additional experimental figures to be included in the full manuscript.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong He, Xin Zhan, Yancheng Bai, Rui Lan, Lei Sun, Xiangxiang Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world text image super-resolution aims to restore overall visual quality and text legibility in images suffering from diverse degradations and text distortions. However, the scarcity of text image data in existing datasets results in poor performance on text regions. In addition, datasets consisting of isolated text samples limit the quality of background reconstruction. To address these limitations, we construct Real-Texts, a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected from real-world images, which covers diverse scenarios and contains natural text instances in both Chinese and English. Additionally, we propose the TEXTS-Aware Diffusion Model (TEXTS-Diff) to achieve high-quality generation in both background and textual regions. This approach leverages abstract concepts to improve the understanding of textual elements within visual scenes and concrete text regions to enhance textual details. It mitigates distortions and hallucination artifacts commonly observed in text regions, while preserving high-quality visual scene fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, exhibiting superior generalization ability and text restoration accuracy in complex scenarios. All the code, model, and dataset will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wang, Xiaodong Zhang, Guanzhou Chen, Jiaqi Wang, Chenxi Liu, Xiaoliang Tan, Wenchao Guo, Xuyang Li, Xuanrui Wang, Zifan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing technology significantly enhances the understanding of surface semantics by integrating heterogeneous data such as optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Surface Models (DSM). However, in practical applications, the missing of modality data (e.g., optical or DSM) is a common and severe challenge, which leads to performance decline in traditional multimodal fusion models. Existing methods for addressing missing modalities still face limitations, including feature collapse and overly generalized recovered features. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{STARS} (\textbf{S}hared-specific \textbf{T}ranslation and \textbf{A}lignment for missing-modality \textbf{R}emote \textbf{S}ensing), a robust semantic segmentation framework for incomplete multimodal inputs. STARS is built on two key designs. First, we introduce an asymmetric alignment mechanism with bidirectional translation and stop-gradient, which effectively prevents feature collapse and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters. Second, we propose a Pixel-level Semantic sampling Alignment (PSA) strategy that combines class-balanced pixel sampling with cross-modality semantic alignment loss, to mitigate alignment failures caused by severe class imbalance and improve minority-class recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailong Yan, Shice Liu, Xiangtao Zhang, Lujian Yao, Fengxiang Yang, Jinwei Chen, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the current era of mobile internet, Lightweight Low-Light Image Enhancement (L3IE) is critical for mobile devices, which faces a persistent trade-off between visual quality and model compactness. While recent methods employ disentangling strategies to simplify lightweight architectural design, such as Retinex theory and YUV color space transformations, their performance is fundamentally limited by overlooking channel-specific degradation patterns and cross-channel interactions. To address this gap, we perform a frequency-domain analysis that confirms the superiority of the YUV color space for L3IE. We identify a key insight: the Y channel primarily loses low-frequency content, while the UV channels are corrupted by high-frequency noise. Leveraging this finding, we propose a novel YUV-based paradigm that strategically restores channels using a Dual-Stream Global-Local Attention module for the Y channel, a Y-guided Local-Aware Frequency Attention module for the UV channels, and a Guided Interaction module for final feature fusion. Extensive experiments validate that our model establishes a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, delivering superior visual quality with a significantly lower parameter count.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianliang Huang, Zhizhou Zhong, Shuhang Chen, Yi Xu, Juhong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis. However, there is much improvement room on restoring 3D scenes based on NeRF from corrupted images, which are common in natural scene captures and can significantly impact the effectiveness of NeRF. This paper introduces NeRF-MIR, a novel neural rendering approach specifically proposed for the restoration of masked images, demonstrating the potential of NeRF in this domain. Recognizing that randomly emitting rays to pixels in NeRF may not effectively learn intricate image textures, we propose a \textbf{P}atch-based \textbf{E}ntropy for \textbf{R}ay \textbf{E}mitting (\textbf{PERE}) strategy to distribute emitted rays properly. This enables NeRF-MIR to fuse comprehensive information from images of different views. Additionally, we introduce a \textbf{P}rogressively \textbf{I}terative \textbf{RE}storation (\textbf{PIRE}) mechanism to restore the masked regions in a self-training process. Furthermore, we design a dynamically-weighted loss function that automatically recalibrates the loss weights for masked regions. As existing datasets do not support NeRF-based masked image restoration, we construct three masked datasets to simulate corrupted scenarios. Extensive experiments on real data and constructed datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeRF-MIR over its counterparts in masked image restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. L. Mamud, Piyoosh Jaysaval, Frederick D Day-Lewis, M. K. Mudunuru</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a powerful remote sensing tool for mineral exploration, capitalizing on unique spectral signatures of minerals. However, traditional classification methods such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines often struggle with environmental noise in data, sensor limitations, and the computational complexity of analyzing high-dimensional HSI data. This study presents HyDeMiC (Hyperspectral Deep Learning-based Mineral Classifier), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for robust mineral classification under noisy data. To train HyDeMiC, laboratory-measured hyperspectral data for 115 minerals spanning various mineral groups were used from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) library. The training dataset was generated by convolving reference mineral spectra with an HSI sensor response function. These datasets contained three copper-bearing minerals, Cuprite, Malachite, and Chalcopyrite, used as case studies for performance demonstration. The trained CNN model was evaluated on several synthetic 2D hyperspectral datasets with noise levels of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. Our noisy data analysis aims to replicate realistic field conditions. The HyDeMiC's performance was assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), providing a comprehensive measure across different noise regimes. Results demonstrate that HyDeMiC achieved near-perfect classification accuracy (MCC = 1.00) on clean and low-noise datasets and maintained strong performance under moderate noise conditions. These findings emphasize HyDeMiC's robustness in the presence of moderate noise, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in hyperspectral imaging, where noise is often a significant challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhi Guo, Guangchi Fang, Shu Yang, Bing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing displacement strategies in semi-supervised segmentation only operate on rectangular regions, ignoring anatomical structures and resulting in boundary distortions and semantic inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose UCAD, an Uncertainty-Guided Contour-Aware Displacement framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation that preserves contour-aware semantics while enhancing consistency learning. Our UCAD leverages superpixels to generate anatomically coherent regions aligned with anatomy boundaries, and an uncertainty-guided selection mechanism to selectively displace challenging regions for better consistency learning. We further propose a dynamic uncertainty-weighted consistency loss, which adaptively stabilizes training and effectively regularizes the model on unlabeled regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy under limited annotation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Ling, Kai Hu, Hangcheng Liu, Xingshuo Han, Tianwei Zhang, Changhai Ou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world intelligent systems for perception and reasoning in open physical environments. While LVLMs are known to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, existing methods either require access to input channels or depend on knowledge of user queries, assumptions that rarely hold in practical deployments. We propose the first Physical Prompt Injection Attack (PPIA), a black-box, query-agnostic attack that embeds malicious typographic instructions into physical objects perceivable by the LVLM. PPIA requires no access to the model, its inputs, or internal pipeline, and operates solely through visual observation. It combines offline selection of highly recognizable and semantically effective visual prompts with strategic environment-aware placement guided by spatiotemporal attention, ensuring that the injected prompts are both perceivable and influential on model behavior. We evaluate PPIA across 10 state-of-the-art LVLMs in both simulated and real-world settings on tasks including visual question answering, planning, and navigation, PPIA achieves attack success rates up to 98%, with strong robustness under varying physical conditions such as distance, viewpoint, and illumination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ding, Xiu Yan, Chuanlong Xie, Yao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking methods have always been effective means of protecting intellectual property, yet they face significant challenges. Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Fan, Weidong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras action recognition (EAR) offers compelling privacy-protecting and efficiency advantages, where temporal motion dynamics is of great importance. Existing spatiotemporal multi-view representation learning (SMVRL) methods for event-based object recognition (EOR) offer promising solutions by projecting H-W-T events along spatial axis H and W, yet are limited by its translation-variant spatial binning representation and naive early concatenation fusion architecture. This paper reexamines the key SMVRL design stages for EAR and propose: (i) a principled spatiotemporal multi-view representation through translation-invariant dense conversion of sparse events, (ii) a dual-branch, dynamic fusion architecture that models sample-wise complementarity between motion features from different views, and (iii) a bio-inspired temporal warping augmentation that mimics speed variability of real-world human actions. On three challenging EAR datasets of HARDVS, DailyDVS-200 and THU-EACT-50-CHL, we show +7.0%, +10.7%, and +10.2% Top-1 accuracy gains over existing SMVRL EOR method with surprising 30.1% reduced parameters and 35.7% lower computations, establishing our framework as a novel and powerful EAR paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Fang, Jian Li, Wei Chen, Bin Hu, Ying-Cong Chen, Xin Tang, Liang Diao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved rapid progress in Chinese language understanding, yet accurately evaluating their capabilities remains challenged by benchmark saturation and prohibitive computational costs. While static leaderboards provide snapshot rankings, they often mask the structural trade-offs between capabilities. In this work, we present ReLE (Robust Efficient Live Evaluation), a scalable system designed to diagnose Capability Anisotropy, the non-uniformity of model performance across domains. Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples. We introduce two methodological contributions to address current evaluation pitfalls: (1) A Symbolic-Grounded Hybrid Scoring Mechanism that eliminates embedding-based false positives in reasoning tasks; (2) A Dynamic Variance-Aware Scheduler based on Neyman allocation with noise correction, which reduces compute costs by 70\% compared to full-pass evaluations while maintaining a ranking correlation of $\rho=0.96$. Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior. We position ReLE not as a replacement for comprehensive static benchmarks, but as a high-frequency diagnostic monitor for the evolving model landscape.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17405">HAAF: Hierarchical Adaptation and Alignment of Foundation Models for Few-Shot Pathology Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunze Yang, Wenjie Zhao, Yue Tang, Junbo Lu, Jiusong Ge, Qidong Liu, Zeyu Gao, Chen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision pathology relies on detecting fine-grained morphological abnormalities within specific Regions of Interest (ROIs), as these local, texture-rich cues - rather than global slide contexts - drive expert diagnostic reasoning. While Vision-Language (V-L) models promise data efficiency by leveraging semantic priors, adapting them faces a critical Granularity Mismatch, where generic representations fail to resolve such subtle defects. Current adaptation methods often treat modalities as independent streams, failing to ground semantic prompts in ROI-specific visual contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptation and Alignment Framework (HAAF). At its core is a novel Cross-Level Scaled Alignment (CLSA) mechanism that enforces a sequential calibration order: visual features first inject context into text prompts to generate content-adaptive descriptors, which then spatially guide the visual encoder to spotlight anomalies. Additionally, a dual-branch inference strategy integrates semantic scores with geometric prototypes to ensure stability in few-shot settings. Experiments on four benchmarks show HAAF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively scales with domain-specific backbones (e.g., CONCH) in low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsharaj Pathak, Vineeth N Balasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is an emerging area of research that aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. Most of the successful methods in this area rely on the concept of neighborhood consistency but are prone to errors due to misleading neighborhood information. In this paper, we explore this approach from the point of view of learning more informative clusters and mitigating the effect of noisy neighbors using a concept called neighborhood signature, and demonstrate that adaptation can be achieved using just a single loss term tailored to optimize the similarity and dissimilarity of predictions of samples in the target domain. In particular, our proposed method outperforms existing methods in the challenging VisDA dataset while also yielding competitive results on other benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Hasib, A. S. M. Ahsanul Sarkar Akib</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created unprecedented opportunities for remote monitoring and control applications across various domains. Traditional monitoring systems often suffer from limitations in real-time data accessibility, remote controllability, and cloud integration. This paper presents a cloud-enabled IoT system that leverages Google's Firebase Realtime Database for synchronized environmental monitoring and device control. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to interface with a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, while enabling remote control of two LED indicators through a cloud-based interface. Real-time sensor data is transmitted to Firebase, providing a synchronized platform accessible from multiple devices simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate reliable data transmission with 99.2\% success rate, real-time control latency under 1.5 seconds, and persistent data storage for historical analysis. The system architecture offers a scalable framework for various IoT applications, from smart home automation to industrial monitoring, with a total implementation cost of \$32.50. The integration of Firebase provides robust cloud capabilities without requiring complex server infrastructure, making advanced IoT applications accessible to developers and researchers with limited resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiu-hong Kao, Chak Ho Huang, Huaiqian Liu, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing works of reasoning segmentation often fall short in complex cases, particularly when addressing complicated queries and out-of-domain images. Inspired by the chain-of-thought reasoning, where harder problems require longer thinking steps/time, this paper aims to explore a system that can think step-by-step, look up information if needed, generate results, self-evaluate its own results, and refine the results, in the same way humans approach harder questions. We introduce CoT-Seg, a training-free framework that rethinks reasoning segmentation by combining chain-of-thought reasoning with self-correction. Instead of fine-tuning, CoT-Seg leverages the inherent reasoning ability of pre-trained MLLMs (GPT-4o) to decompose queries into meta-instructions, extract fine-grained semantics from images, and identify target objects even under implicit or complex prompts. Moreover, CoT-Seg incorporates a self-correction stage: the model evaluates its own segmentation against the original query and reasoning trace, identifies mismatches, and iteratively refines the mask. This tight integration of reasoning and correction significantly improves reliability and robustness, especially in ambiguous or error-prone cases. Furthermore, our CoT-Seg framework allows easy incorporation of retrieval-augmented reasoning, enabling the system to access external knowledge when the input lacks sufficient information. To showcase CoT-Seg's ability to handle very challenging cases ,we introduce a new dataset ReasonSeg-Hard. Our results highlight that combining chain-of-thought reasoning, self-correction, offers a powerful paradigm for vision-language integration driven segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) is the clinical reference standard for assessing coronary artery disease, yet quantitative analysis is limited by the difficulty of robust vessel segmentation in routine data. Low contrast, motion, foreshortening, overlap, and catheter confounding degrade segmentation and contribute to domain shift across centers. Reliable segmentation, together with vessel-type labeling, enables vessel-specific coronary analytics and downstream measurements that depend on anatomical localization. From 670 cine sequences (407 subjects), we select a best frame near peak opacification using a low-intensity histogram criterion and apply joint super-resolution and enhancement. We benchmark classical Meijering, Frangi, and Sato vesselness filters under per-image oracle tuning, a single global mean setting, and per-image parameter prediction via Support Vector Regression (SVR). Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006. On DCA1 as a strict external test, Dice drops to 0.798 (coronary-only) and 0.814 (merged), while light in-domain fine-tuning recovers to 0.881+/-0.014 and 0.882+/-0.015. Vessel-type labeling achieves 98.5% accuracy (Dice 0.844) for RCA, 95.4% (0.786) for LAD, and 96.2% (0.794) for LCX. Learned per-image tuning strengthens classical pipelines, while high-resolution FPN models and merged-label supervision improve stability and external transfer with modest adaptation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Single Image Reflection Separation (SIRS) disentangles mixed images into transmission and reflection layers. Existing methods suffer from transmission-reflection confusion under nonlinear mixing, particularly in deep decoder layers, due to implicit fusion mechanisms and inadequate multi-scale coordination. We propose ReflexSplit, a dual-stream framework with three key innovations. (1) Cross-scale Gated Fusion (CrGF) adaptively aggregates semantic priors, texture details, and decoder context across hierarchical depths, stabilizing gradient flow and maintaining feature consistency. (2) Layer Fusion-Separation Blocks (LFSB) alternate between fusion for shared structure extraction and differential separation for layer-specific disentanglement. Inspired by Differential Transformer, we extend attention cancellation to dual-stream separation via cross-stream subtraction. (3) Curriculum training progressively strengthens differential separation through depth-dependent initialization and epoch-wise warmup. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with superior perceptual quality and robust generalization.

<p>Abstract: Shadow removal under diverse lighting conditions requires disentangling illumination from intrinsic reflectance, a challenge compounded when physical priors are not properly aligned. We propose PhaSR (Physically Aligned Shadow Removal), addressing this through dual-level prior alignment to enable robust performance from single-light shadows to multi-source ambient lighting. First, Physically Aligned Normalization (PAN) performs closed-form illumination correction via Gray-world normalization, log-domain Retinex decomposition, and dynamic range recombination, suppressing chromatic bias. Second, Geometric-Semantic Rectification Attention (GSRA) extends differential attention to cross-modal alignment, harmonizing depth-derived geometry with DINO-v2 semantic embeddings to resolve modal conflicts under varying illumination. Experiments show competitive performance in shadow removal with lower complexity and generalization to ambient lighting where traditional methods fail under multi-source illumination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Zhou, Zhen Huang, Yingqiu Li, Yue Ouyang, Suncheng Xiang, Zehua Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prerequisite for precise radiotherapy planning and surgical navigation. While recent Transformer-based models such as Swin UNETR have achieved impressive benchmark performance, their clinical utility is often compromised by two critical issues: sensitivity to missing modalities (common in clinical practice) and a lack of confidence calibration. Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we construct a robust deterministic backbone by integrating a Zero-Init Multimodal Contextual Fusion (MMCF) module and a Residual-Gated Deep Decoder Supervision (DDS) mechanism, enabling stable feature learning and precise boundary delineation with significantly reduced Hausdorff Distance, even under modality corruption. Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Robbins, Xiaotong Liu, Yu Wu, Le Sun, Grady McPeak, Abby Stylianou, Robert Pless</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models like CLIP create aligned embedding spaces for text and images, making it possible for anyone to build a visual classifier by simply naming the classes they want to distinguish. However, a model that works well in one domain may fail in another, and non-expert users have no straightforward way to assess whether their chosen VLM will work on their problem. We build on prior work using text-only comparisons to evaluate how well a model works for a given natural language task, and explore approaches that also generate synthetic images relevant to that task to evaluate and refine the prediction of zero-shot accuracy. We show that generated imagery to the baseline text-only scores substantially improves the quality of these predictions. Additionally, it gives a user feedback on the kinds of images that were used to make the assessment. Experiments on standard CLIP benchmark datasets demonstrate that the image-based approach helps users predict, without any labeled examples, whether a VLM will be effective for their application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liang, Haowei Liu, Chi-Man Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the tremendous success of neural networks, benign images can be corrupted by adversarial perturbations to deceive these models. Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object. Theoretically, we describe the principles of OTI from the perspectives of decision boundaries as well as the mid- and high-frequency characteristics of adversarial perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OTI is effective and computationally efficient. In addition, our OTI provides the adversarial machine learning community with a visual understanding of attackability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Downes, Sam Saltwick, Anthony Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The compression of satellite imagery remains an important research area as hundreds of terabytes of images are collected every day, which drives up storage and bandwidth costs. Although progress has been made in increasing the resolution of these satellite images, many downstream tasks are only interested in small regions of any given image. These areas of interest vary by task but, once known, can be used to optimize how information within the image is encoded. Whereas standard image encoding methods, even those optimized for remote sensing, work on the whole image equally, there are emerging methods that can be guided by saliency maps to focus on important areas. In this work we show how imagery preprocessing techniques driven by saliency maps can be used with traditional lossy compression coding standards to create variable rate image compression within a single large satellite image. Specifically, we use variable sized smoothing kernels that map to different quantized saliency levels to process imagery pixels in order to optimize downstream compression and encoding schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. Recent work augments LLMs with external tools to enable agentic reasoning, achieving high utility and efficiency in a plug-and-play manner. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of such methods to malicious manipulation of the tool-calling process remain largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a tool-specific attack surface and propose Sponge Tool Attack (STA), which disrupts agentic reasoning solely by rewriting the input prompt under a strict query-only access assumption. Without any modification on the underlying model or the external tools, STA converts originally concise and efficient reasoning trajectories into unnecessarily verbose and convoluted ones before arriving at the final answer. This results in substantial computational overhead while remaining stealthy by preserving the original task semantics and user intent. To achieve this, we design STA as an iterative, multi-agent collaborative framework with explicit rewritten policy control, and generates benign-looking prompt rewrites from the original one with high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across 6 models (including both open-source models and closed-source APIs), 12 tools, 4 agentic frameworks, and 13 datasets spanning 5 domains validate the effectiveness of STA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Doerrich, Francesco Di Salvo, Jonas Alle, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in medical image analysis often struggle with generalizability across domains and demographic groups due to data heterogeneity and scarcity. Traditional augmentation improves robustness, but fails under substantial domain shifts. Recent advances in stylistic augmentation enhance domain generalization by varying image styles but fall short in terms of style diversity or by introducing artifacts into the generated images. To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts. Additionally, we show that Stylizing ViT is effective beyond training, achieving a 17% performance improvement during inference when used for test-time augmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewan Cho, Taeryang Kim, Andrew Jaeyong Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for semantic understanding but inherently struggles to perceive geometric structure. Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Pan, Yuhao Chen, Fengqing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world meal images often contain multiple food items, making reliable compositional food image generation important for applications such as image-based dietary assessment, where multi-food data augmentation is needed, and recipe visualization. However, modern text-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate accurate multi-food images due to object entanglement, where adjacent foods (e.g., rice and soup) fuse together because many foods do not have clear boundaries. To address this challenge, we introduce Prompt Grafting (PG), a training-free framework that combines explicit spatial cues in text with implicit layout guidance during sampling. PG runs a two-stage process where a layout prompt first establishes distinct regions and the target prompt is grafted once layout formation stabilizes. The framework enables food entanglement control: users can specify which food items should remain separated or be intentionally mixed by editing the arrangement of layouts. Across two food datasets, our method significantly improves the presence of target objects and provides qualitative evidence of controllable separation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyu Zhang, Yuan Hu, Yong Li, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified remote sensing multimodal models exhibit a pronounced spatial reversal curse: Although they can accurately recognize and describe object locations in images, they often fail to faithfully execute the same spatial relations during text-to-image generation, where such relations constitute core semantic information in remote sensing. Motivated by this observation, we propose Uni-RS, the first unified multimodal model tailored for remote sensing, to explicitly address the spatial asymmetry between understanding and generation. Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis. We then impose Spatial-Aware Query Supervision to bias learnable queries toward spatial relations explicitly specified in the instruction. Finally, we develop Image-Caption Spatial Layout Variation to expose the model to systematic geometry-consistent spatial transformations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach substantially improves spatial faithfulness in text-to-image generation, while maintaining strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks like image captioning, visual grounding, and VQA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexi Jia, Jinchao Zhang, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Representing artistic style is challenging due to its deep entanglement with semantic content. We propose StyleDecoupler, an information-theoretic framework that leverages a key insight: multi-modal vision models encode both style and content, while uni-modal models suppress style to focus on content-invariant features. By using uni-modal representations as content-only references, we isolate pure style features from multi-modal embeddings through mutual information minimization. StyleDecoupler operates as a plug-and-play module on frozen Vision-Language Models without fine-tuning. We also introduce WeART, a large-scale benchmark of 280K artworks across 152 styles and 1,556 artists. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on style retrieval across WeART and WikiART, while enabling applications like style relationship mapping and generative model evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Kadivar, Guansheng Li, Jianlu Zheng, John M. Higgins, Ming Dao, George Em Karniadakis, Mengjia Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding sickle cell dynamics requires accurate identification of morphological transitions under diverse biophysical conditions, particularly in densely packed and overlapping cell populations. Here, we present an automated deep learning framework that integrates AI-assisted annotation, segmentation, classification, and instance counting to quantify red blood cell (RBC) populations across varying density regimes in time-lapse microscopy data. Experimental images were annotated using the Roboflow platform to generate labeled dataset for training an nnU-Net segmentation model. The trained network enables prediction of the temporal evolution of the sickle cell fraction, while a watershed algorithm resolves overlapping cells to enhance quantification accuracy. Despite requiring only a limited amount of labeled data for training, the framework achieves high segmentation performance, effectively addressing challenges associated with scarce manual annotations and cell overlap. By quantitatively tracking dynamic changes in RBC morphology, this approach can more than double the experimental throughput via densely packed cell suspensions, capture drug-dependent sickling behavior, and reveal distinct mechanobiological signatures of cellular morphological evolution. Overall, this AI-driven framework establishes a scalable and reproducible computational platform for investigating cellular biomechanics and assessing therapeutic efficacy in microphysiological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting-Hsun Chi, Chu-Rong Chen, Chi-Tun Hsu, Hsuan-Ting Lin, Sheng-Yu Huang, Cheng Sun, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing accurate surfaces with radiance fields has progressed rapidly, yet two promising explicit representations, 3D Gaussian Splatting and sparse-voxel rasterization, exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. 3D Gaussian Splatting converges quickly and carries useful geometric priors, but surface fidelity is limited by its point-like parameterization. Sparse-voxel rasterization provides continuous opacity fields and crisp geometry, but its typical uniform dense-grid initialization slows convergence and underutilizes scene structure. We combine the advantages of both by introducing a voxel initialization method that places voxels at plausible locations and with appropriate levels of detail, yielding a strong starting point for per-scene optimization. To further enhance depth consistency without blurring edges, we propose refined depth geometry supervision that converts multi-view cues into direct per-ray depth regularization. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate improvements over prior methods in geometric accuracy, better fine-structure recovery, and more complete surfaces, while maintaining fast convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tayyab Nasir, Daochang Liu, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) has become the standard approach for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASSR). To date, no empirical study has systematically examined the effectiveness of existing methods, nor investigated the effects of different training recipes, such as scaling laws, objective design, and optimization strategies. A rigorous empirical analysis is essential not only for benchmarking performance and revealing true gains but also for establishing the current state of ASSR, identifying saturation limits, and highlighting promising directions. We fill this gap by comparing existing techniques across diverse settings and presenting aggregated performance results on multiple image quality metrics. We contribute a unified framework and code repository to facilitate reproducible comparisons. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of carefully controlled training configurations on perceptual image quality and examine a new loss function that penalizes intensity variations while preserving edges, textures, and finer details during training. We conclude the following key insights that have been previously overlooked: (1) Recent, more complex INR methods provide only marginal improvements over earlier methods. (2) Model performance is strongly correlated to training configurations, a factor overlooked in prior works. (3) The proposed loss enhances texture fidelity across architectures, emphasizing the role of objective design for targeted perceptual gains. (4) Scaling laws apply to INR-based ASSR, confirming predictable gains with increased model complexity and data diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junran Lu, Yuanqi Li, Hengji Li, Jie Guo, Yanwen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Boundary Representation (B-Rep) is the widely adopted standard
  in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and manufacturing. However, generative modeling of B-Reps remains a formidable challenge due to their inherent heterogeneity as geometric cell complexes, which entangles topology with geometry across cells of varying orders (i.e., $k$-cells such as vertices, edges, faces). Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries. By decoupling the rigid hierarchy, our representation unifies vertices, edges, and faces, enabling the joint generation of topology and geometry with global context awareness.
  We synthesize these particle sets using a multi-modal flow matching framework to handle unconditional generation as well as precise conditional tasks, such as 3D reconstruction from single-view or point cloud. Furthermore, the explicit and localized nature of our representation naturally extends to downstream tasks like local in-painting and enables the direct synthesis of non-manifold structures (e.g., wireframes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-fidelity CAD models with superior validity and editability compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced models capable of synthesizing stunning visual content from simple text prompts. However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a crucial trade-off in current SOTA models between visual spectacle and strict script adherence, providing valuable insights for the future of automated filmmaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Cao, Ren Li, Corentin Dumery, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Sewing patterns define the structural foundation of garments and are essential for applications such as fashion design, fabrication, and physical simulation. Despite progress in automated pattern generation, accurately modeling sewing patterns remains difficult due to the broad variability in panel geometry and seam arrangements. In this work, we introduce a sewing pattern modeling method based on an implicit representation. We represent each panel using a signed distance field that defines its boundary and an unsigned distance field that identifies seam endpoints, and encode these fields into a continuous latent space that enables differentiable meshing. A latent flow matching model learns distributions over panel combinations in this representation, and a stitching prediction module recovers seam relations from extracted edge segments. This formulation allows accurate modeling and generation of sewing patterns with complex structures. We further show that it can be used to estimate sewing patterns from images with improved accuracy relative to existing approaches, and supports applications such as pattern completion and refitting, providing a practical tool for digital fashion design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for video compression. However, existing INR-based frameworks typically suffer from inherent spectral bias, which favors low-frequency components and leads to over-smoothed reconstructions and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose FaNeRV, a Frequency-aware Neural Representation for videos, which explicitly decouples low- and high-frequency components to enable efficient and faithful video reconstruction. FaNeRV introduces a multi-resolution supervision strategy that guides the network to progressively capture global structures and fine-grained textures through staged supervision . To further enhance high-frequency reconstruction, we propose a dynamic high-frequency injection mechanism that adaptively emphasizes challenging regions. In addition, we design a frequency-decomposed network module to improve feature modeling across different spectral bands. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FaNeRV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art INR methods and achieves competitive rate-distortion performance against traditional codecs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Zhu, Xinfeng Zhang, Lv Tang, Junhao Jiang, Gai Zhang, Jia Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video compression has recently benefited from implicit neural representations (INRs), which model videos as continuous functions. INRs offer compact storage and flexible reconstruction, providing a promising alternative to traditional codecs. However, most existing INR-based methods treat the temporal dimension as an independent input, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Temporal Neural Representation for Videos, TeNeRV. TeNeRV integrates short- and long-term dependencies through two key components. First, an Inter-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module aggregates features from adjacent frames, enforcing local temporal coherence and capturing fine-grained motion. Second, a GoP-Adaptive Modulation (GAM) mechanism partitions videos into Groups-of-Pictures and learns group-specific priors. The mechanism modulates network parameters, enabling adaptive representations across different GoPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeNeRV consistently outperforms existing INR-based methods in rate-distortion performance, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Jiang, Chen Wu, Zhenghui Zhao, Chengxi Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Change detection (CD) aims to identify surface changes from multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. In real-world scenarios, Pixel-level change labels are expensive to acquire, and existing models struggle to adapt to scenarios with diverse annotation availability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified change detection framework (UniCD), which collaboratively handles supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised tasks through a coupled architecture. UniCD eliminates architectural barriers through a shared encoder and multi-branch collaborative learning mechanism, achieving deep coupling of heterogeneous supervision signals. Specifically, UniCD consists of three supervision-specific branches. In the supervision branch, UniCD introduces the spatial-temporal awareness module (STAM), achieving efficient synergistic fusion of bi-temporal features. In the weakly-supervised branch, we construct change representation regularization (CRR), which steers model convergence from coarse-grained activations toward coherent and separable change modeling. In the unsupervised branch, we propose semantic prior-driven change inference (SPCI), which transforms unsupervised tasks into controlled weakly-supervised path optimization. Experiments on mainstream datasets demonstrate that UniCD achieves optimal performance across three tasks. It exhibits significant accuracy improvements in weakly and unsupervised scenarios, surpassing current state-of-the-art by 12.72% and 12.37% on LEVIR-CD, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Song, Xinyu Gong, Bangya Liu, Zelin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Subject-to-Video Generation (S2V) methods have achieved high-fidelity and subject-consistent video generation, yet remain constrained to single-view subject references. This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabin Dulal, Wenfeng Jia, Lihong Zheng, Jane Quinn</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate cattle live weight estimation is vital for livestock management, welfare, and productivity. Traditional methods, such as manual weighing using a walk-over weighing system or proximate measurements using body condition scoring, involve manual handling of stock and can impact productivity from both a stock and economic perspective. To address these issues, this study investigated a cost-effective, non-contact method for live weight calculation in cattle using 3D reconstruction. The proposed pipeline utilized multi-view RGB images with SAM 3D-based agreement-guided fusion, followed by ensemble regression. Our approach generates a single 3D point cloud per animal and compares classical ensemble models with deep learning models under low-data conditions. Results show that SAM 3D with multi-view agreement fusion outperforms other 3D generation methods, while classical ensemble models provide the most consistent performance for practical farm scenarios (R$^2$ = 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, MAPE = 2.22 $\pm$ 0.56 \%), making this practical for on-farm implementation. These findings demonstrate that improving reconstruction quality is more critical than increasing model complexity for scalable deployment on farms where producing a large volume of 3D data is challenging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Luo, Peng Chen, Xiaotao Huang, LiQun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur high computational costs due to significant redundancy in their visual tokens. To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption. Notably, its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Denoising-based diffusion transformers, despite their strong generation performance, suffer from inefficient training convergence. Existing methods addressing this issue, such as REPA (relying on external representation encoders) or SRA (requiring dual-model setups), inevitably incur heavy computational overhead during training due to external dependencies. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes \textbf{\namex}, a lightweight intrinsic guidance framework for efficient diffusion training. \name leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) features: their reconstruction property ensures inherent encoding of visual priors like rich texture details, structural patterns, and basic semantic information. Specifically, \name aligns the intermediate latent features of diffusion transformers with VAE features via a lightweight projection layer, supervised by a feature alignment loss. This design accelerates training without extra representation encoders or dual-model maintenance, resulting in a simple yet effective pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \name improves both generation quality and training convergence speed compared to vanilla diffusion transformers, matches or outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, and incurs merely 4\% extra GFLOPs with zero additional cost for external guidance models.</p>

Due to inadequate geometry parameterization and approximation, existing shape reconstruction methods suffer from poor multi-view consistency and are sensitive to floaters. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical derivation that establishes Gaussian primitives as a specific type of stochastic solids. This theoretical framework provides a principled foundation for Geometry-Grounded Gaussian Splatting by enabling the direct treatment of Gaussian primitives as explicit geometric representations. Using the volumetric nature of stochastic solids, our method efficiently renders high-quality depth maps for fine-grained geometry extraction. Experiments show that our method achieves the best shape reconstruction results among all Gaussian Splatting-based methods on public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lan Yang, Minghan Yang, Ke Li, Honggang Zhang, Kaiyue Pang, Yi-Zhe Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based image reconstruction have achieved remarkable photo-realistic fidelity. Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingsong Xia, Siqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image artificial intelligence models often achieve strong performance in single-center or single-device settings, yet their effectiveness frequently deteriorates in real-world cross-center deployment due to domain shift, limiting clinical generalizability. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight domain generalization framework with quantum-enhanced collaborative learning, enabling robust generalization to unseen target domains without relying on real multi-center labeled data. Specifically, a MobileNetV2-based domain-invariant encoder is constructed and optimized through three key components: (1) multi-domain imaging shift simulation using brightness, contrast, sharpening, and noise perturbations to emulate heterogeneous acquisition conditions; (2) domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal to suppress domain-discriminative features; and (3) a lightweight quantum feature enhancement layer that applies parameterized quantum circuits for nonlinear feature mapping and entanglement modeling. In addition, a test-time adaptation strategy is employed during inference to further alleviate distribution shifts. Experiments on simulated multi-center medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models without domain generalization or quantum enhancement on unseen domains, achieving reduced domain-specific performance variance and improved AUC and sensitivity. These results highlight the clinical potential of quantum-enhanced domain generalization under constrained computational resources and provide a feasible paradigm for hybrid quantum--classical medical imaging systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonwoo Jeong, Cheng Sun, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Minsu Cho, Jaesung Choe</p>
<p>Abstract: Promptable segmentation has emerged as a powerful paradigm in computer vision, enabling users to guide models in parsing complex scenes with prompts such as clicks, boxes, or textual cues. Recent advances, exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have extended this paradigm to videos and multi-view images. However, the lack of 3D awareness often leads to inconsistent results, necessitating costly per-scene optimization to enforce 3D consistency. In this work, we introduce MV-SAM, a framework for multi-view segmentation that achieves 3D consistency using pointmaps -- 3D points reconstructed from unposed images by recent visual geometry models. Leveraging the pixel-point one-to-one correspondence of pointmaps, MV-SAM lifts images and prompts into 3D space, eliminating the need for explicit 3D networks or annotated 3D data. Specifically, MV-SAM extends SAM by lifting image embeddings from its pretrained encoder into 3D point embeddings, which are decoded by a transformer using cross-attention with 3D prompt embeddings. This design aligns 2D interactions with 3D geometry, enabling the model to implicitly learn consistent masks across views through 3D positional embeddings. Trained on the SA-1B dataset, our method generalizes well across domains, outperforming SAM2-Video and achieving comparable performance with per-scene optimization baselines on NVOS, SPIn-NeRF, ScanNet++, uCo3D, and DL3DV benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao He, Tieyuan Chen, Kangyu Wang, Ziran Qin, Yang Shao, Chaofan Gan, Shijie Li, Zuxuan Wu, Weiyao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard Autoregressive Video LLMs inevitably suffer from causal masking biases that hinder global spatiotemporal modeling, leading to suboptimal understanding efficiency. We propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Model utilizing bidirectional attention to capture bidirectional dependencies. To further tackle the inference bottleneck of diffusion decoding on massive video tokens, we introduce MARS-Cache. This framework accelerates inference by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention, effectively pruning redundancy while preserving global connectivity via anchor tokens. Extensive experiments show VidLaDA outperforms diffusion baselines and rivals state-of-the-art autoregressive models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video), with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising reasoning accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Umar Salman, Mohammad Areeb Qazi, Mohammed Talha Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Quran MD, a comprehensive multimodal dataset of the Quran that integrates textual, linguistic, and audio dimensions at the verse and word levels. For each verse (ayah), the dataset provides its original Arabic text, English translation, and phonetic transliteration. To capture the rich oral tradition of Quranic recitation, we include verse-level audio from 32 distinct reciters, reflecting diverse recitation styles and dialectical nuances. At the word level, each token is paired with its corresponding Arabic script, English translation, transliteration, and an aligned audio recording, allowing fine-grained analysis of pronunciation, phonology, and semantic context. This dataset supports various applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, linguistic analysis, and digital Islamic studies. Bridging text and audio modalities across multiple reciters, this dataset provides a unique resource to advance computational approaches to Quranic recitation and study. Beyond enabling tasks such as ASR, tajweed detection, and Quranic TTS, it lays the foundation for multimodal embeddings, semantic retrieval, style transfer, and personalized tutoring systems that can support both research and community applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Buraaq/quran-audio-text-dataset</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyu Fan, Zhaoxiang Li, Yi Lu, Wang Chen, Qiu Shen, Xiao-xiao Long, Yinghao Cai, Tao Lu, Shuo Wang, Xun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation in cluttered scenes requires policies that remain stable under occlusions, viewpoint and scene variations. Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.
  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.
  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17895">Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Tan, Changjiang Sun, Xiage Qin, Hanat Adai, Zelin Fu, Tianxiang Zhou, Han Zhang, Yinghao Xu, Xing Zhu, Yujun Shen, Nan Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial visual perception is a fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as "masked" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on a range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities. We release the code, checkpoint, and 3M RGB-depth pairs (including 2M real data and 1M simulated data) to the community of spatial perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjun Zhang, Min Chen, Yibo Wei, Mingyu Dong, Yueqi Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction is to recover 3D signals from the sampled discrete 2D pixels, with the goal to converge continuous 3D spaces. In this paper, we revisit 3D reconstruction from the perspective of signal processing, identifying the periodic spectral extension induced by discrete sampling as the fundamental challenge. Previous 3D reconstruction kernels, such as Gaussians, Exponential functions, and Student's t distributions, serve as the low pass filters to isolate the baseband spectrum. However, their unideal low-pass property results in the overlap of high-frequency components with low-frequency components in the discrete-time signal's spectrum. To this end, we introduce Jinc kernel with an instantaneous drop to zero magnitude exactly at the cutoff frequency, which is corresponding to the ideal low pass filters. As Jinc kernel suffers from low decay speed in the spatial domain, we further propose modulated kernels to strick an effective balance, and achieves superior rendering performance by reconciling spatial efficiency and frequency-domain fidelity. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our Jinc and modulated kernels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Foster, Kirill Paramonov, Mete Ozay, Umberto Michieli</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is a paradigm where a model, initially trained on a dataset of base classes, must adapt to an expanding problem space by recognizing novel classes with limited data. We focus on the challenging FSCIL setup where a model receives only a single sample (1-shot) for each novel class and no further training or model alterations are allowed after the base training phase. This makes generalization to novel classes particularly difficult. We propose a novel approach predicated on the hypothesis that base and novel class embeddings have structural similarity. We map the original embedding space into a residual space by subtracting the class prototype (i.e., the average class embedding) of input samples. Then, we leverage generative modeling with VAE or diffusion models to learn the multi-modal distribution of residuals over the base classes, and we use this as a valuable structural prior to improve recognition of novel classes. Our approach, Gen1S, consistently improves novel class recognition over the state of the art across multiple benchmarks and backbone architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dain Kim, Jiwoo Lee, Jaehoon Yun, Yong Hoe Koo, Qingyu Chen, Hyunjae Kim, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold significant promise for medical applications, yet their deployment is often constrained by insufficient alignment and reliability. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a potent framework for refining model responses, its efficacy in high-stakes medical contexts remains underexplored, lacking the rigorous empirical groundwork necessary to guide future methodological advances. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive examination of diverse DPO variants within the medical domain, evaluating nine distinct formulations across two medical LVLMs: LLaVA-Med and HuatuoGPT-Vision. Our results reveal several critical limitations: current DPO approaches often yield inconsistent gains over supervised fine-tuning, with their efficacy varying significantly across different tasks and backbones. Furthermore, they frequently fail to resolve fundamental visual misinterpretation errors. Building on these insights, we present a targeted preference construction strategy as a proof-of-concept that explicitly addresses visual misinterpretation errors frequently observed in existing DPO models. This design yields a 3.6% improvement over the strongest existing DPO baseline on visual question-answering tasks. To support future research, we release our complete framework, including all training data, model checkpoints, and our codebase at https://github.com/dmis-lab/med-vlm-dpo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eashan Adhikarla, Brian D. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable image generation is fundamental to the success of modern generative AI, yet it faces a critical trade-off between semantic fidelity and inference speed. The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This control is further refined by a dual-SLERP blending technique and a goal-aware prompt enrichment pass from a Vision-Language Model. Second, for additional acceleration, we introduce a novel task-specific attention pruning mechanism. A lightweight pruning head learns to retain tokens essential to the edit, enabling effective optimization without the semantic degradation common in content-agnostic approaches. RemEdit surpasses prior state-of-the-art editing frameworks while maintaining real-time performance under 50% pruning. Consequently, RemEdit establishes a new benchmark for practical and powerful image editing. Source code: https://www.github.com/eashanadhikarla/RemEdit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vi Vu, Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Tien-Thinh Nguyen, Ba-Thinh Lam, Hoang-Thien Nguyen, Tianyang Wang, Xingjian Li, Min Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) show strong generalization, yet adapting them to medical images remains difficult due to domain shift, scarce labels, and the inability of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to exploit unlabeled data. While conventional models like U-Net excel in semi-supervised medical learning, their potential to assist a PEFT SAM has been largely overlooked. We introduce SC-SAM, a specialist-generalist framework where U-Net provides point-based prompts and pseudo-labels to guide SAM's adaptation, while SAM serves as a powerful generalist supervisor to regularize U-Net. This reciprocal guidance forms a bidirectional co-training loop that allows both models to effectively exploit the unlabeled data. Across prostate MRI and polyp segmentation benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming other existing semi-supervised SAM variants and even medical foundation models like MedSAM, highlighting the value of specialist-generalist cooperation for label-efficient medical image segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkun Sun, Jinqian Pan, Renjie Liang, Zhengkang Fan, Xin Miao, Jiang Bian, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical image segmentation, particularly in UNet-like architectures, upsampling is primarily used to transform smaller feature maps into larger ones, enabling feature fusion between encoder and decoder features and supporting multi-scale prediction. Conventional upsampling methods, such as transposed convolution and linear interpolation, operate on fixed positions: transposed convolution applies kernel elements to predetermined pixel or voxel locations, while linear interpolation assigns values based on fixed coordinates in the original feature map. These fixed-position approaches may fail to capture structural information beyond predefined sampling positions and can lead to artifacts or loss of detail. Inspired by deformable convolutions, we propose a novel upsampling method, Deformable Transposed Convolution (DTC), which learns dynamic coordinates (i.e., sampling positions) to generate high-resolution feature maps for both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Experiments on 3D (e.g., BTCV15) and 2D datasets (e.g., ISIC18, BUSI) demonstrate that DTC can be effectively integrated into existing medical image segmentation models, consistently improving the decoder's feature reconstruction and detail recovery capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bora Yimenicioglu, Vishal Manikanden</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanical properties of red blood cells (RBCs) are promising biomarkers for hematologic and systemic disease, motivating microfluidic assays that probe deformability at throughputs of $10^3$--$10^6$ cells per experiment. However, existing pipelines rely on supervised segmentation or hand-crafted kymographs and rarely encode the laminar Stokes-flow physics that governs RBC shape evolution. We introduce FlowMorph, a physics-consistent self-supervised framework that learns a label-free scalar mechanics proxy $k$ for each tracked RBC from short brightfield microfluidic videos. FlowMorph models each cell by a low-dimensional parametric contour, advances boundary points through a differentiable ''capsule-in-flow'' combining laminar advection and curvature-regularized elastic relaxation, and optimizes a loss coupling silhouette overlap, intra-cellular flow agreement, area conservation, wall constraints, and temporal smoothness, using only automatically derived silhouettes and optical flow.
  Across four public RBC microfluidic datasets, FlowMorph achieves a mean silhouette IoU of $0.905$ on physics-rich videos with provided velocity fields and markedly improves area conservation and wall violations over purely data-driven baselines. On $\sim 1.5\times 10^5$ centered sequences, the scalar $k$ alone separates tank-treading from flipping dynamics with an AUC of $0.863$. Using only $200$ real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) events for calibration, a monotone map $E=g(k)$ predicts apparent Young's modulus with a mean absolute error of $0.118$\,MPa on $600$ held-out cells and degrades gracefully under shifts in channel geometry, optics, and frame rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Walmer, Saksham Suri, Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: The space of task-agnostic feature upsampling has emerged as a promising area of research to efficiently create denser features from pre-trained visual backbones. These methods act as a shortcut to achieve dense features for a fraction of the cost by learning to map low-resolution features to high-resolution versions. While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs. We propose UPLiFT, an architecture for Universal Pixel-dense Lightweight Feature Transforms. We also propose an efficient Local Attender operator to overcome the limitations of prior iterative feature upsampling methods. This operator uses an alternative attentional pooling formulation defined fully locally. We show that our Local Attender allows UPLiFT to maintain stable features throughout upsampling, enabling state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs than existing pixel-dense feature upsamplers. In addition, we apply UPLiFT to generative downstream tasks and show that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Coupled Flow Matching models for VAE feature upsampling. Altogether, UPLiFT offers a versatile and efficient approach to creating denser features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinchen Gu, Nan Zhao, Lei Qiu, Lu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models increase representational capacity with modest computational cost, but their effectiveness in specialized domains such as medicine is limited by small datasets. In contrast, clinical practice offers rich expert knowledge, such as physician gaze patterns and diagnostic heuristics, that models cannot reliably learn from limited data. Combining data-driven experts, which capture novel patterns, with domain-expert-guided experts, which encode accumulated clinical insights, provides complementary strengths for robust and clinically meaningful learning. To this end, we propose Domain-Knowledge-Guided Hybrid MoE (DKGH-MoE), a plug-and-play and interpretable module that unifies data-driven learning with domain expertise. DKGH-MoE integrates a data-driven MoE to extract novel features from raw imaging data, and a domain-expert-guided MoE incorporates clinical priors, specifically clinician eye-gaze cues, to emphasize regions of high diagnostic relevance. By integrating domain expert insights with data-driven features, DKGH-MoE improves both performance and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aqsa Yousaf, Sint Sint Win, Megan Coffee, Habeeb Olufowobi</p>
<p>Abstract: Parasitic infections remain a pressing global health challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where diagnosis still depends on labor-intensive manual inspection of blood smears and the availability of expert domain knowledge. While deep learning models have shown strong performance in automating parasite detection, their clinical usefulness is constrained by limited interpretability. Existing explainability methods are largely restricted to visual heatmaps or attention maps, which highlight regions of interest but fail to capture the morphological traits that clinicians rely on for diagnosis. In this work, we present MorphXAI, an explainable framework that unifies parasite detection with fine-grained morphological analysis. MorphXAI integrates morphological supervision directly into the prediction pipeline, enabling the model to localize parasites while simultaneously characterizing clinically relevant attributes such as shape, curvature, visible dot count, flagellum presence, and developmental stage. To support this task, we curate a clinician-annotated dataset of three parasite species (Leishmania, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi) with detailed morphological labels, establishing a new benchmark for interpretable parasite analysis. Experimental results show that MorphXAI not only improves detection performance over the baseline but also provides structured, biologically meaningful explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asiegbu Miracle Kanu-Asiegbu, Nitin Jotwani, Xiaoxiao Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection is a critical task in robot perception. Multispectral modalities (visible light and thermal) can boost pedestrian detection performance by providing complementary visual information. Several gaps remain with multispectral pedestrian detection methods. First, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial fusion and often neglect temporal information. Second, RGB and thermal image pairs in multispectral benchmarks may not always be perfectly aligned. Pedestrians are also challenging to detect due to varying lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. This work proposes Strip-Fusion, a spatial-temporal fusion network that is robust to misalignment in input images, as well as varying lighting conditions and heavy occlusions. The Strip-Fusion pipeline integrates temporally adaptive convolutions to dynamically weigh spatial-temporal features, enabling our model to better capture pedestrian motion and context over time. A novel Kullback-Leibler divergence loss was designed to mitigate modality imbalance between visible and thermal inputs, guiding feature alignment toward the more informative modality during training. Furthermore, a novel post-processing algorithm was developed to reduce false positives. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs competitively for both the KAIST and the CVC-14 benchmarks. We also observed significant improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art on challenging conditions such as heavy occlusion and misalignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in medical images is essential for analyzing morphological patterns in clinical applications. Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation. Our design is flexible and can be seamlessly combined with other topology-based methods to further enhance segmentation performance. Experimental results show that integrating topological features enhances model robustness, effectively handling challenges like overexposure and blurring in medical imaging. Our approach on three curvilinear benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and topological fidelity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in semi-supervised hyperspectral image (HSI) classification regarding feature extraction and classification performance. However, due to high annotation costs and limited sample availability, semi-supervised learning still faces challenges such as boundary label diffusion and pseudo-label instability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised hyperspectral classification framework integrating spatial prior information with a dynamic learning mechanism. First, we design an Edge-Aware Superpixel Label Propagation (EASLP) module. By integrating edge intensity penalty with neighborhood correction strategy, it mitigates label diffusion from superpixel segmentation while enhancing classification robustness in boundary regions. Second, we introduce a Dynamic History-Fused Prediction (DHP) method. By maintaining historical predictions and dynamically weighting them with current results, DHP smoothens pseudo-label fluctuations and improves temporal consistency and noise resistance. Concurrently, incorporating condifence and consistency measures, the Adaptive Tripartite Sample Categorization (ATSC) strategy implements hierarchical utilization of easy, ambiguous, and hard samples, leading to enhanced pseudo-label quality and learning efficiency. The Dynamic Reliability-Enhanced Pseudo-Label Framework (DREPL), composed of DHP and ATSC, strengthens pseudo-label stability across temporal and sample domains. Through synergizes operation with EASLP, it achieves spatio-temporal consistency optimization. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate its capability to maintain superior classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianshu Chao, Tianhua Lv, Qiqiong Ma, Yunfei Qiu, Li Fang, Huifang Shen, Wei Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has demonstrated considerable potential in hyperspectral representation, yet its application in cross-domain transfer scenarios remains under-explored. Existing methods, however, still rely on source domain annotations and are susceptible to distribution shifts, leading to degraded generalization performance in the target domain. To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism. This aligns semantic evolution trajectories through a teacher-student structure, enabling robust transfer learning under low-label conditions. Experimental results demonstrate stable classification performance and strong cross-domain adaptability across four hyperspectral datasets, validating the method's effectiveness under resource-constrained conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Yang, Haozhao Ma, Xu Han, Yuan Yuan, Qi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: To pursue an efficient text assembling process, existing methods detect texts via the shrink-mask expansion strategy. However, the shrinking operation loses the visual features of text margins and confuses the foreground and background difference, which brings intrinsic limitations to recognize text features. We follow this issue and design Text-Pass Filter (TPF) for arbitrary-shaped text detection. It segments the whole text directly, which avoids the intrinsic limitations. It is noteworthy that different from previous whole text region-based methods, TPF can separate adhesive texts naturally without complex decoding or post-processing processes, which makes it possible for real-time text detection. Concretely, we find that the band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its passband but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band. It provides a natural idea for extracting whole texts separately. By simulating the band-pass filter, TPF constructs a unique feature-filter pair for each text. In the inference stage, every filter extracts the corresponding matched text by passing its pass-feature and blocking other features. Meanwhile, considering the large aspect ratio problem of ribbon-like texts makes it hard to recognize texts wholly, a Reinforcement Ensemble Unit (REU) is designed to enhance the feature consistency of the same text and to enlarge the filter's recognition field to help recognize whole texts. Furthermore, a Foreground Prior Unit (FPU) is introduced to encourage TPF to discriminate the difference between the foreground and background, which improves the feature-filter pair quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of REU and FPU while showing the TPF's superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akbar Saadat</p>
<p>Abstract: Following the earlier verification for Gaussian model in \cite{ASaa2026}, this paper introduces a zero training forward computational framework for the model to realize it in real time applications. The framework is based on discrete calculation of the analytic expression of the defocused image from the sharper one for the application range of the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernels and selecting the best matches. The analytic expression yields multiple solutions at certain image points, but is filtered down to a single solution using similarity measures over neighboring points.The framework is structured to handle cases where two given images are partial blurred versions of each other. Experimental evaluations on real images demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) below $1.7\%$ in estimating synthetic blur values. Furthermore, the discrepancy between actual blurred image intensities and their corresponding estimates remains under $2\%$, obtained by applying the extracted defocus filters to less blurred images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Tribble, Hao Wang, Si-En Hong, Chaoyi Zhou, Ashish Bastola, Siyu Huang, Abolfazl Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon egocentric video presents significant challenges for visual navigation due to viewpoint drift and the absence of persistent geometric context. Although recent vision-language models perform well on image and short-video reasoning, their spatial reasoning capability in long egocentric sequences remains limited. In this work, we study how explicit spatial signals influence VLM-based video understanding without modifying model architectures or inference procedures. We introduce Sanpo-D, a fine-grained re-annotation of the Google Sanpo dataset, and benchmark multiple VLMs on navigation-oriented spatial queries. To examine input-level inductive bias, we further fuse depth maps with RGB frames and evaluate their impact on spatial reasoning. Our results reveal a trade-off between general-purpose accuracy and spatial specialization, showing that depth-aware and spatially grounded representations can improve performance on safety-critical tasks such as pedestrian and obstruction detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to silence in early stages, lung cancer has been one of the most leading causes of mortality in cancer patients world-wide. Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Lyu, Minghua Zhao, Xuewen Huang, Yifei Chen, Shuangli Du, Jing Hu, Cheng Shi, Zhiyong Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: As a crucial element of public security, video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to measure deviations from normal patterns for various events in real-time surveillance systems. However, most existing VAD methods rely on large-scale models to pursue extreme accuracy, limiting their feasibility on resource-limited edge devices. Moreover, mainstream prediction-based VAD detects anomalies using only single-frame future prediction errors, overlooking the richer constraints from longer-term temporal forward information. In this paper, we introduce FoGA, a lightweight VAD model that performs Forward consistency learning with Gated context Aggregation, containing about 2M parameters and tailored for potential edge devices. Specifically, we propose a Unet-based method that performs feature extraction on consecutive frames to generate both immediate and forward predictions. Then, we introduce a gated context aggregation module into the skip connections to dynamically fuse encoder and decoder features at the same spatial scale. Finally, the model is jointly optimized with a novel forward consistency loss, and a hybrid anomaly measurement strategy is adopted to integrate errors from both immediate and forward frames for more accurate detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods, running up to 155 FPS. Hence, our FoGA achieves an excellent trade-off between performance and the efficiency metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Rege, Arka Sadhu, Yuliang Li, Kejie Li, Ramya Korlakai Vinayak, Yuning Chai, Yong Jae Lee, Hyo Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of always-on personal AI assistants, enabled by all-day wearable devices such as smart glasses, demands a new level of contextual understanding, one that goes beyond short, isolated events to encompass the continuous, longitudinal stream of egocentric video. Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips a planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehua Liu, Shihao Zou, Jincai Huang, Yanfang Zhang, Chao Tong, Weixin Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a preferred treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma and other liver malignancies, yet it remains a highly challenging procedure due to complex intra-operative vascular navigation and anatomical variability. Accurate and robust 2D-3D vessel registration is essential to guide microcatheter and instruments during TACE, enabling precise localization of vascular structures and optimal therapeutic targeting. To tackle this issue, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration strategy. First, we introduce a global alignment module, structure-aware perspective n-point (SA-PnP), to establish correspondence between 2D and 3D vessel structures. Second, we propose TempDiffReg, a temporal diffusion model that performs vessel deformation iteratively by leveraging temporal context to capture complex anatomical variations and local structural changes. We collected data from 23 patients and constructed 626 paired multi-frame samples for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Specifically, our method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.63 mm and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 mm in registration accuracy, representing 66.7\% lower MSE and 17.7\% lower MAE compared to the most competitive existing approaches. It has the potential to assist less-experienced clinicians in safely and efficiently performing complex TACE procedures, ultimately enhancing both surgical outcomes and patient care.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Huang, Yujuan Tan, Weisheng Li, Shitai Shan, Liu Liu, Bo Liu, Linlin Shen, Jing Yu, Yue Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: One-stage object detection, particularly the YOLO series, strikes a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, existing YOLO detectors lack explicit modeling of heterogeneous object responses within shared feature channels, which limits further performance gains. To address this, we propose YOLO-DS, a framework built around a novel Dual-Statistic Synergy Operator (DSO). The DSO decouples object features by jointly modeling the channel-wise mean and the peak-to-mean difference. Building upon the DSO, we design two lightweight gating modules: the Dual-Statistic Synergy Gating (DSG) module for adaptive channel-wise feature selection, and the Multi-Path Segmented Gating (MSG) module for depth-wise feature weighting. On the MS-COCO benchmark, YOLO-DS consistently outperforms YOLOv8 across five model scales (N, S, M, L, X), achieving AP gains of 1.1% to 1.7% with only a minimal increase in inference latency. Extensive visualization, ablation, and comparative studies validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superior capability in discriminating heterogeneous objects with high efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiye Zhu, Zekai Zhang, Xiangchen Wang, Hewei Pan, Teng Wang, Tiantian Geng, Rongtao Xu, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to interpret natural language instructions and act coherently in visually rich environments. However, most existing methods rely on reactive state-action mappings without explicitly modeling how actions causally transform subsequent visual observations. Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \textsc{NaVIDA} (\textbf{Nav}igation with \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{D}ynamics \textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution. \textsc{NaVIDA} augments training with chunk-based inverse-dynamics supervision to learn causal relationship between visual changes and corresponding actions. To structure this supervision and extend the effective planning range, \textsc{NaVIDA} employs hierarchical probabilistic action chunking (HPAC), which organizes trajectories into multi-step chunks and provides discriminative, longer-range visual-change cues. To further curb error accumulation and stabilize behavior at inference, an entropy-guided mechanism adaptively sets the execution horizon of action chunks. Extensive experiments show that \textsc{NaVIDA} achieves superior navigation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters (3B vs. 8B). Real-world robot evaluations further validate the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Code and data will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Li, Shiying Wang, Jianqiang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models like CLIP have significantly advanced Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR). However, existing methods predominantly rely on coarse-grained global alignment, which often overlooks the dense, multi-scale semantics inherent in overhead imagery. Moreover, adapting these heavy models via full fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational costs and risks catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MPS-CLIP, a parameter-efficient framework designed to shift the retrieval paradigm from global matching to keyword-guided fine-grained alignment. Specifically, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract core semantic keywords, guiding the Segment Anything Model (SamGeo) to generate semantically relevant sub-perspectives. To efficiently adapt the frozen backbone, we introduce a Gated Global Attention (G^2A) adapter, which captures global context and long-range dependencies with minimal overhead. Furthermore, a Multi-Perspective Representation (MPR) module aggregates these local cues into robust multi-perspective embeddings. The framework is optimized via a hybrid objective combining multi-perspective contrastive and weighted triplet losses, which dynamically selects maximum-response perspectives to suppress noise and enforce precise semantic matching. Extensive experiments on the RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that MPS-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35.18% and 48.40% mean Recall (mR), respectively, significantly outperforming full fine-tuning baselines and recent competitive methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian-Yi Zhou, Xuan-Hao Liu, Bao-Liang Lu, Wei-Long Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing human dynamic visual perception from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is of great research significance since EEG's non-invasiveness and high temporal resolution. However, EEG-to-video reconstruction remains challenging due to: 1) Single Modality: existing studies solely align EEG signals with the text modality, which ignores other modalities and are prone to suffer from overfitting problems; 2) Data Scarcity: current methods often have difficulty training to converge with limited EEG-video data. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel framework MindCine to achieve high-fidelity video reconstructions on limited data. We employ a multimodal joint learning strategy to incorporate beyond-text modalities in the training stage and leverage a pre-trained large EEG model to relieve the data scarcity issue for decoding semantic information, while a Seq2Seq model with causal attention is specifically designed for decoding perceptual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, the results underscore the effectiveness of the complementary strengths of different modalities and demonstrate that leveraging a large-scale EEG model can further enhance reconstruction performance by alleviating the challenges associated with limited data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhan Cao, Wei Sun, Weixia Zhang, Xiangyang Zhu, Kaiwei Zhang, Jun Jia, Dandan Zhu, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual quality assessment (VQA) is increasingly shifting from scalar score prediction toward interpretable quality understanding -- a paradigm that demands \textit{fine-grained spatiotemporal perception} and \textit{auxiliary contextual information}. Current approaches rely on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning on curated instruction datasets, which involve labor-intensive annotation and are prone to dataset-specific biases. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{QualiRAG}, a \textit{training-free} \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration \textbf{(RAG)} framework that systematically leverages the latent perceptual knowledge of large multimodal models (LMMs) for visual quality perception. Unlike conventional RAG that retrieves from static corpora, QualiRAG dynamically generates auxiliary knowledge by decomposing questions into structured requests and constructing four complementary knowledge sources: \textit{visual metadata}, \textit{subject localization}, \textit{global quality summaries}, and \textit{local quality descriptions}, followed by relevance-aware retrieval for evidence-grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments show that QualiRAG achieves substantial improvements over open-source general-purpose LMMs and VQA-finetuned LMMs on visual quality understanding tasks, and delivers competitive performance on visual quality comparison tasks, demonstrating robust quality assessment capabilities without any task-specific training.

<p>Abstract: Deep homography estimation has broad applications in computer vision and robotics. Remarkable progresses have been achieved while the existing methods typically treat it as a direct regression or iterative refinement problem and often struggling to capture complex geometric transformations or generalize across different domains. In this work, we propose HomoFM, a new framework that introduces the flow matching technique from generative modeling into the homography estimation task for the first time. Unlike the existing methods, we formulate homography estimation problem as a velocity field learning problem. By modeling a continuous and point-wise velocity field that transforms noisy distributions into registered coordinates, the proposed network recovers high-precision transformations through a conditional flow trajectory. Furthermore, to address the challenge of domain shifts issue, e.g., the cases of multimodal matching or varying illumination scenarios, we integrate a gradient reversal layer (GRL) into the feature extraction backbone. This domain adaptation strategy explicitly constrains the encoder to learn domain-invariant representations, significantly enhancing the network's robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that HomoFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both estimation accuracy and robustness on standard benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Detection of human emotions based on facial images in real-world scenarios is a difficult task due to low image quality, variations in lighting, pose changes, background distractions, small inter-class variations, noisy crowd-sourced labels, and severe class imbalance, as observed in the FER-2013 dataset of 48x48 grayscale images. Although recent approaches using large CNNs such as VGG and ResNet achieve reasonable accuracy, they are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their practicality for real-time applications. We address these challenges using a lightweight and efficient facial emotion recognition pipeline based on EfficientNetB2, trained using a two-stage warm-up and fine-tuning strategy. The model is enhanced with AdamW optimization, decoupled weight decay, label smoothing (epsilon = 0.06) to reduce annotation noise, and clipped class weights to mitigate class imbalance, along with dropout, mixed-precision training, and extensive real-time data augmentation. The model is trained using a stratified 87.5%/12.5% train-validation split while keeping the official test set intact, achieving a test accuracy of 68.78% with nearly ten times fewer parameters than VGG16-based baselines. Experimental results, including per-class metrics and learning dynamics, demonstrate stable training and strong generalization, making the proposed approach suitable for real-time and edge-based applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyuan Jin, Zehui Liao, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capability in assisting disease diagnosis in medical visual question answering (VQA). However, their outputs remain vulnerable to hallucinations (i.e., responses that contradict visual facts), posing significant risks in high-stakes medical scenarios. Recent introspective detection methods, particularly uncertainty-based approaches, offer computational efficiency but are fundamentally indirect, as they estimate predictive uncertainty for an image-question pair rather than verifying the factual correctness of a specific answer. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Logical Loop Verification (V-Loop), a training-free and plug-and-play framework for hallucination detection in medical VQA. V-Loop introduces a bidirectional reasoning process that forms a visually grounded logical loop to verify factual correctness. Given an input, the MLLM produces an answer for the primary input pair. V-Loop extracts semantic units from the primary QA pair, generates a verification question by conditioning on the answer unit to re-query the question unit, and enforces visual attention consistency to ensure answering both primary question and verification question rely on the same image evidence. If the verification answer matches the expected semantic content, the logical loop closes, indicating factual grounding; otherwise, the primary answer is flagged as hallucinated. Extensive experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks and MLLMs show that V-Loop consistently outperforms existing introspective methods, remains highly efficient, and further boosts uncertainty-based approaches when used in combination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zerui Kang, Yishen Lim, Zhouyou Gu, Seung-Woo Ko, Tony Q. S. Quek, Jihong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate radio-frequency (RF) material parameters are essential for electromagnetic digital twins in 6G systems, yet gradient-based inverse ray tracing (RT) remains sensitive to initialization and costly under limited measurements. This paper proposes a vision-language-model (VLM) guided framework that accelerates and stabilizes multi-material parameter estimation in a differentiable RT (DRT) engine. A VLM parses scene images to infer material categories and maps them to quantitative priors via an ITU-R material table, yielding informed conductivity initializations. The VLM further selects informative transmitter/receiver placements that promote diverse, material-discriminative paths. Starting from these priors, the DRT performs gradient-based refinement using measured received signal strengths. Experiments in NVIDIA Sionna on indoor scenes show 2-4$\times$ faster convergence and 10-100$\times$ lower final parameter error compared with uniform or random initialization and random placement baselines, achieving sub-0.1\% mean relative error with only a few receivers. Complexity analyses indicate per-iteration time scales near-linearly with the number of materials and measurement setups, while VLM-guided placement reduces the measurements required for accurate recovery. Ablations over RT depth and ray counts confirm further accuracy gains without significant per-iteration overhead. Results demonstrate that semantic priors from VLMs effectively guide physics-based optimization for fast and reliable RF material estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders represent a leading cause of global disability, creating an urgent demand for precise interpretation of medical imaging. Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Xuanying Li, Cheng Dai, Jinglei Feng, Yuxiang Luo, Yuqi Ouyang, Hao Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Wireframe parsing aims to recover line segments and their junctions to form a structured geometric representation useful for downstream tasks such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Existing methods predict lines and junctions separately and reconcile them post-hoc, causing mismatches and reduced robustness. We present Co-PLNet, a point-line collaborative framework that exchanges spatial cues between the two tasks, where early detections are converted into spatial prompts via a Point-Line Prompt Encoder (PLP-Encoder), which encodes geometric attributes into compact and spatially aligned maps. A Cross-Guidance Line Decoder (CGL-Decoder) then refines predictions with sparse attention conditioned on complementary prompts, enforcing point-line consistency and efficiency. Experiments on Wireframe and YorkUrban show consistent improvements in accuracy and robustness, together with favorable real-time efficiency, demonstrating our effectiveness for structured geometry perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eytan Kats, Kai Geissler, Daniel Mensing, Jochen G. Hirsch, Stefan Heldman, Mattias P. Heinrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated patient positioning plays an important role in optimizing scanning procedure and improving patient throughput. Leveraging depth information captured by RGB-D cameras presents a promising approach for estimating internal organ positions, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient positioning. In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that directly predicts the 3D locations and shapes of multiple internal organs from single 2D depth images of the body surface. Utilizing a large-scale dataset of full-body MRI scans, we synthesize depth images paired with corresponding anatomical segmentations to train a unified convolutional neural network architecture. Our method accurately localizes a diverse set of anatomical structures, including bones and soft tissues, without requiring explicit surface reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of integrating depth sensors into radiology workflows to streamline scanning procedures and enhance patient experience through automated patient positioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhajeet Das, Susmita Ghosh, Abhiroop Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial images play a vital role in urban planning and environmental preservation, as they consist of various structures, representing different types of buildings, forests, mountains, and unoccupied lands. Due to its heterogeneous nature, developing robust models for scene classification remains a challenge. In this study, we conduct a literature review of various machine learning methods for aerial image classification. Our survey covers a range of approaches from handcrafted features (e.g., SIFT, LBP) to traditional CNNs (e.g., VGG, GoogLeNet), and advanced deep hybrid networks. In this connection, we have also designed Aerial-Y-Net, a spatial attention-enhanced CNN with multi-scale feature fusion mechanism, which acts as an attention-based model and helps us to better understand the complexities of aerial images. Evaluated on the AID dataset, our model achieves 91.72% accuracy, outperforming several baseline architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedali Mousavi, Seyedhamidreza Mousavi, Masoud Daneshtalab</p>
<p>Abstract: Range-view projection provides an efficient method for transforming 3D LiDAR point clouds into 2D range image representations, enabling effective processing with 2D deep learning models. However, a major challenge in this projection is the many-to-one conflict, where multiple 3D points are mapped onto the same pixel in the range image, requiring a selection strategy. Existing approaches typically retain the point with the smallest depth (closest to the LiDAR), disregarding semantic relevance and object structure, which leads to the loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we extend the depth-based selection rule by incorporating contextual information from both instance centers and class labels, introducing two mechanisms: \textit{Centerness-Aware Projection (CAP)} and \textit{Class-Weighted-Aware Projection (CWAP)}. In CAP, point depths are adjusted according to their distance from the instance center, thereby prioritizing central instance points over noisy boundary and background points. In CWAP, object classes are prioritized through user-defined weights, offering flexibility in the projection strategy. Our evaluations on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that CAP preserves more instance points during projection, achieving up to a 3.1\% mIoU improvement compared to the baseline. Furthermore, CWAP enhances the performance of targeted classes while having a negligible impact on the performance of other classes</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Wang, Siyuan Su, Quantong Fu, Yongxiang Hu, Yangfan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents for automating GUI interaction tasks, substantial research focused on improving GUI perception to ground task instructions into concrete action steps. However, the step execution capability of these agents has gradually emerged as a new bottleneck for task completion. In particular, existing GUI agents often adopt overly simplified strategies for handling swipe interactions, preventing them from accurately replicating human-like behavior. To address this limitation, we decompose human swipe gestures into multiple quantifiable dimensions and propose an automated pipeline SwipeGen to synthesize human-like swipe interactions through GUI exploration. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the first benchmark for evaluating the swipe execution capability of GUI agents. Furthermore, leveraging the synthesized data, we propose GUISwiper, a GUI agent with enhanced interaction execution capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that GUISwiper achieves a swipe execution accuracy of 69.07%, representing a 214% improvement over existing VLM baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ali Shah (Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan), Muhammad Mansoor Alam (Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan, Multimedia University, Malaysia), Saddam Hussain Khan (University of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Swat, Kanju Township, Pakistan)</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes an efficient Densely Swin Hybrid (EDSH) framework for brain tumor MRI analysis, designed to jointly capture fine grained texture patterns and long range contextual dependencies. Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale MRI dataset (stringent 40,260 images across four tumor classes) demonstrates consistent superiority over standalone CNNs, Vision Transformers, and hybrids, achieving 98.50 accuracy and recall on the test unseen dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Deutsch, Nicolas Mo\"enne-Loccoz, Gavriel State, Zan Gojcic</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction methods remain highly sensitive to photometric inconsistencies arising from camera optical characteristics and variations in image signal processing (ISP). Existing mitigation strategies such as per-frame latent variables or affine color corrections lack physical grounding and generalize poorly to novel views. We propose the Physically-Plausible ISP (PPISP) correction module, which disentangles camera-intrinsic and capture-dependent effects through physically based and interpretable transformations. A dedicated PPISP controller, trained on the input views, predicts ISP parameters for novel viewpoints, analogous to auto exposure and auto white balance in real cameras. This design enables realistic and fair evaluation on novel views without access to ground-truth images. PPISP achieves SoTA performance on standard benchmarks, while providing intuitive control and supporting the integration of metadata when available.

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in text-driven video editing, generating coherent non-rigid deformations remains a critical challenge, often plagued by physical distortion and temporal flicker. To bridge this gap, we propose NRVBench, the first dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate non-rigid video editing. First, we curate a high-quality dataset consisting of 180 non-rigid motion videos from six physics-based categories, equipped with 2,340 fine-grained task instructions and 360 multiple-choice questions. Second, we propose NRVE-Acc, a novel evaluation metric based on Vision-Language Models that can rigorously assess physical compliance, temporal consistency, and instruction alignment, overcoming the limitations of general metrics in capturing complex dynamics. Third, we introduce a training-free baseline, VM-Edit, which utilizes a dual-region denoising mechanism to achieve structure-aware control, balancing structural preservation and dynamic deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while current methods have shortcomings in maintaining physical plausibility, our method achieves excellent performance across both standard and proposed metrics. We believe the benchmark could serve as a standard testing platform for advancing physics-aware video editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijing Wu, Yunhao Li, Zicheng Zhang, Qi Jia, Xinyue Li, Huiyu Duan, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on existing low-level vision benchmarks, which primarily focus on generic images. However, their capabilities to perceive and assess portrait images, a domain characterized by distinct structural and perceptual properties, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce Q-Bench-Portrait, the first holistic benchmark specifically designed for portrait image quality perception, comprising 2,765 image-question-answer triplets and featuring (1) diverse portrait image sources, including natural, synthetic distortion, AI-generated, artistic, and computer graphics images; (2) comprehensive quality dimensions, covering technical distortions, AIGC-specific distortions, and aesthetics; and (3) a range of question formats, including single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions, at both global and local levels. Based on Q-Bench-Portrait, we evaluate 20 open-source and 5 closed-source MLLMs, revealing that although current models demonstrate some competence in portrait image perception, their performance remains limited and imprecise, with a clear gap relative to human judgments. We hope that the proposed benchmark will foster further research into enhancing the portrait image perception capabilities of both general-purpose and domain-specific MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present OREHAS (Optimized Recognition & Evaluation of volumetric Hydrops in the Auditory System), the first fully automatic pipeline for volumetric quantification of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) from routine 3D-SPACE-MRC and 3D-REAL-IR MRI. The system integrates three components -- slice classification, inner ear localization, and sequence-specific segmentation -- into a single workflow that computes per-ear endolymphatic-to-vestibular volume ratios (ELR) directly from whole MRI volumes, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
  Trained with only 3 to 6 annotated slices per patient, OREHAS generalized effectively to full 3D volumes, achieving Dice scores of 0.90 for SPACE-MRC and 0.75 for REAL-IR. In an external validation cohort with complete manual annotations, OREHAS closely matched expert ground truth (VSI = 74.3%) and substantially outperformed the clinical syngo.via software (VSI = 42.5%), which tended to overestimate endolymphatic volumes. Across 19 test patients, vestibular measurements from OREHAS were consistent with syngo.via, while endolymphatic volumes were systematically smaller and more physiologically realistic.
  These results show that reliable and reproducible EH quantification can be achieved from standard MRI using limited supervision. By combining efficient deep-learning-based segmentation with a clinically aligned volumetric workflow, OREHAS reduces operator dependence, ensures methodological consistency. Besides, the results are compatible with established imaging protocols. The approach provides a robust foundation for large-scale studies and for recalibrating clinical diagnostic thresholds based on accurate volumetric measurements of the inner ear.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Petrou, Harris Partaourides, Athanasios Balomenos, Yannis Kopsinis, Sotirios Chatzis</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze prediction plays a critical role in Virtual Reality (VR) applications by reducing sensor-induced latency and enabling computationally demanding techniques such as foveated rendering, which rely on anticipating user attention. However, direct eye tracking is often unavailable due to hardware limitations or privacy concerns. To address this, we present a novel gaze prediction framework that combines Head-Mounted Display (HMD) motion signals with visual saliency cues derived from video frames. Our method employs UniSal, a lightweight saliency encoder, to extract visual features, which are then fused with HMD motion data and processed through a time-series prediction module. We evaluate two lightweight architectures, TSMixer and LSTM, for forecasting future gaze directions. Experiments on the EHTask dataset, along with deployment on commercial VR hardware, show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines such as Center-of-HMD and Mean Gaze. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of predictive gaze modeling in reducing perceptual lag and enhancing natural interaction in VR environments where direct eye tracking is constrained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rinka Kawano, Masaki Kawamura</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital watermarking techniques are essential to prevent unauthorized use of images. Since pirated images are often geometrically distorted by operations such as scaling and cropping, accurate synchronization - detecting the embedding position of the watermark - is critical for proper extraction. In particular, cropping changes the origin of the image, making synchronization difficult. However, few existing methods are robust against cropping. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking method that estimates geometric transformations applied to a stego image using a pilot signal, allowing synchronization even after cropping. A grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values is embedded in the image. When the image is transformed, the grid is also distorted. By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Lee Jun Rong, Christos Korgialas, Dion Jia Xu Ho, Pai Chet Ng, Xiaoxiao Miao, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing automated attack suites operate as static ensembles with fixed sequences, lacking strategic adaptation and semantic awareness. This paper introduces the Agentic Reasoning for Methods Orchestration and Reparameterization (ARMOR) framework to address these limitations. ARMOR orchestrates three canonical adversarial primitives, Carlini-Wagner (CW), Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), and Spatially Transformed Attacks (STA) via Vision Language Models (VLM)-guided agents that collaboratively generate and synthesize perturbations through a shared ``Mixing Desk". Large Language Models (LLMs) adaptively tune and reparameterize parallel attack agents in a real-time, closed-loop system that exploits image-specific semantic vulnerabilities. On standard benchmarks, ARMOR achieves improved cross-architecture transfer and reliably fools both settings, delivering a blended output for blind targets and selecting the best attack or blended attacks for white-box targets using a confidence-and-SSIM score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Rempe, Lukas T. Rotkopf, Marco Schlimbach, Helmut Becker, Fabian H\"orst, Johannes Haubold, Philipp Dammann, Kevin Kr\"oninger, Jens Kleesiek</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning applications in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) predominantly operate on reconstructed magnitude images, a process that discards phase information and requires computationally expensive transforms. Standard neural network architectures rely on local operations (convolutions or grid-patches) that are ill-suited for the global, non-local nature of raw frequency-domain (k-Space) data. In this work, we propose a novel complex-valued Vision Transformer (kViT) designed to perform classification directly on k-Space data. To bridge the geometric disconnect between current architectures and MRI physics, we introduce a radial k-Space patching strategy that respects the spectral energy distribution of the frequency-domain. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and in-house datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves classification performance competitive with state-of-the-art image-domain baselines (ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT). Crucially, kViT exhibits superior robustness to high acceleration factors and offers a paradigm shift in computational efficiency, reducing VRAM consumption during training by up to 68$\times$ compared to standard methods. This establishes a pathway for resource-efficient, direct-from-scanner AI analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18407">Larger than memory image processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jon Sporring, David Stansby</p>
<p>Abstract: This report addresses larger-than-memory image analysis for petascale datasets such as 1.4 PB electron-microscopy volumes and 150 TB human-organ atlases. We argue that performance is fundamentally I/O-bound. We show that structuring analysis as streaming passes over data is crucial. For 3D volumes, two representations are popular: stacks of 2D slices (e.g., directories or multi-page TIFF) and 3D chunked layouts (e.g., Zarr/HDF5). While for a few algorithms, chunked layout on disk is crucial to keep disk I/O at a minimum, we show how the slice-based streaming architecture can be built on top of either image representation in a manner that minimizes disk I/O. This is in particular advantageous for algorithms relying on neighbouring values, since the slicing streaming architecture is 1D, which implies that there are only 2 possible sweeping orders, both of which are aligned with the order in which images are read from the disk. This is in contrast to 3D chunks, in which any sweep cannot be done without accessing each chunk at least 9 times. We formalize this with sweep-based execution (natural 2D/3D orders), windowed operations, and overlap-aware tiling to minimize redundant access. Building on these principles, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes algorithms with intrinsic knowledge of their optimal streaming and memory use; the DSL performs compile-time and run-time pipeline analyses to automatically select window sizes, fuse stages, tee and zip streams, and schedule passes for limited-RAM machines, yielding near-linear I/O scans and predictable memory footprints. The approach integrates with existing tooling for segmentation and morphology but reframes pre/post-processing as pipelines that privilege sequential read/write patterns, delivering substantial throughput gains for extremely large images without requiring full-volume residency in memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in expressing emotions and communication, particularly during early childhood. Understanding the affective state of children at an early age remains challenging, as conventional assessment methods are often intrusive, subjective, or difficult to apply consistently. This paper builds upon previous work on affective state recognition from children's drawings by presenting a comparative evaluation of machine learning models for emotion classification. Three deep learning architectures -- MobileNet, EfficientNet, and VGG16 -- are evaluated within a unified experimental framework to analyze classification performance, robustness, and computational efficiency. The models are trained using transfer learning on a dataset of children's drawings annotated with emotional labels provided by psychological experts. The results highlight important trade-offs between lightweight and deeper architectures when applied to drawing-based affective computing tasks, particularly in mobile and real-time application contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lloyd Austin Courtenay</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric morphometrics (GMM) is widely used to quantify shape variation, more recently serving as input for machine learning (ML) analyses. Standard practice aligns all specimens via Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) prior to splitting data into training and test sets, potentially introducing statistical dependence and contaminating downstream predictive models. Here, the effects of GPA-induced contamination are formally characterised using controlled 2D and 3D simulations across varying sample sizes, landmark densities, and allometric patterns. A novel realignment procedure is proposed, whereby test specimens are aligned to the training set prior to model fitting, eliminating cross-sample dependency. Simulations reveal a robust "diagonal" in sample-size vs. landmark-space, reflecting the scaling of RMSE under isotropic variation, with slopes analytically derived from the degrees of freedom in Procrustes tangent space. The importance of spatial autocorrelation among landmarks is further demonstrated using linear and convolutional regression models, highlighting performance degradation when landmark relationships are ignored. This work establishes the need for careful preprocessing in ML applications of GMM, provides practical guidelines for realignment, and clarifies fundamental statistical constraints inherent to Procrustes shape space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating holistic co-speech gestures that integrate full-body motion with facial expressions suffers from semantically incoherent coordination on body motion and spatially unstable meaningless movements due to existing part-decomposed or frame-level regression methods, We introduce 3DGesPolicy, a novel action-based framework that reformulates holistic gesture generation as a continuous trajectory control problem through diffusion policy from robotics. By modeling frame-to-frame variations as unified holistic actions, our method effectively learns inter-frame holistic gesture motion patterns and ensures both spatially and semantically coherent movement trajectories that adhere to realistic motion manifolds. To further bridge the gap in expressive alignment, we propose a Gesture-Audio-Phoneme (GAP) fusion module that can deeply integrate and refine multi-modal signals, ensuring structured and fine-grained alignment between speech semantics, body motion, and facial expressions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the BEAT2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our 3DGesPolicy across other state-of-the-art methods in generating natural, expressive, and highly speech-aligned holistic gestures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is a top cause of irreversible blindness globally, making early detection and longitudinal follow-up pivotal to preventing permanent vision loss. Current screening and progression assessment, however, rely on single tests or loosely linked examinations, introducing subjectivity and fragmented care. Limited access to high-quality imaging tools and specialist expertise further compromises consistency and equity in real-world use. To address these gaps, we developed Fair-Eye Net, a fair, reliable multimodal AI system closing the clinical loop from glaucoma screening to follow-up and risk alerting. It integrates fundus photos, OCT structural metrics, VF functional indices, and demographic factors via a dual-stream heterogeneous fusion architecture, with an uncertainty-aware hierarchical gating strategy for selective prediction and safe referral. A fairness constraint reduces missed diagnoses in disadvantaged subgroups. Experimental results show it achieved an AUC of 0.912 (96.7% specificity), cut racial false-negativity disparity by 73.4% (12.31% to 3.28%), maintained stable cross-domain performance, and enabled 3-12 months of early risk alerts (92% sensitivity, 88% specificity). Unlike post hoc fairness adjustments, Fair-Eye Net optimizes fairness as a primary goal with clinical reliability via multitask learning, offering a reproducible path for clinical translation and large-scale deployment to advance global eye health equity.</p>

  To establish domain-adapted baselines, we propose DI-Chat, obtained by fine-tuning existing VLM backbones on disaster-specific instruction data using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art generic and remote-sensing VLMs reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, particularly in damage understanding and structured report generation. DI-Chat achieves significant improvements on damage-level and disaster-type classification as well as report generation quality, while building-function classification remains challenging for all evaluated models. DisasterInsight provides a unified benchmark for studying grounded multimodal reasoning in disaster imagery.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18532">From Cold Start to Active Learning: Embedding-Based Scan Selection for Medical Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Devon Levy, Bar Assayag, Laura Gaspar, Ilan Shimshoni, Bella Specktor-Fadida</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation annotations are critical for disease monitoring, yet manual labeling remains a major bottleneck due to the time and expertise required. Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm. Overall, the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in low-data regimes, improving segmentation accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixun Jiang, Yuzheng Wang, Junjie Zhou, Pandeng Li, Zhihang Liu, Chen-Wei Xie, Zhaoyu Chen, Yun Zheng, Wenqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce GenAgent, unifying visual understanding and generation through an agentic multimodal model. Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\%) and WISE (+14\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Ding, Mai Xu, Shengxi Li, Xin Deng, Xin Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: To expedite space exploration on Mars, it is indispensable to develop an efficient Martian image compression method for transmitting images through the constrained Mars-to-Earth communication channel. Although the existing learned compression methods have achieved promising results for natural images from earth, there remain two critical issues that hinder their effectiveness for Martian image compression: 1) They overlook the highly-limited computational resources on Mars; 2) They do not utilize the strong \textit{inter-image} similarities across Martian images to advance image compression performance. Motivated by our empirical analysis of the strong \textit{intra-} and \textit{inter-image} similarities from the perspective of texture, color, and semantics, we propose a reference-based Martian asymmetrical image compression (REMAC) approach, which shifts computational complexity from the encoder to the resource-rich decoder and simultaneously improves compression performance. To leverage \textit{inter-image} similarities, we propose a reference-guided entropy module and a ref-decoder that utilize useful information from reference images, reducing redundant operations at the encoder and achieving superior compression performance. To exploit \textit{intra-image} similarities, the ref-decoder adopts a deep, multi-scale architecture with enlarged receptive field size to model long-range spatial dependencies. Additionally, we develop a latent feature recycling mechanism to further alleviate the extreme computational constraints on Mars. Experimental results show that REMAC reduces encoder complexity by 43.51\% compared to the state-of-the-art method, while achieving a BD-PSNR gain of 0.2664 dB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Di Via, Vito Paolo Pastore, Francesca Odone, Si\^on Glyn-Jones, Irina Voiculescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many clinical screening decisions are based on angle measurements. In particular, FemoroAcetabular Impingement (FAI) screening relies on angles traditionally measured on X-rays. However, assessing the height and span of the impingement area requires also a 3D view through an MRI scan. The two modalities inform the surgeon on different aspects of the condition. In this work, we conduct a matched-cohort validation study (89 patients, paired MRI/X-ray) using standard heatmap regression architectures to assess cross-modality clinical equivalence. Seen that landmark detection has been proven effective on X-rays, we show that MRI also achieves equivalent localisation and diagnostic accuracy for cam-type impingement. Our method demonstrates clinical feasibility for FAI assessment in coronal views of 3D MRI volumes, opening the possibility for volumetric analysis through placing further landmarks. These results support integrating automated FAI assessment into routine MRI workflows. Code is released at https://github.com/Malga-Vision/Landmarks-Hip-Conditions</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingsong Xia, Siqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence has become a pivotal tool for enhancing medical diagnostics, particularly in medical image classification tasks such as detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays and breast cancer screening. However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16. Notably, our framework simultaneously attains 98.33% sensitivity and 98.33% specificity, achieving a balanced performance critical for clinical deployment. The proposed method validates the feasibility of integrating generative augmentation with quantum-enhanced modeling in real-world medical imaging tasks, offering a novel research pathway for developing highly reliable medical AI systems in small-sample, highly imbalanced, and high-risk diagnostic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Fang, Tianyu Li, Yanghong Lin, Shudong Zhou, Wei Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: As the important component of the Earth observation system, hyperspectral imaging satellites provide high-fidelity and enriched information for the formulation of related policies due to the powerful spectral measurement capabilities. However, the transmission speed of the satellite downlink has become a major bottleneck in certain applications, such as disaster monitoring and emergency mapping, which demand a fast response ability. We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making. To accommodate the resource constraints of satellite platforms, the proposed method adopts a lightweight, non-deep learning framework integrated with a few-shot learning strategy. Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix. Subsequently, a top-k pruned sparse graph is generated by directly computing pixel-level similarities. In the second stage, a closed-form solution derived from the sparse graph is employed to replace iterative computations. Furthermore, we developed a rank constraint-based graph clustering algorithm to determine the anchor labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwon Jang, Taekyung Ki, Jaehyeong Jo, Saining Xie, Jaehong Yoon, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern video generators still struggle with complex physical dynamics, often falling short of physical realism. Existing approaches address this using external verifiers or additional training on augmented data, which is computationally expensive and still limited in capturing fine-grained motion. In this work, we present self-refining video sampling, a simple method that uses a pre-trained video generator trained on large-scale datasets as its own self-refiner. By interpreting the generator as a denoising autoencoder, we enable iterative inner-loop refinement at inference time without any external verifier or additional training. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement strategy that selectively refines regions based on self-consistency, which prevents artifacts caused by over-refinement. Experiments on state-of-the-art video generators demonstrate significant improvements in motion coherence and physics alignment, achieving over 70\% human preference compared to the default sampler and guidance-based sampler.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Liu, Selena Ling, Alec Jacobson</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning-based adaptation is widely used to customize diffusion-based image generation, leading to large collections of community-created adapters that capture diverse subjects and styles. Adapters derived from the same base model can be merged with weights, enabling the synthesis of new visual results within a vast and continuous design space. To explore this space, current workflows rely on manual slider-based tuning, an approach that scales poorly and makes weight selection difficult, even when the candidate set is limited to 20-30 adapters. We propose GimmBO to support interactive exploration of adapter merging for image generation through Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO). Motivated by observations from real-world usage, including sparsity and constrained weight ranges, we introduce a two-stage BO backend that improves sampling efficiency and convergence in high-dimensional spaces. We evaluate our approach with simulated users and a user study, demonstrating improved convergence, high success rates, and consistent gains over BO and line-search baselines, and further show the flexibility of the framework through several extensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> KV Karthikeya, Ashok Kumar Das, Shantanu Pal, Vivekananda Bhat K, Arun Sekar Rajasekaran</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Graph Signal Processing with Dynamic Semantic Alignment (AGSP DSA) framework to perform robust multimodal data fusion over heterogeneous sources, including text, audio, and images. The requested approach uses a dual-graph construction to learn both intra-modal and inter-modal relations, spectral graph filtering to boost the informative signals, and effective node embedding with Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Semantic aware attention mechanism: each modality may dynamically contribute to the context with respect to contextual relevance. The experimental outcomes on three benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSEI, AVE, and MM-IMDB, show that AGSP-DSA performs as the state of the art. More precisely, it achieves 95.3% accuracy, 0.936 F1-score, and 0.924 mAP on CMU-MOSEI, improving MM-GNN by 2.6 percent in accuracy. It gets 93.4% accuracy and 0.911 F1-score on AVE and 91.8% accuracy and 0.886 F1-score on MM-IMDB, which demonstrate good generalization and robustness in the missing modality setting. These findings verify the efficiency of AGSP-DSA in promoting multimodal learning in sentiment analysis, event recognition and multimedia classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xia, Chang Liu, Tianqi Xiang, Zhigang Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery remains challenging due to limited feature representation and ineffective multi-scale fusion. Existing methods underutilize frequency information and rely on static convolutional operations, which constrain the capacity to obtain rich feature representations and hinder the effective exploitation of deep semantic features. To address these issues, we propose EFSI-DETR, a novel detection framework that integrates efficient semantic feature enhancement with dynamic frequency-spatial guidance. EFSI-DETR comprises two main components: (1) a Dynamic Frequency-Spatial Unified Synergy Network (DyFusNet) that jointly exploits frequency and spatial cues for robust multi-scale feature fusion, (2) an Efficient Semantic Feature Concentrator (ESFC) that enables deep semantic extraction with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, a Fine-grained Feature Retention (FFR) strategy is adopted to incorporate spatially rich shallow features during fusion to preserve fine-grained details, crucial for small object detection in UAV imagery. Extensive experiments on VisDrone and CODrone benchmarks demonstrate that our EFSI-DETR achieves the state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency, yielding improvement of \textbf{1.6}\% and \textbf{5.8}\% in AP and AP$_{s}$ on VisDrone, while obtaining \textbf{188} FPS inference speed on a single RTX 4090 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Quesada, Ghassan AlRegib</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful strategy for representation learning under limited annotation regimes, yet its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to many factors, especially the nature of the target task. In segmentation, existing pipelines are typically tuned to large, homogeneous regions, but their performance drops when objects are small, sparse, or locally irregular. In this work, we propose a scale-aware SSL adaptation that integrates small-window cropping into the augmentation pipeline, zooming in on fine-scale structures during pretraining. We evaluate this approach across two domains with markedly different data modalities: seismic imaging, where the goal is to segment sparse faults, and neuroimaging, where the task is to delineate small cellular structures. In both settings, our method yields consistent improvements over standard and state-of-the-art baselines under label constraints, improving accuracy by up to 13% for fault segmentation and 5% for cell delineation. In contrast, large-scale features such as seismic facies or tissue regions see little benefit, underscoring that the value of SSL depends critically on the scale of the target objects. Our findings highlight the need to align SSL design with object size and sparsity, offering a general principle for buil ding more effective representation learning pipelines across scientific imaging domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Yuzhou Chen, Shaogang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal image translation remains brittle and inefficient. Standard diffusion approaches often rely on a single, global linear transfer between domains. We find that this shortcut forces the sampler to traverse off-manifold, high-cost regions, inflating the correction burden and inviting semantic drift. We refer to this shared failure mode as fixed-schedule domain transfer. In this paper, we embed domain-shift dynamics directly into the generative process. Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency. Empirically, across translation tasks in medical imaging, remote sensing, and electroluminescence semantic mapping, our framework improves structural fidelity and semantic consistency while converging in fewer denoising steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve pedestrian images from large galleries using natural language descriptions. This task, essential for public safety applications, is hindered by cross-modal discrepancies and ambiguous user queries. We introduce CONQUER, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges by enhancing cross-modal alignment during training and adaptively refining queries at inference. During training, CONQUER employs multi-granularity encoding, complementary pair mining, and context-guided optimal matching based on Optimal Transport to learn robust embeddings. At inference, a plug-and-play query enhancement module refines vague or incomplete queries via anchor selection and attribute-driven enrichment, without requiring retraining of the backbone. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that CONQUER consistently outperforms strong baselines in both Rank-1 accuracy and mAP, yielding notable improvements in cross-domain and incomplete-query scenarios. These results highlight CONQUER as a practical and effective solution for real-world TBPS deployment. Source code is available at https://github.com/zqxie77/CONQUER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Shi, Melonie de Almeida, Daniela Ivanova, Nicolas Pugeault, Paul Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Talking Head Generation aims at synthesizing natural-looking talking videos from speech and a single portrait image. Previous 3D talking head generation methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based facial motion representation priors to animate talking motions, yet still produce inaccurate 3D avatar reconstructions, thus undermining the realism of generated animations. We introduce Splat-Portrait, a Gaussian-splatting-based method that addresses the challenges of 3D head reconstruction and lip motion synthesis. Our approach automatically learns to disentangle a single portrait image into a static 3D reconstruction represented as static Gaussian Splatting, and a predicted whole-image 2D background. It then generates natural lip motion conditioned on input audio, without any motion driven priors. Training is driven purely by 2D reconstruction and score-distillation losses, without 3D supervision nor landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Splat-Portrait exhibits superior performance on talking head generation and novel view synthesis, achieving better visual quality compared to previous works.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Liu, Jiawei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced visually compelling results, yet it remains unclear whether these models encode geographically equitable visual knowledge. In this work, we investigate the geo-equity and geographically grounded visual knowledge of text-to-video models through an attraction-centric evaluation. We introduce Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP), a systematic framework for assessing how faithfully models synthesize tourist attractions from diverse regions, and construct GEOATTRACTION-500, a benchmark of 500 globally distributed attractions spanning varied regions and popularity levels. GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve.</p>

Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data.

<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance.</p>

TelcoAI introduces section-aware chunking, structured query planning, metadata-guided retrieval, and multi-modal fusion of text and diagrams. Evaluated on multiple benchmarks-including expert-curated queries-our system achieves $87\%$ recall, $83\%$ claim recall, and $92\%$ faithfulness, representing a $16\%$ improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of agentic and multi-modal reasoning in technical document understanding, advancing practical solutions for real-world telecommunications research and engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. E. ElAlami, S. M. Khater, M. El. R. Rehan</p>
<p>Abstract: Technological developments have produced methods that can generate educational videos from input text or sound. Recently, the use of deep learning techniques for image and video generation has been widely explored, particularly in education. However, generating video content from conditional inputs such as text or speech remains a challenging area. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to the educational structure, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which develop frame-for-frame frameworks and are able to create full educational videos. The proposed system is structured into three main phases In the first phase, the input (either text or speech) is transcribed using speech recognition. In the second phase, key terms are extracted and relevant images are generated using advanced models such as CLIP and diffusion models to enhance visual quality and semantic alignment. In the final phase, the generated images are synthesized into a video format, integrated with either pre-recorded or synthesized sound, resulting in a fully interactive educational video. The proposed system is compared with other systems such as TGAN, MoCoGAN, and TGANS-C, achieving a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score of 28.75%, which indicates improved visual quality and better over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Zhang, Meimei Liu, Zhengwu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain organization is increasingly characterized through multiple imaging modalities, most notably structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC). Integrating these inherently distinct yet complementary data sources is essential for uncovering the cross-modal patterns that drive behavioral phenotypes. However, effective integration is hindered by the high dimensionality and non-linearity of connectome data, complex non-linear SC-FC coupling, and the challenge of disentangling shared information from modality-specific variations. To address these issues, we propose the Cross-Modal Joint-Individual Variational Network (CM-JIVNet), a unified probabilistic framework designed to learn factorized latent representations from paired SC-FC datasets. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention fusion module to capture non-linear cross-modal dependencies while isolating independent, modality-specific signals. Validated on Human Connectome Project Young Adult (HCP-YA) data, CM-JIVNet demonstrates superior performance in cross-modal reconstruction and behavioral trait prediction. By effectively disentangling joint and individual feature spaces, CM-JIVNet provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for large-scale multimodal brain analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite substantial efforts toward improving the moral alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear whether their ethical judgments are stable in realistic settings. This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daehwa Kim, Chris Harrison</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and explore a new multimodal input representation for vision-language models: acoustic field video. Unlike conventional video (RGB with stereo/mono audio), our video stream provides a spatially grounded visualization of sound intensity across a scene, offering a new and powerful dimension of perceptual understanding. Our real-time pipeline uses low-cost beamforming microphone arrays that are already common in smart speakers and increasingly present in robotics and XR headsets, yet this sensing capability remains unutilized for scene understanding. To assess the value of spatial acoustic information, we constructed an evaluation set of 402 question-answer scenes, comparing a state-of-the-art VLM given conventional video with and without paired acoustic field video. Results show a clear and consistent improvement when incorporating spatial acoustic data; the VLM we test improves from 38.3% correct to 67.4%. Our findings highlight that many everyday scene understanding tasks remain underconstrained when relying solely on visual and audio input, and that acoustic field data provides a promising and practical direction for multimodal reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panpan Chen, Seonyeong Park, Gangwon Jeong, Refik Mert Cam, Umberto Villa, Mark A. Anastasio</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image reconstruction methods for photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) have developed rapidly in recent years. However, most existing methods have not employed standardized datasets, and their evaluations rely on traditional image quality (IQ) metrics that may lack clinical relevance. The absence of a standardized framework for clinically meaningful IQ assessment hinders fair comparison and raises concerns about the reproducibility and reliability of reported advancements in PACT. A benchmarking framework is proposed that provides open-source, anatomically plausible synthetic datasets and evaluation strategies for DL-based acoustic inversion methods in PACT. The datasets each include over 11,000 two-dimensional (2D) stochastic breast objects with clinically relevant lesions and paired measurements at varying modeling complexity. The evaluation strategies incorporate both traditional and task-based IQ measures to assess fidelity and clinical utility. A preliminary benchmarking study is conducted to demonstrate the framework's utility by comparing DL-based and physics-based reconstruction methods. The benchmarking study demonstrated that the proposed framework enabled comprehensive, quantitative comparisons of reconstruction performance and revealed important limitations in certain DL-based methods. Although they performed well according to traditional IQ measures, they often failed to accurately recover lesions. This highlights the inadequacy of traditional metrics and motivates the need for task-based assessments. The proposed benchmarking framework enables systematic comparisons of DL-based acoustic inversion methods for 2D PACT. By integrating clinically relevant synthetic datasets with rigorous evaluation protocols, it enables reproducible, objective assessments and facilitates method development and system optimization in PACT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonu Kumar, Lavanya Vinnakota, Mukul Lokhande, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma, Adam Teman</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for edge-AI systems requires arithmetic units that balance numerical precision, energy efficiency, and compact hardware while supporting diverse formats. Posit arithmetic offers advantages over floating- and fixed-point representations through its tapered precision, wide dynamic range, and improved numerical robustness. This work presents SPADE, a unified multi-precision SIMD Posit-based multiplyaccumulate (MAC) architecture supporting Posit (8,0), Posit (16,1), and Posit (32,2) within a single framework. Unlike prior single-precision or floating/fixed-point SIMD MACs, SPADE introduces a regime-aware, lane-fused SIMD Posit datapath that hierarchically reuses Posit-specific submodules (LOD, complementor, shifter, and multiplier) across 8/16/32-bit precisions without datapath replication. FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-7 shows 45.13% LUT and 80% slice reduction for Posit (8,0), and up to 28.44% and 17.47% improvement for Posit (16,1) and Posit (32,2) over prior work, with only 6.9% LUT and 14.9% register overhead for multi-precision support. ASIC results across TSMC nodes achieve 1.38 GHz at 6.1 mW (28 nm). Evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and alphabet datasets confirms competitive inference accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurent Caraffa</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning relies on a collection of empirically successful but theoretically heterogeneous regularization techniques, such as weight decay, dropout, and exponential moving averages. At the same time, the rapidly increasing energetic cost of training large models raises the question of whether learning algorithms approach any fundamental efficiency bound. In this work, we propose a unifying theoretical framework connecting thermodynamic optimality, information geometry, and regularization.
  Under three explicit assumptions -- (A1) that optimality requires an intrinsic, parametrization-invariant measure of information, (A2) that belief states are modeled by maximum-entropy distributions under known constraints, and (A3) that optimal processes are quasi-static -- we prove a conditional optimality theorem. Specifically, the Fisher--Rao metric is the unique admissible geometry on belief space, and thermodynamically optimal regularization corresponds to minimizing squared Fisher--Rao distance to a reference state.
  We derive the induced geometries for Gaussian and circular belief models, yielding hyperbolic and von Mises manifolds, respectively, and show that classical regularization schemes are structurally incapable of guaranteeing thermodynamic optimality. We introduce a notion of thermodynamic efficiency of learning and propose experimentally testable predictions. This work provides a principled geometric and thermodynamic foundation for regularization in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyijie Wang, Siteng Ma, Gu\'enol\'e Silvestre, Kathleen M. Curran</p>
<p>Abstract: Fetal ultrasound (US) data is often limited due to privacy and regulatory restrictions, posing challenges for training deep learning (DL) models. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) is commonly used for fetal US image analysis, existing SSL methods typically rely on random limited selection, which can lead to suboptimal model performance by overfitting to homogeneous labeled data. To address this, we propose a two-stage Active Learning (AL) sampler, Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity (EGAD), for fetal head segmentation. Our method first selects the most uncertain samples using predictive entropy, and then refines the final selection using the agreement-diversity score combining cosine similarity and mutual information. Additionally, our SSL framework employs a consistency learning strategy with feature downsampling to further enhance segmentation performance. In experiments, SSL-EGAD achieves an average Dice score of 94.57\% and 96.32\% on two public datasets for fetal head segmentation, using 5\% and 10\% labeled data for training, respectively. Our method outperforms current SSL models and showcases consistent robustness across diverse pregnancy stage data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Bajpai, Akshat Bhandari, Akshay Nambi, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Small-to-Medium sized Language Models (MSLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating visual and textual information but still face significant limitations in visual comprehension and mathematical reasoning, particularly in geometric problems with diverse levels of visual infusion. Current models struggle to accurately decompose intricate visual inputs and connect perception with structured reasoning, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning. To this end, we introduce MATHVERSE-PLUS, a novel dataset containing structured visual interpretations and step-by-step reasoning paths for vision-intensive mathematical problems. SpatialMath significantly outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving up to 10 percentage points improvement over supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation in vision-intensive settings. Robustness analysis reveals that enhanced spatial representations directly improve reasoning accuracy, reinforcing the need for structured perception-to-reasoning pipelines in MSLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Venkata Surya Sai Mogilisetti, Partha Pratim Das, Rassel Raihan, Shiyao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents ME-WARD (Multimodal Ergonomic Workplace Assessment and Risk from Data), a novel system for ergonomic assessment and musculoskeletal risk evaluation that implements the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method. ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Internet audio-visual clips convey meaning through time-varying sound and motion, which extend beyond what text alone can represent. To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content. These findings highlight a key gap in human-aligned multimodal intelligence and call for models that can perceive contextually and culturally beyond the surface of what they hear and see.

<p>Abstract: Bangla, one of the most widely spoken languages, remains underrepresented in state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) research, particularly under noisy and speaker-diverse conditions. This paper presents BanglaRobustNet, a hybrid denoising-attention framework built on Wav2Vec-BERT, designed to address these challenges. The architecture integrates a diffusion-based denoising module to suppress environmental noise while preserving Bangla-specific phonetic cues, and a contextual cross-attention module that conditions recognition on speaker embeddings for robustness across gender, age, and dialects. Trained end-to-end with a composite objective combining CTC loss, phonetic consistency, and speaker alignment, BanglaRobustNet achieves substantial reductions in word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) compared to Wav2Vec-BERT and Whisper baselines. Evaluations on Mozilla Common Voice Bangla and augmented noisy speech confirm the effectiveness of our approach, establishing BanglaRobustNet as a robust ASR system tailored to low-resource, noise-prone linguistic settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Images often communicate more than they literally depict: a set of tools can suggest an occupation and a cultural artifact can suggest a tradition. This kind of indirect visual reference, known as visual metonymy, invites viewers to recover a target concept via associated cues rather than explicit depiction. In this work, we present the first computational investigation of visual metonymy. We introduce a novel pipeline grounded in semiotic theory that leverages large language models and text-to-image models to generate metonymic visual representations. Using this framework, we construct ViMET, the first visual metonymy dataset comprising 2,000 multiple-choice questions to evaluate the cognitive reasoning abilities in multimodal language models. Experimental results on our dataset reveal a significant gap between human performance (86.9%) and state-of-the-art vision-language models (65.9%), highlighting limitations in machines' ability to interpret indirect visual references.

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), aiming to learn transferable neural representations from large-scale heterogeneous recordings. Despite rapid progresses, there lacks fair and comprehensive comparisons of existing EEG foundation models, due to inconsistent pre-training objectives, preprocessing choices, and downstream evaluation protocols. This paper fills this gap. We first review 50 representative models and organize their design choices into a unified taxonomic framework including data standardization, model architectures, and self-supervised pre-training strategies. We then evaluate 12 open-source foundation models and competitive specialist baselines across 13 EEG datasets spanning nine BCI paradigms. Emphasizing real-world deployments, we consider both cross-subject generalization under a leave-one-subject-out protocol and rapid calibration under a within-subject few-shot setting. We further compare full-parameter fine-tuning with linear probing to assess the transferability of pre-trained representations, and examine the relationship between model scale and downstream performance. Our results indicate that: 1) linear probing is frequently insufficient; 2) specialist models trained from scratch remain competitive across many tasks; and, 3) larger foundation models do not necessarily yield better generalization performance under current data regimes and training practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer a compelling paradigm for natural language generation, leveraging parallel decoding and bidirectional attention to achieve superior global coherence compared to autoregressive models. While recent works have accelerated inference via KV cache reuse or heuristic decoding, they overlook the intrinsic inefficiencies within the block-wise diffusion process. Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens. Extensive experiments show that Streaming-dLLM achieves up to 68.2X speedup while maintaining generation quality, highlighting its effectiveness in diffusion decoding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurent Caraffa</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a perspective in which learning is an intrinsically dissipative process. Forgetting and regularization are not heuristic add-ons but structural requirements for adaptive systems. Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.
  A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, showing that Fisher-Rao regularization measuring change via information divergence rather than Euclidean distance is the unique thermodynamically optimal regularization strategy, achieving minimal dissipation. Euclidean regularization is shown to be structurally suboptimal. The framework unifies existing methods (Ridge, SIGReg, EMA, SAC) as special cases of a single governing equation.
  Within this view, overfitting corresponds to over-crystallization, while catastrophic forgetting reflects insufficient dissipation control. The framework distinguishes BEDS-crystallizable problems, where beliefs converge to stable equilibria, from BEDS-maintainable problems, which require continual adaptation. It extends naturally to continual and multi-agent systems, where viability, stability under adaptation and finite resources replaces asymptotic optimality as the primary criterion. Overall, this work reframes learning as maintaining viable belief states under dissipation constraints, providing a principled lens on forgetting, regularization, and stability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning networks excel at classification, yet identifying minimal architectures that reliably solve a task remains challenging. We present a computational methodology for systematically exploring and analyzing the relationships among convergence, pruning, and quantization. The workflow first performs a structured design sweep across a large set of architectures, then evaluates convergence behavior, pruning sensitivity, and quantization robustness on representative models. Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Afane, Quanjiang Long, Haoting Shen, Ying Mao, Junaid Farooq, Ying Wang, Juntao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current quantum neural networks suffer from extreme sensitivity to both adversarial perturbations and hardware noise, creating a significant barrier to real-world deployment. Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods. Under various attack scenarios, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), and Momentum Iterative Method (MIM), and under realistic quantum noise conditions, our hybrid framework maintains superior performance. Testing on actual quantum hardware confirms the practical viability of discovered architectures. These results demonstrate that strategic classical preprocessing combined with differentiable quantum architecture optimization can significantly enhance quantum neural network robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeonggyeol Choi, Woojin Oh, Jongwoo Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Dexterous hand manipulation increasingly relies on large-scale motion datasets with precise hand-object trajectory data. However, existing resources such as DexYCB and HO3D are primarily optimized for visual alignment but often yield physically implausible interactions when replayed in physics simulators, including penetration, missed contact, and unstable grasps.
  We propose a simulation-in-the-loop refinement framework that converts these visually aligned trajectories into physically executable ones. Our core contribution is to formulate this as a tractable black-box optimization problem. We parameterize the hand's motion using a low-dimensional, spline-based representation built on sparse temporal keyframes. This allows us to use a powerful gradient-free optimizer, CMA-ES, to treat the high-fidelity physics engine as a black-box objective function. Our method finds motions that simultaneously maximize physical success (e.g., stable grasp and lift) while minimizing deviation from the original human demonstration.
  Compared to MANIPTRANS-recent transfer pipelines, our approach achieves lower hand and object pose errors during replay and more accurately recovers hand-object physical interactions. Our approach provides a general and scalable method for converting visual demonstrations into physically valid trajectories, enabling the generation of high-fidelity data crucial for robust policy learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Che-Yung Shen, Xilin Yang, Yuzhu Li, Leon Lenk, Aydogan Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is critical for breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection; yet, most existing digital HER2 scoring methods rely on bulky and expensive optical systems. Here, we present a compact and cost-effective lensfree holography platform integrated with deep learning for automated HER2 scoring of immunohistochemically stained breast tissue sections. The system captures lensfree diffraction patterns of stained HER2 tissue sections under RGB laser illumination and acquires complex field information over a sample area of ~1,250 mm^2 at an effective throughput of ~84 mm^2 per minute. To enhance diagnostic reliability, we incorporated an uncertainty quantification strategy based on Bayesian Monte Carlo dropout, which provides autonomous uncertainty estimates for each prediction and supports reliable, robust HER2 scoring, with an overall correction rate of 30.4%. Using a blinded test set of 412 unique tissue samples, our approach achieved a testing accuracy of 84.9% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) HER2 classification and 94.8% for binary (0/1+ vs. 2+/3+) HER2 scoring with uncertainty quantification. Overall, this lensfree holography approach provides a practical pathway toward portable, high-throughput, and cost-effective HER2 scoring, particularly suited for resource-limited settings, where traditional digital pathology infrastructure is unavailable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tafazzul Nadeem, Bhavik Shangari, Manish Rai, Gagan Raj Gupta, Ashutosh Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Professionals working in technical domain typically hand-draw (on whiteboard, paper, etc.) technical diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, block diagrams, etc.) during discussions; however, if they want to edit these later, it needs to be drawn from scratch. Modern day VLMs have made tremendous progress in image understanding but they struggle when it comes to understanding technical diagrams. One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models. On real-world images, human evaluation reveals that we achieve minimum compilation errors across all baselines in 7 out of 8 diagram types and improve the average F1 score of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 6.97x.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixian Zhao, Wenjie Tian, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Lei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a "perceive-then-reason" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyang Li, Thomas Graave, Bj\"orn M\"oller, Zehang Wu, Matthias Franz, Tim Fingscheidt</p>
<p>Abstract: In audiovisual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) systems, information fusion of visual features in a pre-trained ASR has been proven as a promising method to improve noise robustness. In this work, based on the prominent Whisper ASR, first, we propose a simple and effective visual fusion method -- use of visual features both in encoder and decoder (dual-use) -- to learn the audiovisual interactions in the encoder and to weigh modalities in the decoder. Second, we compare visual fusion methods in Whisper models of various sizes. Our proposed dual-use method shows consistent noise robustness improvement, e.g., a 35% relative improvement (WER: 4.41% vs. 6.83%) based on Whisper small, and a 57% relative improvement (WER: 4.07% vs. 9.53%) based on Whisper medium, compared to typical reference middle fusion in babble noise with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0dB. Third, we conduct ablation studies examining the impact of various module designs and fusion options. Fine-tuned on 1929 hours of audiovisual data, our dual-use method using Whisper medium achieves 4.08% (MUSAN babble noise) and 4.43% (NoiseX babble noise) average WER across various SNRs, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art in noisy conditions on the LRS3 AV-ASR benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhui Liu, Can Wang, Lei Liu, Zhenghao Chen, Wei Jiang, Wei Wang, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) reconstruction enables photorealistic and interactive 3D scene visualization; however, real-time streaming is often bottlenecked by sparse-view inputs, prohibitive training costs, and bandwidth constraints. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced FVV due to its superior rendering speed, Streaming Free-Viewpoint Video (SFVV) introduces additional demands for rapid optimization, high-fidelity reconstruction under sparse constraints, and minimal storage footprints. To bridge this gap, we propose StreamLoD-GS, an LoD-based Gaussian Splatting framework designed specifically for SFVV. Our approach integrates three core innovations: 1) an Anchor- and Octree-based LoD-structured 3DGS with a hierarchical Gaussian dropout technique to ensure efficient and stable optimization while maintaining high-quality rendering; 2) a GMM-based motion partitioning mechanism that separates dynamic and static content, refining dynamic regions while preserving background stability; and 3) a quantized residual refinement framework that significantly reduces storage requirements without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StreamLoD-GS achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, efficiency, and storage.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of AI agents introduces complex safety and security challenges arising from autonomous tool use and environmental interactions. Current guardrail models lack agentic risk awareness and transparency in risk diagnosis. To introduce an agentic guardrail that covers complex and numerous risky behaviors, we first propose a unified three-dimensional taxonomy that orthogonally categorizes agentic risks by their source (where), failure mode (how), and consequence (what). Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AgentDoG achieves state-of-the-art performance in agentic safety moderation in diverse and complex interactive scenarios. All models and datasets are openly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Grassucci, Giordano Cicchetti, Emanuele Frasca, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has been recognized as the \textit{de facto} method for learning a shared latent space across multiple modalities, placing similar representations close to each other and moving them away from dissimilar ones. Although CLIP-based losses effectively align modalities at the semantic level, the resulting latent spaces often remain only partially shared, revealing a structural mismatch known as the modality gap. While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering). To support this claim, we introduce a novel method designed to consistently reduce this discrepancy in two-modal settings, with a straightforward extension to the general $n$-modal case. Through our extensive evaluation, we demonstrate our novel insight: while reducing the gap provides only marginal or inconsistent improvements in traditional instance-wise tasks, it significantly enhances group-wise tasks. These findings may reshape our understanding of the modality gap, highlighting its key role in improving performance on tasks requiring semantic grouping.</p>

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances DA conversion speed but also significantly boosts classification accuracy. This positions our method as superior to current state-of-the-art techniques, making it a preferable choice for complex domain adaptation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Haoyu Sun, Jiawei Gu, Linjie Li, Luxin Xu, Ranjay Krishna, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.</p>

<p>Abstract: Latent-space optimization methods for counterfactual explanations - framed as minimal semantic perturbations that change model predictions - inherit the ambiguity of Wachter et al.'s objective: the choice of distance metric dictates whether perturbations are meaningful or adversarial. Existing approaches adopt flat or misaligned geometries, leading to off-manifold artifacts, semantic drift, or adversarial collapse. We introduce Perceptual Counterfactual Geodesics (PCG), a method that constructs counterfactuals by tracing geodesics under a perceptually Riemannian metric induced from robust vision features. This geometry aligns with human perception and penalizes brittle directions, enabling smooth, on-manifold, semantically valid transitions. Experiments on three vision datasets show that PCG outperforms baselines and reveals failure modes hidden under standard metrics.</p>

Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second per GPU with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Hagnberger, Mathias Niepert</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as more efficient alternatives to numerical solvers for physical simulations over complex geometries, such as car bodies. Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwen Zhang, Yating Tian, Yuxiang Zhang, Mengcheng Li, Liang An, Zhenan Sun, Yebin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PyMAF-X, a regression-based approach to recovering parametric full-body models from monocular images. This task is very challenging since minor parametric deviation may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated mesh and the input image. Moreover, when integrating part-specific estimations into the full-body model, existing solutions tend to either degrade the alignment or produce unnatural wrist poses. To address these issues, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop in our regression network for well-aligned human mesh recovery and extend it as PyMAF-X for the recovery of expressive full-body models. The core idea of PyMAF is to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status. Specifically, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned evidence will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To enhance the alignment perception, an auxiliary dense supervision is employed to provide mesh-image correspondence guidance while spatial alignment attention is introduced to enable the awareness of the global contexts for our network. When extending PyMAF for full-body mesh recovery, an adaptive integration strategy is proposed in PyMAF-X to produce natural wrist poses while maintaining the well-aligned performance of the part-specific estimations. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets for body, hand, face, and full-body mesh recovery, where PyMAF and PyMAF-X effectively improve the mesh-image alignment and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

Existing learning-based methods typically add pose-dependent deformations upon a minimally-clothed mesh template or a learned implicit template, which have limitations in capturing details or hinder end-to-end learning. In this paper, we revisit point-based solutions and propose to decompose explicit garment-related templates and then add pose-dependent wrinkles to them. In this way, the clothing deformations are disentangled such that the pose-dependent wrinkles can be better learned and applied to unseen poses. Additionally, to tackle the seam artifact issues in recent state-of-the-art point-based methods, we propose to learn point features on a body surface, which establishes a continuous and compact feature space to capture the fine-grained and pose-dependent clothing geometry. To facilitate the research in this field, we also introduce a high-quality scan dataset of humans in real-world clothing. Our approach is validated on two existing datasets and our newly introduced dataset, showing better clothing deformation results in unseen poses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Guo, Haoyu Zhang, Yongkang Wong, Liqiang Nie, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a versatile language-image model is computationally prohibitive under a limited computing budget. This paper delves into the \emph{efficient language-image pre-training}, an area that has received relatively little attention despite its importance in reducing computational cost and footprint. To that end, we propose a vision token pruning and merging method ELIP, to remove less influential tokens based on the supervision of language outputs. Our method is designed with several strengths, such as being computation-efficient, memory-efficient, and trainable-parameter-free, and is distinguished from previous vision-only token pruning approaches by its alignment with task objectives. We implement this method in a progressively pruning manner using several sequential blocks. To evaluate its generalization performance, we apply ELIP to three commonly used language-image pre-training models and utilize public image-caption pairs with 4M images for pre-training. Our experiments demonstrate that with the removal of ~30$\%$ vision tokens across 12 ViT layers, ELIP maintains significantly comparable performance with baselines ($\sim$0.32 accuracy drop on average) over various downstream tasks including cross-modal retrieval, VQA, image captioning, \emph{etc}. In addition, the spared GPU resources by our ELIP allow us to scale up with larger batch sizes, thereby accelerating model pre-training and even sometimes enhancing downstream model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael R. H. Vorndran, Bernhard F. Roeck</p>
<p>Abstract: A primary challenge in semi-supervised learning (SSL) for segmentation is the confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, which destabilizes training and degrades performance. We propose Inconsistency Masks (IM), a framework that reframes model disagreement not as noise to be averaged away, but as a valuable signal for identifying uncertainty. IM leverages an ensemble of teacher models to generate a mask that explicitly delineates regions where predictions diverge. By filtering these inconsistent areas from input-pseudo-label pairs, our method effectively mitigates the cycle of error propagation common in both continuous and iterative self-training paradigms. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes benchmark demonstrate IM's effectiveness as a general enhancement framework: when paired with leading approaches like iMAS, U$^2$PL, and UniMatch, our method consistently boosts accuracy, achieving superior benchmarks across ResNet-50 and DINOv2 backbones, and even improving distilled architectures like SegKC. Furthermore, the method's robustness is confirmed in resource-constrained scenarios where pre-trained weights are unavailable. On three additional diverse datasets from medical and underwater domains trained entirely from scratch, IM significantly outperforms standard SSL baselines. Notably, the IM framework is dataset-agnostic, seamlessly handling binary, multi-class, and complex multi-label tasks by operating on discretized predictions. By prioritizing training stability, IM offers a generalizable and robust solution for semi-supervised segmentation, particularly in specialized areas lacking large-scale pre-training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Kang, Fung Fung Ting, Shier Nee Saw, Rapha\"el C. -W. Phan, Zongyuan Ge, Chee-Ming Ting</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing brain tumor segmentation methods usually utilize multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities in brain tumor images for segmentation, which can achieve better segmentation performance. However, in clinical applications, some modalities are often missing due to resource constraints, resulting in significant performance degradation for methods that rely on complete modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal feature distillation with Mamba-Transformer hybrid network (MMTSeg) for accurate brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. We first employ a Multimodal Feature Distillation (MFD) module to distill feature-level multimodal knowledge into different unimodalities to extract complete modality information. We further develop an Unimodal Feature Enhancement (UFE) module to model the semantic relationship between global and local information. Finally, we built a Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module to explicitly align the global correlations across modalities, even when some modalities are missing. Complementary features within and across modalities are refined by the Mamba-Transformer hybrid architectures in both the UFE and CMF modules, dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and global semantic information for complex spatial contexts. A boundary-wise loss function is employed as the segmentation loss of the proposed MMTSeg to minimize boundary discrepancies for a distance-based metric. Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of the proposed feature enhancement and fusion modules in the proposed network and the Transformer with Mamba block for improving the performance of brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMTSeg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods when modalities are missing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sacha Jungerman, Aryan Garg, Mohit Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural radiance fields, or NeRFs, have become the de facto approach for high-quality view synthesis from a collection of images captured from multiple viewpoints. However, many issues remain when capturing images in-the-wild under challenging conditions, such as low light, high dynamic range, or rapid motion leading to smeared reconstructions with noticeable artifacts. In this work, we introduce quanta radiance fields, a novel class of neural radiance fields that are trained at the granularity of individual photons using single-photon cameras (SPCs). We develop theory and practical computational techniques for building radiance fields and estimating dense camera poses from unconventional, stochastic, and high-speed binary frame sequences captured by SPCs. We demonstrate, both via simulations and a SPC hardware prototype, high-fidelity reconstructions under high-speed motion, in low light, and for extreme dynamic range settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a framework for monocular 6D pose estimation of surgical instruments in open surgery, addressing challenges such as object articulations, specularity, occlusions, and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation. The proposed approach consists of three main components: $(1)$ synthetic data generation pipeline that incorporates 3D scanning of surgical tools with articulation rigging and physically-based rendering; $(2)$ a tailored pose estimation framework combining tool detection with pose and articulation estimation; and $(3)$ a training strategy on synthetic and real unannotated video data, employing domain adaptation with automatically generated pseudo-labels. Evaluations conducted on real data of open surgery demonstrate the good performance and real-world applicability of the proposed framework, highlighting its potential for integration into medical augmented reality and robotic systems. The approach eliminates the need for extensive manual annotation of real surgical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eashan Adhikarla, Kai Zhang, Rosaura G. VidalMata, Manjushree Aithal, Nikhil Ambha Madhusudhana, John Nicholson, Lichao Sun, Brian D. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent strides made by AI in image processing, the issue of mixed exposure, pivotal in many real-world scenarios like surveillance and photography, remains inadequately addressed. Traditional image enhancement techniques and current transformer models are limited with primary focus on either overexposure or underexposure. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified-Exposure Guided Transformer (Unified-EGformer). Our proposed solution is built upon advanced transformer architectures, equipped with local pixel-level refinement and global refinement blocks for color correction and image-wide adjustments. We employ a guided attention mechanism to precisely identify exposure-compromised regions, ensuring its adaptability across various real-world conditions. U-EGformer, with a lightweight design featuring a memory footprint (peak memory) of only $\sim$1134 MB (0.1 Million parameters) and an inference time of 95 ms (9.61x faster than the average), is a viable choice for real-time applications such as surveillance and autonomous navigation. Additionally, our model is highly generalizable, requiring minimal fine-tuning to handle multiple tasks and datasets with a single architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eashan Adhikarla, Kai Zhang, Gong Chen, John Nicholson, Brian D. Davison</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a persistent challenge in computer vision, where state-of-the-art models are often hampered by hardware constraints and computational inefficiency, particularly at high resolutions. While foundational architectures like transformers and diffusion models have advanced the field, their computational complexity limits their deployment on edge devices. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates a frequency-aware state-space model within a modified U-Net. ExpoMamba is designed to address mixed-exposure challenges by decoupling the modeling of amplitude (intensity) and phase (structure) in the frequency domain. This allows for targeted enhancement, making it highly effective for real-time applications, including downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ExpoMamba is up to 2-3x faster than competing models and achieves a 6.8\% PSNR improvement, establishing a new state-of-the-art in efficient, high-quality low-light enhancement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuting Hong, Yongkang Wu, Hui Xiao, Huazheng Hao, Xiaojie Qiu, Baochen Yao, Chengbin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: In fine-grained road scene understanding, semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in enabling vehicles to perceive and comprehend their surroundings. By assigning a specific class label to each pixel in an image, it allows for precise identification and localization of detailed road features, which is vital for high-quality scene understanding and downstream perception tasks. A key challenge in this domain lies in improving the recognition performance of minority classes while mitigating the dominance of majority classes, which is essential for achieving balanced and robust overall performance. However, traditional semi-supervised learning methods often train models overlooking the imbalance between classes. To address this issue, firstly, we propose a general training module that learns from all the pseudo-labels without a conventional filtering strategy. Secondly, we propose a professional training module to learn specifically from reliable minority-class pseudo-labels identified by a novel mismatch score metric. The two modules are crossly supervised by each other so that it reduces model coupling which is essential for semi-supervised learning. During contrastive learning, to avoid the dominance of the majority classes in the feature space, we propose a strategy to assign evenly distributed anchors for different classes in the feature space. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks show that our method surpasses traditional approaches in recognizing tail classes.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce ProLIP, a simple and architecture-agnostic method for adapting contrastively pretrained vision-language models, such as CLIP, to few-shot classification. ProLIP fine-tunes the vision encoder's projection matrix with Frobenius norm regularization on its deviation from the pretrained weights. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 few-shot classification benchmarks under both ``few-shot validation'' and ``validation-free'' settings. Moreover, by rethinking the non-linear CLIP-Adapter through ProLIP's lens, we design a Regularized Linear Adapter (RLA) that performs better, requires no hyperparameter tuning, is less sensitive to learning rate values, and offers an alternative to ProLIP in black-box scenarios where model weights are inaccessible. Beyond few-shot classification, ProLIP excels in cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, base-to-new class generalization, and test-time adaptation--where it outperforms prompt tuning while being an order of magnitude faster to train.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Li, Weiwei Guo, Xue Yang, Ning Liao, Shaofeng Zhang, Yi Yu, Wenxian Yu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, aerial object detection has been increasingly pivotal in various earth observation applications. However, current algorithms are limited to detecting a set of pre-defined object categories, demanding sufficient annotated training samples, and fail to detect novel object categories. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the aerial object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD), which can detect objects beyond training categories without costly collecting new labeled data. We propose CastDet, a CLIP-activated student-teacher detection framework that serves as the first OVAD detector specifically designed for the challenging aerial scenario, where objects often exhibit weak appearance features and arbitrary orientations. Our framework integrates a robust localization teacher along with several box selection strategies to generate high-quality proposals for novel objects. Additionally, the RemoteCLIP model is adopted as an omniscient teacher, which provides rich knowledge to enhance classification capabilities for novel categories. A dynamic label queue is devised to maintain high-quality pseudo-labels during training. By doing so, the proposed CastDet boosts not only novel object proposals but also classification. Furthermore, we extend our approach from horizontal OVAD to oriented OVAD with tailored algorithm designs to effectively manage bounding box representation and pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments for both tasks on multiple existing aerial object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhou, Qingshan Xu, Jiequan Cui, Junbao Zhou, Jing Zhang, Richang Hong, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large efforts have been made to design efficient linear-complexity visual Transformers. However, current linear attention models are generally unsuitable to be deployed in resource-constrained mobile devices, due to suffering from either few efficiency gains or significant accuracy drops. In this paper, we propose a new de\textbf{C}oupled du\textbf{A}l-interactive linea\textbf{R} att\textbf{E}ntion (CARE) mechanism, revealing that features' decoupling and interaction can fully unleash the power of linear attention. We first propose an asymmetrical feature decoupling strategy that asymmetrically decouples the learning process for local inductive bias and long-range dependencies, thereby preserving sufficient local and global information while effectively enhancing the efficiency of models. Then, a dynamic memory unit is employed to maintain critical information along the network pipeline. Moreover, we design a dual interaction module to effectively facilitate interaction between local inductive bias and long-range information as well as among features at different layers. By adopting a decoupled learning way and fully exploiting complementarity across features, our method can achieve both high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., achieving $78.4/82.1\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImagegNet-1K at the cost of only $0.7/1.9$ GMACs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Wang, Hang Ye, Fangzhou Hong, Xue Yang, Jianfu Zhang, Yizhou Wang, Ziwei Liu, Liang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a single in-the-wild human photo, it remains a challenging task to reconstruct a high-fidelity 3D human model. Existing methods face difficulties including a) the varying body proportions captured by in-the-wild human images; b) diverse personal belongings within the shot; and c) ambiguities in human postures and inconsistency in human textures. In addition, the scarcity of high-quality human data intensifies the challenge. To address these problems, we propose a Generalizable image-to-3D huMAN reconstruction framework, dubbed GeneMAN, building upon a comprehensive multi-source collection of high-quality human data, including 3D scans, multi-view videos, single photos, and our generated synthetic human data. GeneMAN encompasses three key modules. 1) Without relying on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), GeneMAN first trains a human-specific text-to-image diffusion model and a view-conditioned diffusion model, serving as GeneMAN 2D human prior and 3D human prior for reconstruction, respectively. 2) With the help of the pretrained human prior models, the Geometry Initialization-&-Sculpting pipeline is leveraged to recover high-quality 3D human geometry given a single image. 3) To achieve high-fidelity 3D human textures, GeneMAN employs the Multi-Space Texture Refinement pipeline, consecutively refining textures in the latent and the pixel spaces. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GeneMAN could generate high-quality 3D human models from a single image input, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. Notably, GeneMAN could reveal much better generalizability in dealing with in-the-wild images, often yielding high-quality 3D human models in natural poses with common items, regardless of the body proportions in the input images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yimu Wang, Evelien Riddell, Adrian Chow, Sean Sedwards, Krzysztof Czarnecki</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection typically rely on similarity scores between input images and in-distribution (ID) text prototypes. However, the modality gap between image and text often results in high false positive rates, as OOD samples can exhibit high similarity to ID text prototypes. To mitigate the impact of this modality gap, we propose incorporating ID image prototypes along with ID text prototypes. We present theoretical analysis and empirical evidence indicating that this approach enhances VLM-based OOD detection performance without any additional training. To further reduce the gap between image and text, we introduce a novel few-shot tuning framework, SUPREME, comprising biased prompts generation (BPG) and image-text consistency (ITC) modules. BPG enhances image-text fusion and improves generalization by conditioning ID text prototypes on the Gaussian-based estimated image domain bias; ITC reduces the modality gap by minimizing intra- and inter-modal distances. Moreover, inspired by our theoretical and empirical findings, we introduce a novel OOD score $S_{\textit{GMP}}$, leveraging uni- and cross-modal similarities. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate that SUPREME consistently outperforms existing VLM-based OOD detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mennatullah Siam</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. The current trend is to train MLLMs with pixel-level grounding supervision in terms of masks on large-scale labelled data and specialized decoders for the segmentation task. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision-centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering (VQA). Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such pixel-level supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks with paired evaluation for both VQA and grounding. We demonstrate that simple baselines that are not unified achieve performance that matches or surpasses some of the pixel-level MLLMs. Our paired benchmarks and evaluation enable additional analysis on the reasons for failure with respect to VQA and/or grounding. Furthermore, we propose a prompt sensitivity analysis on both the language and visual prompts tailored for the grounding task. More importantly, we study the research question of ``When does grounding emerge in MLLMs with respect to the output tokens?'' We propose an interpretability tool that can be plugged into any MLLM to study the aforementioned question. We show that grounding does not necessarily coincide with the exact referring expression in the output, but can coincide with the object parts, its location, appearance, context or state.

<p>Abstract: Achieving health equity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires diagnostic models that maintain reliability across diverse populations. However, breast cancer screening systems frequently suffer from domain overfitting, degrading significantly when deployed to varying demographics. While Invariant Learning algorithms aim to mitigate this by suppressing site-specific correlations, their efficacy in medical imaging remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluates domain generalization techniques for mammography.
  We constructed a multi-source training environment aggregating datasets from the United States (CBIS-DDSM, EMBED), Portugal (INbreast, BCDR), and Cyprus (BMCD). To assess global generalizability, we evaluated performance on unseen cohorts from Egypt (CDD-CESM) and Sweden (CSAW-CC). We benchmarked Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) against a rigorously optimized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) baseline. Contrary to expectations, standard ERM consistently outperformed specialized invariant mechanisms on out-of-domain testing. While VREx showed potential in stabilizing attention maps, invariant objectives proved unstable and prone to underfitting. We conclude that engineering equitable AI is currently best served by maximizing multi-national data diversity rather than relying on complex algorithmic invariance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rectified flow models have achieved remarkable performance in image and video generation tasks. However, existing numerical solvers face a trade-off between fast sampling and high accuracy solutions, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications such as reconstruction and editing. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging the Adams Bashforth Moulton (ABM) predictor corrector method to enhance the accuracy of ODE solving in rectified flow models. Specifically, we introduce ABM Solver, which integrates a multi step predictor corrector approach to reduce local truncation errors and employs Adaptive Step Size Adjustment to improve sampling speed. Furthermore, to effectively preserve non edited regions while facilitating semantic modifications, we introduce a Mask Guided Feature Injection module. We estimate self-similarity to generate a spatial mask that differentiates preserved regions from those available for editing. Extensive experiments on multiple high resolution image datasets validate that ABM Solver significantly improves inversion precision and editing quality, outperforming existing solvers without requiring additional training or optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamza Pehlivan, Andrea Boscolo Camiletto, Lin Geng Foo, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for novel view synthesis due to its high rendering quality and fast inference time. However, 3DGS predominantly relies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training times. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization strategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), specifically tailored towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the Jacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only a limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free and GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we propose sampling strategies for both camera views and loss function and, consequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order approximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning rate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a result, our method achieves a 4x speedup over standard LM and outperforms Adam by ~5x when the Gaussian count is low while providing ~1.3x speed in moderate counts. In addition, our matrix-free implementation achieves 2x speedup over the concurrent second-order optimizer 3DGS-LM, while using 3.5x less memory.

<p><b>Authors:</b> S M Rayeed, Alyson East, Samuel Stevens, Sydne Record, Charles V Stewart</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator, making them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an underutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts to perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological differences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12 vision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed datasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from controlled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ) photographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important real-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show that the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best performing model, with 97% accuracy at genus and 94% at species level. Sample efficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to 50% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments reveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ images, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a foundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and beyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for diverse long-tailed ecological datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaning Zhang, Jiahe Zhang, Chunjie Ma, Weili Guan, Tian Gan, Zan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with a dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZSDFA), which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative PVLM attributor based on the vision-language model to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We propose to employ the inherent facial attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moulik Choraria, Xinbo Wu, Akhil Bhimaraju, Nitesh Sekhar, Yue Wu, Xu Zhang, Prateek Singhal, Lav R. Varshney</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperscaling of data and parameter count in LLMs is yielding diminishing improvement when weighed against training costs, underlining a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference without sacrificing performance. This is especially so for multimodal language models (MLMs), where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens can limit their practical viability. Parallely, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large MLMs, deepening our understanding of how MLMs process and encode information. Motivated by this, and our observation that MLMs naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper layers of the model, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities, (i) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, (ii) LTU for audio, and (iii) MoLCA for molecular data, and model sizes, starting from 350M to 13B parameters, indicate that our method reduces both training and inference costs, while at least preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengyang Jiang, Mengmeng Wang, Liuzhuozheng Li, Lei Zhang, Haoyu Wang, Wei Wei, Guang Dai, Yanning Zhang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that learning a meaningful internal representation can accelerate generative training. However, existing approaches necessitate to either introduce an off-the-shelf external representation task or rely on a large-scale, pre-trained external representation encoder to provide representation guidance during the training process. In this study, we posit that the unique discriminative process inherent to diffusion transformers enables them to offer such guidance without requiring external representation components. We propose SelfRepresentation Alignment (SRA), a simple yet effective method that obtains representation guidance using the internal representations of learned diffusion transformer. SRA aligns the latent representation of the diffusion transformer in the earlier layer conditioned on higher noise to that in the later layer conditioned on lower noise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only the training process. Experimental results indicate that applying SRA to DiTs and SiTs yields consistent performance improvements, and largely outperforms approaches relying on auxiliary representation task. Our approach achieves performance comparable to methods that are dependent on an external pre-trained representation encoder, which demonstrates the feasibility of acceleration with representation alignment in diffusion transformers themselves.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Mu, Zhitong Xiong, Yi Wang, Muhammad Shahzad, Franz Essl, Holger Kreft, Mark van Kleunen, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for biodiversity monitoring, forest management, and ecological research. However, progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3 million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and 21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badhan Mazumder, Lei Wu, Vince D. Calhoun, Dong Hye Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaining insights into the structural and functional mechanisms of the brain has been a longstanding focus in neuroscience research, particularly in the context of understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia (SZ). Nevertheless, most of the traditional multimodal deep learning approaches fail to fully leverage the complementary characteristics of structural and functional connectomics data to enhance diagnostic performance. To address this issue, we proposed ConneX, a multimodal fusion method that integrates cross-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-Mixer for refined feature fusion. Modality-specific backbone graph neural networks (GNNs) were firstly employed to obtain feature representation for each modality. A unified cross-modal attention network was then introduced to fuse these embeddings by capturing intra- and inter-modal interactions, while MLP-Mixer layers refined global and local features, leveraging higher-order dependencies for end-to-end classification with a multi-head joint loss. Extensive evaluations demonstrated improved performance on two distinct clinical datasets, highlighting the robustness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiteng Li, Hanxuan Li, Junyi Wu, Kai Liu, Haotong Qin, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on computation-heavy and inflexible calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) Bounded-init Grid Refinement (BGR) and (2) Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS) for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately 2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on advanced DiT models while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/lhxcs/DVD-Quant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arman Zarei, Samyadeep Basu, Keivan Rezaei, Zihao Lin, Sayan Nag, Soheil Feizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H), a closely related construct, is the primary reasons why individuals delay, avoid, or abandon health behaviour changes. It is a subtle and conflicting emotion that sets a person in a state between positive and negative orientations, or between acceptance and refusal to do something. It manifests by a discord in affect between multiple modalities or within a modality, such as facial and vocal expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to recognize A/H as done for in-person interactions, integrating them into digital health interventions is costly and less effective. Automatic A/H recognition is therefore critical for the personalization and cost-effectiveness of digital behaviour change interventions. However, no datasets currently exists for the design of machine learning models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces the Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains 1,427 videos with a total duration of 10.60 hours captured from 300 participants across Canada answering predefined questions to elicit A/H. It is intended to mirror real-world online personalized behaviour change interventions. BAH is annotated by three experts to provide timestamps that indicate where A/H occurs, and frame- and video-level annotations with A/H cues. Video transcripts, cropped and aligned faces, and participants' meta-data are also provided. Since A and H manifest similarly in practice, we provide a binary annotation indicating the presence or absence of A/H. Additionally, this paper includes benchmarking results using baseline models on BAH for frame- and video-level recognition, zero-shot prediction, and personalization using source-free domain adaptation. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lujian Yao, Siming Zheng, Xinbin Yuan, Zhuoxuan Cai, Pu Wu, Jinwei Chen, Bo Li, Peng-Tao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from less favorable to aesthetically enhanced perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p>

This work presents a novel equivariant solver for assembly tasks based on flow matching models. We first theoretically show that the key to learning equivariant distributions via flow matching is to learn related vector fields. Based on this result, we propose an assembly model, called equivariant diffusion assembly (Eda), which learns related vector fields conditioned on the input pieces. We further construct an equivariant path for Eda, which guarantees high data efficiency of the training process. Our numerical results show that Eda is highly competitive on practical datasets, and it can even handle the challenging situation where the input pieces are non-overlapped.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhou, Junbao Zhou, Qingshan Xu, Kesen Zhao, Yuxuan Wang, Hao Fei, Richang Hong, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention from the community. However, it faces two key challenges: (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}}) current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing approaches. Code will be released on github.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Angel F. Garc\'ia-Fern\'andez, Giorgio Battistelli</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically, we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach compared to other distributed multi-object filters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Gross, Aya Fahmy, Danit Niwattananan, Dominik Muhle, Rui Song, Daniel Cremers, Henri Mee{\ss}</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding. While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based approaches utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first method that leverages context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Extensive experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art in-domain performance, exhibits superior zero-shot generalization on out-of-domain data, and achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14x. These results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang-Hwan Son, Cheol-Hwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p>

MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Duc Chu, Kshitij Pawar, Zihao He, Roxanna Sharifi, Ross Sonnenblick, Magdalayna Curry, Laura D'Adamo, Lindsay Young, Stuart B Murray, Kristina Lerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms face escalating challenges in detecting harmful content that promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors and cognitions (bigorexia). This content can evade moderation by camouflaging as legitimate fitness advice and disproportionately affects adolescent males. We address this challenge with BigTokDetect, a clinically informed framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal benchmark dataset of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychiatrists across five categories and eighteen fine-grained subcategories. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals that while commercial zero-shot models achieve the highest accuracy on broad primary categories, supervised fine-tuning enables smaller open-source models to perform better on fine-grained subcategory detection. Ablation studies show that multimodal fusion improves performance by 5 to 15 percent, with video features providing the most discriminative signals. These findings support a grounded moderation approach that automates detection of explicit harms while flagging ambiguous content for human review, and they establish a scalable framework for harm mitigation in emerging mental health domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Wang, Ziqi Huang, Ruoxi Jia, Paul Debevec, Ning Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahajpreet Singh, Kokil Jaidka, Subhayan Mukerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Online hate remains a significant societal challenge, especially as multimodal content enables subtle, culturally grounded, and implicit forms of harm. Hateful memes embed hostility through text-image interactions and humor, making them difficult for automated systems to interpret. Although recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on explicit cases, their deployment is limited by high inference costs and persistent failures on nuanced content. This work examines how far small models can be improved through prompt optimization, fine-tuning, and automated data augmentation. We introduce an end-to-end pipeline that varies prompt structure, label granularity, and training modality, showing that structured prompts and scaled supervision significantly strengthen compact VLMs. We also develop a multimodal augmentation framework that generates counterfactually neutral memes via a coordinated LLM-VLM setup, reducing spurious correlations and improving the detection of implicit hate. Ablation studies quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that prompt design, granular labels, and targeted augmentation collectively narrow the gap between small and large models. The results offer a practical path toward more robust and deployable multimodal hate-detection systems without relying on costly large-model inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Niu, Jaemin Cho, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench, a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotated images. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Feng, Shikang Zheng, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Qinming Zhou, Peiliang Cai, Xinyu Wang, Junjie Chen, Chang Zou, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but often incur prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. Recent feature caching methods accelerate inference via temporal extrapolation, yet can suffer quality degradation from inaccurate modeling of the complex dynamics of feature evolution. We propose HiCache (Hermite Polynomial-based Feature Cache), a training-free acceleration framework that improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature-derivative approximations in diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials as a potentially optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy, and is also effective when applied standalone or integrated with TaylorSeer. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority, achieving 5.55x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while matching or exceeding baseline quality, and maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Moreover, HiCache can be naturally added to previous caching methods to enhance their performance, e.g., improving ClusCa from 0.9480 to 0.9840 in terms of image rewards.

<p>Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications, understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age, and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date.

We benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a question.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Broedermannn, Christos Sakaridis, Luigi Piccinelli, Wim Abbeloos, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses. State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DeLiVER datasets.

<p>Abstract: Understanding cultural heritage artifacts such as ancient Greek pottery requires expert-level reasoning that remains challenging for current MLLMs due to limited domain-specific data. We introduce VaseVQA, a benchmark of 31,773 images and 67,614 question-answer pairs across seven expert-defined categories, enabling systematic evaluation of expert-level cultural heritage understanding. Using this dataset, we explore effective training strategies for domain-specific reasoning. While supervised fine-tuning improves adaptation to domain knowledge, it struggles with deeper reasoning tasks. We propose VaseVL, which augments SFT with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards. Experiments show that VaseVL consistently outperforms supervised baselines, especially on reasoning-intensive questions, highlighting the value of targeted reinforcement learning for cultural heritage visual question answering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhitao Zeng, Guojian Yuan, Junyuan Mao, Yuxuan Wang, Xiaoshuang Jia, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglin Li, Feng Han, Yikun Wang, Ruilin Li, Shuai Dong, Haowen Hou, Haitao Li, Qianglong Chen, Feng Tao, Jingqi Tong, Yin Zhang, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driven by the simple and effective Dense O2O, DEIM demonstrates faster convergence and enhanced performance. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Gu, Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel, Ali Nouri, Lydia Armini, Christian Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings, even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in: https://github.com/Claud1234/PCICF</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Yazdan Parast, Parsa Hosseini, Hesam Asadollahzadeh, Arshia Soltani Moakhar, Basim Azam, Soheil Feizi, Naveed Akhtar</p>
<p>Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models demonstrate impressive realism but suffer from a persistent identity crisis when generating scenes with multiple humans: producing duplicate faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals. We present DisCo (Reinforcement with DiverSity Constraints), a novel reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes identity diversity both within images and across groups of generated samples. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by a compositional reward that: (i) penalizes facial similarity within images, (ii) discourages identity repetition across samples, (iii) enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity via human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as prompt complexity increases, requiring no additional annotations. On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6% Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our results establish cross-sample diversity as a critical axis for resolving identity collapse in generative models, and position DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution for multi-human image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ardalan Aryashad, Parsa Razmara, Amin Mahjoub, Seyedarmin Azizi, Mahdi Salmani, Arad Firouzkouhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist, from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models, improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, raising concerns about real-world transferability.
  We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of defogging pipelines, including classical dehazing filters, modern defogging networks, chained variants combining filters and models, and prompt-driven visual language image editing models applied directly to foggy images. To bridge the gap between simulated and physical environments, we evaluate these pipelines on both the synthetic Foggy Cityscapes dataset and the real-world Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC).
  We examine generalization by evaluating performance on synthetic fog and real-world conditions, assessing both image quality and downstream perception in terms of object detection mean average precision and segmentation panoptic quality. Our analysis identifies when defogging is effective, the impact of combining models, and how visual language models compare to traditional approaches. We additionally report qualitative rubric-based evaluations from both human and visual language model judges and analyze their alignment with downstream task metrics.
  Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and identify the conditions under which pre-processing meaningfully improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiran Wu, Zhuorui Yu, Yunze Liu, Chi-Hao Wu, Enmin Zhou, Junxiao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyi Yao, Xinyao Han, Ruibo Ming, Zhihang Song, Lihui Peng, Jianming Hu, Danya Yao, Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a major obstacle to model generalization. To address this challenge from a data-centric perspective, this paper introduces a profile extraction and discovery framework for characterizing the style profiles underlying both synthetic and real image datasets. We propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized profiling-based quality control paradigm that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shasha Guo, Liang Pang, Xi Wang, Yanling Wang, Huawei Shen, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Recent attempts construct auxiliary lines via code-driven rendering, a strategy that relies on accurate and executable code generation to produce visual renderings of the auxiliary lines for subsequent reasoning. However, in complex solid geometry settings, such a strong dependence on precise specifications substantially restricts the robustness of this strategy. Alternatively, we turn to a simpler and more stable solution, representing auxiliary-line constructions as structured textual descriptions. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances diagram-text alignment. The core is a cross-modal reward model that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description matches the ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. The reward signal drives a GRPO-based RL stage to yield informative auxiliary-line descriptions for the reasoning. To support the training and evaluation, we develop a scalable data pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of 3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual fields. Based on this framework, we derive GeoVLMath, an LVLM for solving complex solid geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Chen Zhengyu Tan, Zheng Weihua, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen, Hwaran Lee, Kenny Tsu Wei Choo, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding. We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset, BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16 regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only baseline querying from Region $\rightarrow$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant (Entity $\rightarrow$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation. BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge; models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing. While visual cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights the challenges of robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly in lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/BLEnD-Vis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Hanwei Zhu, Yan Zhong, Jiamang Wang, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

<p>Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50% in R^2 and 12% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is a leading technology for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), offering a non-intrusive and cost-effective solution for healthcare and smart environments. Despite its potential, existing methods struggle with domain shift issues, often failing to generalize to unseen environments due to overfitting. This paper proposes IBIS, a robust ensemble framework combining Inception-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification of Doppler signatures. The proposed architecture specifically targets generalization capabilities. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that IBIS achieves 95.40% accuracy, delivering a 7.58% performance gain compared to standard architectures in cross-scenario evaluations on external datasets. The analysis confirms that IBIS effectively mitigates environmental dependency in Wi-Fi-based HAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihab Aaqil Ahamed, Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige, Ranga Rodrigo, Muhammad Haris Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability, trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably, our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishchal Sapkota, Haoyan Shi, Yejia Zhang, Xianshi Ma, Bofang Zheng, Fabian Vazquez, Pengfei Gu, Danny Z. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Mu, Guihai Chen, Xun Yang, Erkun Yang, Cheng Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Hu, Mingyu Zhou, Shuai Yuan, Hongbo Hu, Zhenming Peng, Tian Pu, Xiying Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) faces two major challenges: a lack of discernible target texture and severe background clutter, which results in the background obscuring the target. To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net. Extensive experiments on SISTD and MISTD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the SISTD task, SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net performs well compared to most established networks. On the MISTD datasets, STD$^\mathrm{2}$Net achieves a mIoU of 87.68\%, outperforming SD$^\mathrm{2}$Net, which achieves a mIoU of 64.97\%.

<p>Abstract: Camouflage is primarily context-dependent yet current metrics for camouflaged scenarios overlook this critical factor. Instead, these metrics are originally designed for evaluating general or salient objects, with an inherent assumption of uncorrelated spatial context. In this paper, we propose a new contextualized evaluation paradigm, Context-measure, built upon a probabilistic pixel-aware correlation framework. By incorporating spatial dependencies and pixel-wise camouflage quantification, our measure better aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments across three challenging camouflaged object segmentation datasets show that Context-measure delivers more reliability than existing context-independent metrics. Our measure can provide a foundational evaluation benchmark for various computer vision applications involving camouflaged patterns, such as agricultural, industrial, and medical scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyue Sun, Tailin Chen, Yinghui Zhang, Yuchen Zhang, Jiangbei Yue, Jianbo Jiao, Zeyu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Cazzola, Ahed Alboody</p>
<p>Abstract: The acquisition cost for large, annotated motion datasets remains a critical bottleneck for skeletal-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangzhong Liu, Jiajie Zhang, Hao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In automotive sensor fusion systems, smart sensors and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) modules are commonly utilized. Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-32B scores 74.3 on MMSearch and 54.4 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5.2. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yating Wang, Yuan Sun, Xuan Wang, Ran Yi, Boyao Zhou, Yipengjing Sun, Hongyu Liu, Yinuo Wang, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent 3D-aware head generative models based on 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve real-time, photorealistic and view-consistent head synthesis. However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup. We further introduce a distillation strategy to generate high-quality normals for realistic rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method preserves high-quality generation and real-time rendering, while simultaneously supporting explicit lighting and viewpoint editing. We will publicly release our code and dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Wang, Ang Cao, Liam J. Wang, Jeong Joon Park</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. Existing methods often struggle near depth discontinuities, where standard regression losses encourage spatial averaging and thus blur sharp boundaries. To address this issue, we introduce a mixture-of-experts formulation that handles uncertainty at depth boundaries by combining multiple smooth depth predictions. A softmax weighting head dynamically selects among these hypotheses on a per-pixel basis. By integrating our mixture model into a pre-trained state-of-the-art 3D model, we achieve a substantial reduction of boundary artifacts and gains in overall reconstruction accuracy. Notably, our approach is highly compute efficient, delivering generalizable improvements even when fine-tuned on a small subset of training data while incurring only negligible additional inference computation, suggesting a promising direction for lightweight and accurate 3D reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Eppel</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) have the ability to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.</p>

<p>Abstract: From Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to robotics, existing egocentric datasets primarily focus on action recognition tasks, while largely overlooking the inherent role of motion analysis in sports and other fast-movement scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a real-time motion focus recognition method that estimates the subject's locomotion intention from any egocentric video. We leverage the foundation model for camera pose estimation and introduce system-level optimizations to enable efficient and scalable inference. Evaluated on a collected egocentric action dataset, our method achieves real-time performance with manageable memory consumption through a sliding batch inference strategy. This work makes motion-centric analysis practical for edge deployment and offers a complementary perspective to existing egocentric studies on sports and fast-movement activities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selim Emir Can, Jan Ackermann, Kiyohiro Nakayama, Ruofan Liu, Tong Wu, Yang Zheng, Hugo Bertiche, Menglei Chai, Thabo Beeler, Gordon Wetzstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (i) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria; (ii) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier; and (iii) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show how specific infrastructure (e.g., barns, lagoons) shapes classification decisions. We release code, infrastructure masks, and descriptors to support transparent, scalable monitoring of livestock infrastructure, enabling risk modeling, change detection, and targeted regulatory action.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Belal Shaheen, Minh-Hieu Nguyen, Bach-Thuan Bui,  Shubham, Tim Wu, Michael Fairley, Matthew David Zane, Michael Wu, James Tompkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial remote sensing enables efficient large-area surveying, but accurate direct object-level measurement remains difficult in complex natural scenes. Recent advancements in 3D vision, particularly learned radiance-field representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have begun to raise the ceiling on reconstruction fidelity and densifiable geometry from posed imagery. Nevertheless, direct aerial measurement of important natural attributes such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH) remains challenging. Trunks in aerial forest scans are distant and sparsely observed in image views: at typical operating altitudes, stems may span only a few pixels. With these constraints, conventional reconstruction methods leave breast-height trunk geometry weakly constrained. We present TreeDGS, an aerial image reconstruction method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous, densifiable scene representation for trunk measurement. After SfM--MVS initialization and Gaussian optimization, we extract a dense point set from the Gaussian field using RaDe-GS's depth-aware cumulative-opacity integration and associate each sample with a multi-view opacity reliability score. Then, we estimate DBH from trunk-isolated points using opacity-weighted solid-circle fitting. Evaluated on 10 plots with field-measured DBH, TreeDGS reaches 4.79,cm RMSE (about 2.6 pixels at this GSD) and outperforms a state-of-the-art LiDAR baseline (7.91,cm RMSE). This shows that TreeDGS can enable accurate, low-cost aerial DBH measurement</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Hong, Ning Dong, Yicheng Di, Xiaolong Xu, Rongsheng Hu, Yihua Shao, Run Ling, Yun Wang, Juqin Wang, Zhanjie Zhang, Ao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Image style transfer aims to integrate the visual patterns of a specific artistic style into a content image while preserving its content structure. Existing methods mainly rely on the generative adversarial network (GAN) or stable diffusion (SD). GAN-based approaches using CNNs or Transformers struggle to jointly capture local and global dependencies, leading to artifacts and disharmonious patterns. SD-based methods reduce such issues but often fail to preserve content structures and suffer from slow inference. To address these issues, we revisit GAN and propose a mamba-based generator, termed as StyMam, to produce high-quality stylized images without introducing artifacts and disharmonious patterns. Specifically, we introduce a mamba-based generator with a residual dual-path strip scanning mechanism and a channel-reweighted spatial attention module. The former efficiently captures local texture features, while the latter models global dependencies. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both quality and speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Zhang, Shudong Yang, Jinlan Fu, See-Kiong Ng, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofan Yang, Yubin Liu, Wei Pan, Guoqing Chu, Junming Zhang, Jie Zhao, Zhuoqi Man, Xuanming Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal detection have significantly improved detection accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., low light, overexposure). By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA. Our architecture includes an Intra-Hypergraph Enhancement module to capture global many-to-many high-order relationships within each modality, and an Inter-Hypergraph Fusion module to align, enhance, and fuse cross-modal features by bridging configuration and spatial gaps between data sources. We further introduce a M2-FullPAD module to enable adaptive multi-level fusion of multi-modal enhanced features within the network, meanwhile enhancing data distribution and flow across the architecture. Extensive object detection experiments on multiple public datasets against baselines demonstrate that M2I2HA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object detection tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >= 50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360{\deg} scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360{\deg} scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangfan Xu, Lilian Zhang, Xiaofeng He, Pengdong Wu, Wenqi Wu, Jun Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinkai Liu, Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, Li Qiao, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Mehdi Bennis</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used for heart model reconstruction and digital twin computational analysis because of its ability to visualize soft tissues and capture dynamic functions. However, CMR images have an anisotropic nature, characterized by large inter-slice distances and misalignments from cardiac motion. These limitations result in data loss and measurement inaccuracies, hindering the capture of detailed anatomical structures. In this work, we introduce MorphiNet, a novel network that reproduces heart anatomy learned from high-resolution Computed Tomography (CT) images, unpaired with CMR images. MorphiNet encodes the anatomical structure as gradient fields, deforming template meshes into patient-specific geometries. A multilayer graph subdivision network refines these geometries while maintaining a dense point correspondence, suitable for computational analysis. MorphiNet achieved state-of-the-art bi-ventricular myocardium reconstruction on CMR patients with tetralogy of Fallot with 0.3 higher Dice score and 2.6 lower Hausdorff distance compared to the best existing template-based methods. While matching the anatomical fidelity of comparable neural implicit function methods, MorphiNet delivered 50$\times$ faster inference. Cross-dataset validation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge confirmed robust generalization, achieving a 0.7 Dice score with 30\% improvement over previous template-based approaches. We validate our anatomical learning approach through the successful restoration of missing cardiac structures and demonstrate significant improvement over standard Loop subdivision. Motion tracking experiments further confirm MorphiNet's capability for cardiac function analysis, including accurate ejection fraction calculation that correctly identifies myocardial dysfunction in tetralogy of Fallot patients.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent MLLMs have shown emerging visual understanding and reasoning abilities after being pre-trained on large-scale multimodal datasets. Unlike pre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment, instruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading to the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual forgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual learning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing visual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention, which further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the degradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation through the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that leads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on this view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that regulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual representations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the information bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual understanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual knowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight instruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach using gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational overhead while preserving rich visual representations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks and backbone MLLMs demonstrate that MDGD effectively mitigates visual forgetting from pre-trained tasks while enabling strong adaptation to new tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchen Fu, Xuri Ge, Kaiwen Zheng, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Xin Xin, Yongxin Ni, Joemon M. Jose</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where micro-videos dominate platforms like TikTok and YouTube, AI-generated content is nearing cinematic quality. The next frontier is using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously create viral micro-videos, a largely untapped potential that could shape the future of AI-driven content creation. To address this gap, this paper presents the first exploration of LLM-assisted popular micro-video generation (LLMPopcorn). We selected popcorn as the icon for this paper because it symbolizes leisure and entertainment, aligning with this study on leveraging LLMs as assistants for generating popular micro-videos that are often consumed during leisure time. Specifically, we empirically study the following research questions: (i) How can LLMs be effectively utilized to assist popular micro-video generation? (ii) To what extent can prompt-based enhancements optimize the LLM-generated content for higher popularity? (iii) How well do various LLMs and video generators perform in the popular micro-video generation task? Exploring these questions, we show that advanced LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 can generate micro-videos with popularity rivaling human content. Prompt enhancement further boosts results, while benchmarking highlights DeepSeek-V3 and R1 for LLMs, and LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo for video generation. This work advances AI-assisted micro-video creation and opens new research directions. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/LLMPopcorn.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\"uveyda Yilmaz, Zhu Chen, Yuli Wu, Johannes Stegmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell microscopy data are abundant; however, corresponding segmentation annotations remain scarce. Moreover, variations in cell types, imaging devices, and staining techniques introduce significant domain gaps between datasets. As a result, even large, pretrained segmentation models trained on diverse datasets (source datasets) struggle to generalize to unseen datasets (target datasets). To overcome this generalization problem, we propose CellStyle, which improves the segmentation quality of such models without requiring labels for the target dataset, thereby enabling zero-shot adaptation. CellStyle transfers the attributes of an unannotated target dataset, such as texture, color, and noise, to the annotated source dataset. This transfer is performed while preserving the cell shapes of the source images, ensuring that the existing source annotations can still be used while maintaining the visual characteristics of the target dataset. The styled synthetic images with the existing annotations enable the finetuning of a generalist segmentation model for application to the unannotated target data. We demonstrate that CellStyle significantly improves zero-shot cell segmentation performance across diverse datasets by finetuning multiple segmentation models on the style-transferred data. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Shivaram Bhat, Shakib Yazdani, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms all considered baselines by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badhan Mazumder, Ayush Kanyal, Lei Wu, Vince D. Calhoun, Dong Hye Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical studies reveal disruptions in brain structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ). Traditional approaches might rely solely on SC due to limited functional data availability, hindering comprehension of cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with SZ by neglecting the intricate SC-FC interrelationship. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel physics-guided deep learning framework that leverages a neural oscillation model to describe the dynamics of a collection of interconnected neural oscillators, which operate via nerve fibers dispersed across the brain's structure. Our proposed framework utilizes SC to simultaneously generate FC by learning SC-FC coupling from a system dynamics perspective. Additionally, it employs a novel multi-view graph neural network (GNN) with a joint loss to perform correlation-based SC-FC fusion and classification of individuals with SZ. Experiments conducted on a clinical dataset exhibited improved performance, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Baracaldo, Blythe King, Haoran Yan, Yizi Lin, Nina Miolane, Mengyang Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy, they depend on high-quality labeled images, making them unsuitable for segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghun Baek, Kazuki Egashira, Shota Onohara, Atsuyuki Miyai, Yuki Imajuku, Hikaru Ikuta, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526 high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the richly narrative domain of manga.</p>

<p>Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xia, Jinglu Wang, Yibo Peng, Kaide Zeng, Zihan Dong, Xian Wu, Xiangru Tang, Hongtu Zhu, Yun Li, Linjun Zhang, Shujie Liu, Yan Lu, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy with dynamic entropy regulation, progressively teaching the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 23.6% over strong baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN) architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500 distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding, performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are transforming computational pathology by offering new ways to analyze histopathology images. However, FMs typically require weeks of training on large databases, making their creation a resource-intensive process. In this paper, we present a training for foundation models from whole slide images using supervised, end-to-end, multitask learning on slide-level labels. Notably, it is the first model to incorporate cancer subtyping, risk estimation, and genetic mutation prediction into one model. The presented model outperforms self-supervised models on seven benchmark tasks while the training only required 5% of the computational resources. The results not only show that supervised training can outperform self-supervision with less data, but also offer a solution to annotation problems, as patient-based labels are widely available through routine clinical processes. Furthermore, an attention module provides a layer of explainability across different tasks and serves as a tumor detector for unseen cancer types. To address the issue of closed-source datasets, the model was fully trained on openly available data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinqin Yang, Firoozeh Shomal-Zadeh, Ali Gholipour</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly advanced neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit substantial heterogeneity, known as batch effects or site effects. These non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals, reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization is grounded in the central hypothesis that site-related biases can be eliminated or mitigated while preserving meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, methodological advances, publicly available datasets, and evaluation metrics in the field of MRI harmonization. We systematically cover the full imaging pipeline and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition and reconstruction, retrospective image-level and feature-level methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. By synthesizing existing methods and evidence, we revisit the central hypothesis of image harmonization and show that, although site invariance can be achieved with current techniques, further evaluation is required to verify the preservation of biological information. To this end, we summarize the remaining challenges and highlight key directions for future research, including the need for standardized validation benchmarks, improved evaluation strategies, and tighter integration of harmonization methods across the imaging pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louie Hong Yao, Nicholas Jarvis, Tianyu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs. grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation, which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities, resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu dataset shows that each image maps to around four sense clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgments, offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge, complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhong, Yi Yang, Changjian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics, especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Tao, Yinuo Wang, Jinzhao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for motion control trains policies directly from sensor inputs to motor commands, enabling unified controllers for different robots and tasks. However, most existing methods are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context. We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations (e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for resource-constrained robotic and autonomous systems in engineering informatics applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 18 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. For closed-source models lacking token-level logprob access, we develop and validate instruction-guided likelihood proxies. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Wang, Dingyou Wang, Jiaming Hu, Qixuan Zhang, Jingyi Yu, Lan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: A deep understanding of kinematic structures and movable components is essential for enabling robots to manipulate objects and model their own articulated forms. Such understanding is captured through articulated objects, which are essential for tasks such as physical simulation, motion planning, and policy learning. However, creating these models, particularly for objects with high degrees of freedom (DoF), remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on motion sequences or strong assumptions from hand-curated datasets, which hinders scalability. In this paper, we introduce Kinematify, an automated framework that synthesizes articulated objects directly from arbitrary RGB images or textual descriptions. Our method addresses two core challenges: (i) inferring kinematic topologies for high-DoF objects and (ii) estimating joint parameters from static geometry. To achieve this, we combine MCTS search for structural inference with geometry-driven optimization for joint reasoning, producing physically consistent and functionally valid descriptions. We evaluate Kinematify on diverse inputs from both synthetic and real-world environments, demonstrating improvements in registration and kinematic topology accuracy over prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masih Aminbeidokhti, Subhankar Roy, Eric Granger, Elisa Ricci, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\rho$) and head-tail ratio ($\eta$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce MERA Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (imageto-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Bai, Alexey Taymanov, Tong Zhang, Aviral Kumar, Spencer Whitehead</p>
<p>Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15197">LangForce: Bayesian Decomposition of Vision Language Action Models via Latent Action Queries</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Lian, Bin Yu, Xiaopeng Lin, Laurence T. Yang, Zhaolong Shen, Changti Wu, Yuzhuo Miao, Cong Huang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise in robot manipulation but often struggle to generalize to new instructions or complex multi-task scenarios. We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose LangForce, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\pi(a \mid v, \ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, LangForce significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.</p>
