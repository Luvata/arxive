<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Wang, Shuo Wang, Xin Nie, Yasutaka Narazaki, Thomas Matiki, Billie F. Spencer Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in civil infrastructure inspections underscore the need for precise three-dimensional (3D) damage visualization on digital twins, transcending traditional 2D image-based damage identifications. Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time. Demonstrated on an open-source synthetic dataset for post-earthquake inspections, the proposed approach offers a promising solution for comprehensive 3D damage visualization in civil infrastructure digital twins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boda Lin, Yongjie Zhu, Wenyu Qin, Meng Wang, Pengfei Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is evolving beyond single-number mean opinion score toward richer, multi-faceted evaluations of video content. In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations and reinforcement-based alignment in advancing video quality assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Man, Roy Ganz, Roi Ronen, Shahar Tsiper, Shai Mazor, Niv Nayman</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a fundamental task for digitizing information, serving as a critical bridge between visual data and textual understanding. While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16915">StereoAdapter-2: Globally Structure-Consistent Underwater Stereo Depth Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Ren, Xiang Li, Yiran Wang, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is fundamental to underwater robotic perception, yet suffers from severe domain shifts caused by wavelength-dependent light attenuation, scattering, and refraction. Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakib Ahammed, Xia Cui, Xinqi Fan, Wenqi Lu, Moi Hoon Yap</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision models increasingly rely on rich semantic representations that extend beyond class labels to include descriptive concepts and contextual attributes. However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Xray-Visual, a unified vision model architecture for large-scale image and video understanding trained on industry-scale social media data. Our model leverages over 15 billion curated image-text pairs and 10 billion video-hashtag pairs from Facebook and Instagram, employing robust data curation pipelines that incorporate balancing and noise suppression strategies to maximize semantic diversity while minimizing label noise. We introduce a three-stage training pipeline that combines self-supervised MAE, semi-supervised hashtag classification, and CLIP-style contrastive learning to jointly optimize image and video modalities. Our architecture builds on a Vision Transformer backbone enhanced with efficient token reorganization (EViT) for improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Xray-Visual achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, including ImageNet for image classification, Kinetics and HMDB51 for video understanding, and MSCOCO for cross-modal retrieval. The model exhibits strong robustness to domain shift and adversarial perturbations. We further demonstrate that integrating large language models as text encoders (LLM2CLIP) significantly enhances retrieval performance and generalization capabilities, particularly in real-world environments. Xray-Visual establishes new benchmarks for scalable, multimodal vision models, while maintaining superior accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibon Ku, Talukder Z. Jubery, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate, high-throughput characterization of agricultural produce quality and plant phenotypes, both essential for advancing agricultural sustainability and breeding programs. HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahye Kim, Deepti Ghadiyaram, Raghudeep Gadde</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\times$ and $3.2\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16979">Characterizing the Predictive Impact of Modalities with Supervised Latent-Variable Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyam Madaan, Sumit Chopra, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing approaches predominantly assume the availability of multiple modalities during training and inference. In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Chen, Patricia Alves-Oliveira</p>
<p>Abstract: As agentic AI becomes increasingly involved in creative production, documenting authorship has become critical for artists, collectors, and legal contexts. We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peize Li, Zeyu Zhang, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image 3D generation with part-level structure remains challenging: learned priors struggle to cover the long tail of part geometries and maintain multi-view consistency, and existing systems provide limited support for precise, localized edits. We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s. Qualitatively, PartRAG produces sharper part boundaries, better thin-structure fidelity, and robust behavior on articulated objects. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PartRAG.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaojie Yang, Tian Li, Yue Zhang, Jun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures have significantly advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs and deployment barriers. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient compression framework that transforms the 60-layer dual-stream MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight models without training from scratch. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like DPG-Bench and LongText-Bench show that Amber-Image achieves high-fidelity synthesis and superior text rendering, matching much larger models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joongwon Chae, Lihui Luo, Yang Liu, Runming Wang, Dongmei Yu, Zeming Liang, Xi Yuan, Dayan Zhang, Zhenglin Chen, Peiwu Qin, Ilmoon Chae</p>
<p>Abstract: Max pooling is the de facto standard for converting anomaly score maps into image-level decisions in memory-bank-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). However, because it relies on a single extreme response, it discards most information about how anomaly evidence is distributed and structured across the image, often causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap.
  We propose StructCore, a training-free, structure-aware image-level scoring method that goes beyond max pooling. Given an anomaly score map, StructCore computes a low-dimensional structural descriptor phi(S) that captures distributional and spatial characteristics, and refines image-level scoring via a diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from train-good samples, without modifying pixel-level localization.
  StructCore achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection by exploiting structural signatures missed by max pooling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunsuke Kikuchi, Atsushi Kouno, Hiroki Matsuzaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Trocar ports are camera-fixed, pseudo-static structures that can persistently occlude laparoscopic views and attract disproportionate feature points due to specular, textured surfaces. This makes ports particularly detrimental to geometry-based downstream pipelines such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM, where dynamic or non-anatomical outliers degrade alignment and tracking stability. Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP. Experiments demonstrate that geometrically consistent annotations substantially improve cross-dataset robustness beyond what dataset size alone provides.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shogo Sato, Kazuo Tanaka, Shojun Ogasawara, Kazuki Yamamoto, Kazuhiko Murasaki, Ryuichi Tanida, Jun Kataoka</p>
<p>Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transient phenomena in the universe and serve as powerful probes for high-energy astrophysical processes. In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Shiang Gau, Konstantinos D. Polyzos, Athanasios Bacharis, Saketh Madhuvarasu, Tara Javidi</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiromichi Kamata, Samuel Arthur Munro, Fuminori Homma</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation is essential for real-time editing of pre-reconstructed assets in film and game production. However, existing methods rely on predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency use. We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy. Experiments on multiple datasets show that B$^3$-Seg achieves competitive results to high-cost supervised methods while operating end-to-end segmentation within a few seconds. The results demonstrate that B$^3$-Seg enables practical, interactive 3DGS segmentation with provable information efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Liang, Yongcheng Jing, Yingjie Wang, Jiaxing Huang, Ee-chien Chang, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models faces two key challenges: stealthiness and persistence. Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwei Shan, Zeyu Cai, Yirui Li, Yongbo Chen, Lijun Han, Yun-hui Liu, Hesheng Wang, Shing Shin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) is a fundamental capability for autonomous perception and navigation. However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17186">Selective Training for Large Vision Language Models via Visual Information Gain</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seulbi Lee, Sangheum Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet they often suffer from language bias, producing answers without relying on visual evidence. While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahong Wang, Juncheng Wu, Zhangkai Ni, Chengmei Yang, Yihang Liu, Longzhen Yang, Yuyin Zhou, Ying Wen, Lianghua He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) incur substantial inference cost due to the processing of hundreds of visual tokens per image. Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an "Entropy Collapse Layer" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Zhu, Kaleb S. Newman, Johannes F. Lutzeyer, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Michal Drozdzal, Olga Russakovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite high semantic alignment, modern text-to-image (T2I) generative models still struggle to synthesize diverse images from a given prompt. This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17231">HiMAP: History-aware Map-occupancy Prediction with Fallback</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Xu, Yi Yang, Hao Cheng, Monika Sester</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for autonomous driving, yet most predictors rely on multi-object tracking (MOT) with identity association, assuming that objects are correctly and continuously tracked. When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\% in FDE, 12\% in ADE, and a 4\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Hamoudzadeh, Valeria Belloni, Roberta Ravanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates whether the geospatial and multimodal features encoded in \textit{Earth Embeddings} can effectively guide deep learning (DL) regression models for regional surface height mapping. In particular, we focused on AlphaEarth Embeddings at 10 m spatial resolution and evaluated their capability to support terrain height inference using a high-quality Digital Surface Model (DSM) as reference. U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns. Overall, the results demonstrate the promising potential of AlphaEarth Embeddings to guide DL-based height mapping workflows, particularly when combined with spatially aware convolutional architectures, while emphasizing the need to address bias for improved regional transferability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Freight vehicles approaching signalized intersections require reliable detection and motion estimation to support infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority (FSP). Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in foundation video generators such as Sora2, Veo3, and other commercial systems have produced highly realistic synthetic videos, exposing the limitations of existing detection methods that rely on shallow embedding trajectories, image-based adaptation, or computationally heavy MLLMs. We propose EA-Swin, an Embedding-Agnostic Swin Transformer that models spatiotemporal dependencies directly on pretrained video embeddings via a factorized windowed attention design, making it compatible with generic ViT-style patch-based encoders. Alongside the model, we construct the EA-Video dataset, a benchmark dataset comprising 130K videos that integrates newly collected samples with curated existing datasets, covering diverse commercial and open-source generators and including unseen-generator splits for rigorous cross-distribution evaluation. Extensive experiments show that EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior SoTA methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions, establishing a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruoyi Zhang, Jiawei Yuan, Lujia Ye, Runling Yu, Liling Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is indispensable for tracking the genesis, intensification, and trajectory of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, existing deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods often treat satellite image sequences as generic videos, neglecting the underlying atmospheric physical laws governing cloud motion. To address this, we propose a Physics Encoded Spatial and Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (PESTGAN) for TC image super-resolution. Specifically, we design a disentangled generator architecture incorporating a PhyCell module, which approximates the vorticity equation via constrained convolutions and encodes the resulting approximate physical dynamics as implicit latent representations to separate physical dynamics from visual textures. Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. While maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy compared to existing approaches, our method significantly excels in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis N. Schneider, Lars Wagner, Daniel Rueckert, Dirk Wilhelm</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate grasping point prediction is a key challenge for autonomous tissue manipulation in minimally invasive surgery, particularly in complex and variable procedures such as colorectal interventions. Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Dhouib, Davide Buscaldi, Sonia Vanier, Aymen Shabou</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting tampered text in document images is a challenging task due to data scarcity. To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Legouhy, Cosimo Campo, Ross Callaghan, Hojjat Azadbakht, Hui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we present Polaffini, a robust and versatile framework for anatomically grounded registration. Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring tree crop expansion is vital for zero-deforestation policies like the European Union's Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EUDR). However, these efforts are hindered by a lack of highresolution data distinguishing diverse agricultural systems from forests. Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as "forest". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhun Kim, Martin Mayr, Thomas Gorges, Fei Wu, Mathias Seuret, Andreas Maier, Vincent Christlein</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems commonly use Transformers, whose growing key-value (KV) cache makes decoding slow and memory-intensive. We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Caselli, Marco Mistretta, Simone Magistri, Andrew D. Bagdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panagiotis Koletsis, Vasilis Efthymiou, Maria Vakalopoulou, Nikos Komodakis, Anastasios Doulamis, Georgios Th. Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, significant advances in computer vision have also propelled progress in remote sensing. Concurrently, the use of drones has expanded, with many organizations incorporating them into their operations. Most drones are equipped by default with RGB cameras, which are both robust and among the easiest sensors to use and interpret. The body of literature on optical remote sensing is vast, encompassing diverse tasks, capabilities, and methodologies. Each task or methodology could warrant a dedicated survey. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of the field, while also presenting key information, such as datasets and insights. It aims to serve as a guide for researchers entering the field, offering high-level insights and helping them focus on areas most relevant to their interests. To the best of our knowledge, no existing survey addresses this holistic perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomeng Peng, Xilang Huang, Seon Han Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is important for smart manufacturing, but many deep learning approaches produce only binary decisions and provide limited semantic explanations. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwei Shan, Zeyu Cai, Cheng-Tai Hsieh, Yirui Li, Hao Liu, Lijun Han, Hesheng Wang, Shing Shin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing deformable surgical scenes from endoscopic videos is challenging and clinically important. Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs. Code will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/Local-EndoGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan-Bac Nguyen, Hoang-Quan Nguyen, Sankalp Pandey, Tim Faltermeier, Nicholas Borys, Hugh Churchill, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing two-dimensional quantum materials from optical microscopy images is challenging due to the subtle layer-dependent contrast, limited labeled data, and significant variation across laboratories and imaging setups. Existing vision models struggle in this domain since they lack physical priors and cannot generalize to new materials or hardware conditions. This work presents a new physics-aware multimodal framework that addresses these limitations from both the data and model perspectives. We first present Synthia, a physics-based synthetic data generator that simulates realistic optical responses of quantum material flakes under thin-film interference. Synthia produces diverse and high-quality samples, helping reduce the dependence on expert manual annotation. We introduce QMat-Instruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset for quantum materials, comprising multimodal, physics-informed question-answer pairs designed to teach Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to understand the appearance and thickness of flakes. Then, we propose Physics-Aware Instruction Tuning (QuPAINT), a multimodal architecture that incorporates a Physics-Informed Attention module to fuse visual embeddings with optical priors, enabling more robust and discriminative flake representations. Finally, we establish QF-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple materials, substrates, and imaging settings, offering standardized protocols for fair and reproducible evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Lu, Siwei Nie, Minlong Lu, Xudong Yang, Xiaobo Zhang, Peng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Copy Detection (ICD) aims to identify manipulated content between image pairs through robust feature representation learning. While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning. We address this limitation by exploiting the inherent geometric traceability in edited content through two key innovations. First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Augmented reality can improve tumor localization in laparoscopic liver surgery. Existing registration pipelines typically depend on organ contours; deformable (non-rigid) alignment is often handled with finite-element (FE) models coupled to dimensionality-reduction or machine-learning components. We integrate laparoscopic depth maps with a foundation pose estimator for camera-liver pose estimation and replace FE-based deformation with non-rigid iterative closest point (NICP) to lower engineering/modeling complexity and expertise requirements. On real patient data, the depth-augmented foundation pose approach achieved 9.91 mm mean registration error in 3 cases. Combined rigid-NICP registration outperformed rigid-only registration, demonstrating NICP as an efficient substitute for finite-element deformable models. This pipeline achieves clinically relevant accuracy while offering a lightweight, engineering-friendly alternative to FE-based deformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behzad Bozorgtabar, Dwarikanath Mahapatra, Sudipta Roy, Muzammal Naseer, Imran Razzak, Zongyuan Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) are strong zero-shot recognizers for medical imaging, but their reliability under domain shift hinges on calibrated uncertainty with guarantees. Split conformal prediction (SCP) offers finite-sample coverage, yet prediction sets often become large (low efficiency) and class-wise coverage unbalanced-high class-conditioned coverage gap (CCV), especially in few-shot, imbalanced regimes; moreover, naively adapting to calibration labels breaks exchangeability and voids guarantees. We propose \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once. Across \textbf{three} medical VLMs and \textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute. Comprehensive ablations and qualitative analyses show that \texttt{\textbf{LATA}} sharpens zero-shot predictions without compromising exchangeability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixu Cheng, Da Li, Jian Hu, Ziquan Liu, Wei Li, Shaogang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiucheng Wu, Jing Shi, Simon Jenni, Kushal Kafle, Tianyu Wang, Shiyu Chang, Handong Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential for extending vision-language reasoning to professional tool-based image editing, enabling intuitive and creative editing. A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Rinaldi, Matteo Mendula, Nicola Fanelli, Florence Lev\'e, Matteo Testi, Giovanna Castellano, Gennaro Vessio</p>
<p>Abstract: Music generation has advanced markedly through multimodal deep learning, enabling models to synthesize audio from text and, more recently, from images. However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jowaria Khan, Anindya Sarkar, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world settings, such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, or public health, with costly and difficult data collection and dynamic environments, strategically sampling from unobserved regions is essential for efficiently uncovering hidden targets under tight resource constraints. Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyoung Kim, Youngjin Shin, Siyoon Jin, Dahyun Chung, Jisu Nam, Tongmin Kim, Jongjae Park, Hyeonwoo Kang, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for Virtual Try-On (VTON) often struggle to preserve fine garment details, especially in unpaired settings where accurate person-garment correspondence is required. These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pourya Shamsolmoali, Masoumeh Zareapoor, Eric Granger, Yue Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving user-specified objects from complex scenes remains a challenging task, especially when queries are ambiguous or involve multiple similar objects. Existing open-vocabulary detectors operate in a one-shot manner, lacking the ability to refine predictions based on user feedback. To address this, we propose IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions based on user feedback. At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision. On LVIS, IntRec achieves 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE by +2.3, +3.7, and +0.5, respectively. On the challenging LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark, it improves performance by +7.9 AP over its one-shot baseline after a single corrective feedback, with less than 30 ms of added latency per interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tyler Bonnen, Jitendra Malik, Angjoo Kanazawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can infer the three-dimensional structure of objects from two-dimensional visual inputs. Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Fang, Yuchun Feng, Dong Jing, Jiaqi Liu, Yue Yang, Zhenyu Wei, Daniel Szafir, Mingyu Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\pi_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has enabled agents that can interpret imagery, connect it with language, and perform structured analytical tasks. Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sub-bit model compression seeks storage below one bit per weight; as magnitudes are aggressively compressed, the sign bit becomes a fixed-cost bottleneck. Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Burde, Pavel Burget, Torsten Sattler</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots.</p>

By linking the encoder's output noise to the prior's minimum noise level, we obtain a simple training objective that provides a tight upper bound on the latent bitrate. On ImageNet-512, our approach achieves competitive FID of 1.4, with high reconstruction quality (PSNR) while requiring fewer training FLOPs than models trained on Stable Diffusion latents.

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the application of the common circle method for estimating sample motion in optical diffraction tomography (ODT) of sub-millimeter sized biological tissue. When samples are confined via contact-free acoustical force fields, their motion must be estimated from the captured images. The common circle method identifies intersections of Ewald spheres in Fourier space to determine rotational motion. This paper presents a practical implementation, incorporating temporal consistency constraints to achieve stable reconstructions. Our results on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the common circle method provides a computationally efficient alternative to full optimization methods for motion detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithin Sugavanam, Emre Ertin</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minheng Chen, Jing Zhang, Tong Chen, Chao Cao, Tianming Liu, Li Su, Dajiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.</p>

Artificial intelligence and robotics solutions could facilitate their operations, compensating these difficulties. To this end, we propose a dataset for gesture-based UGV control by FRs, introducing a set of 12 commands, drawing inspiration from existing gestures used by FRs and tactical hand signals and refined after incorporating feedback from experienced FRs. Then we proceed with the data collection itself, resulting in 3312 RGBD pairs captured from 2 viewpoints and 7 distances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset especially intended for gesture-based UGV guidance by FRs. Finally we define evaluation protocols for our RGBD dataset, termed FR-GESTURE, and we perform baseline experiments, which are put forward for improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Zhao, Zhaoyi Li, Yaxin Luo, Jiacheng Cui, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are challenging due to missing gradients and complex multimodal boundaries. While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wang, Yu-Ping Wang, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised algorithm named MotionHint for monocular visual odometry (VO) that takes motion constraints into account. A key aspect of our approach is to use an appropriate motion model that can help existing self-supervised monocular VO (SSM-VO) algorithms to overcome issues related to the local minima within their self-supervised loss functions. The motion model is expressed with a neural network named PPnet. It is trained to coarsely predict the next pose of the camera and the uncertainty of this prediction. Our self-supervised approach combines the original loss and the motion loss, which is the weighted difference between the prediction and the generated ego-motion. Taking two existing SSM-VO systems as our baseline, we evaluate our MotionHint algorithm on the standard KITTI benchmark. Experimental results show that our MotionHint algorithm can be easily applied to existing open-sourced state-of-the-art SSM-VO systems to greatly improve the performance by reducing the resulting ATE by up to 28.73%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wang, Di Kang, Yan-Pei Cao, Linchao Bao, Ying Shan, Song-Hai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rendering photorealistic and dynamically moving human heads is crucial for ensuring a pleasant and immersive experience in AR/VR and video conferencing applications. However, existing methods often struggle to model challenging facial regions (e.g., mouth interior, eyes, hair/beard), resulting in unrealistic and blurry results. In this paper, we propose {\fullname} ({\name}), a method that adopts the neural point representation as well as the neural volume rendering process and discards the predefined connectivity and hard correspondence imposed by mesh-based approaches. Specifically, the neural points are strategically constrained around the surface of the target expression via a high-resolution UV displacement map, achieving increased modeling capacity and more accurate control. We introduce three technical innovations to improve the rendering and training efficiency: a patch-wise depth-guided (shading point) sampling strategy, a lightweight radiance decoding process, and a Grid-Error-Patch (GEP) ray sampling strategy during training. By design, our {\name} is better equipped to handle topologically changing regions and thin structures while also ensuring accurate expression control when animating avatars. Experiments conducted on three subjects from the Multiface dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods, especially in handling challenging facial regions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel method, LoLep, which regresses Locally-Learned planes from a single RGB image to represent scenes accurately, thus generating better novel views. Without the depth information, regressing appropriate plane locations is a challenging problem. To solve this issue, we pre-partition the disparity space into bins and design a disparity sampler to regress local offsets for multiple planes in each bin. However, only using such a sampler makes the network not convergent; we further propose two optimizing strategies that combine with different disparity distributions of datasets and propose an occlusion-aware reprojection loss as a simple yet effective geometric supervision technique. We also introduce a self-attention mechanism to improve occlusion inference and present a Block-Sampling Self-Attention (BS-SA) module to address the problem of applying self-attention to large feature maps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and generate state-of-the-art results on different datasets. Compared to MINE, our approach has an LPIPS reduction of 4.8%-9.0% and an RV reduction of 73.9%-83.5%. We also evaluate the performance on real-world images and demonstrate the benefits.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creating high-fidelity head avatars from multi-view videos is a core issue for many AR/VR applications. However, existing methods usually struggle to obtain high-quality renderings for all different head components simultaneously since they use one single representation to model components with drastically different characteristics (e.g., skin vs. hair). In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar (MeGA) that models different head components with more suitable representations. Specifically, we select an enhanced FLAME mesh as our facial representation and predict a UV displacement map to provide per-vertex offsets for improved personalized geometric details. To achieve photorealistic renderings, we obtain facial colors using deferred neural rendering and disentangle neural textures into three meaningful parts. For hair modeling, we first build a static canonical hair using 3D Gaussian Splatting. A rigid transformation and an MLP-based deformation field are further applied to handle complex dynamic expressions. Combined with our occlusion-aware blending, MeGA generates higher-fidelity renderings for the whole head and naturally supports more downstream tasks. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and supporting various editing functionalities, including hairstyle alteration and texture editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Guo, Yitai Cheng, Meihui Wang, Ilya Ilyankou, Natchapon Jongwiriyanurak, Xiaowei Gao, Nicola Christie, James Haworth</p>
<p>Abstract: Cyclists face a disproportionate risk of injury, yet conventional crash records are too sparse to identify risk factors at fine spatial and temporal scales. Recently, naturalistic studies have used video data to capture the complex behavioural and infrastructural risk factors. A promising format is panoramic video, which can record 360$^\circ$ views around a rider. However, its use is limited by distortions, large numbers of small objects, and boundary continuity, which cannot be handled using existing computer vision models. This research proposes a novel three-step framework: (1) enhancing object detection accuracy on panoramic imagery by segmenting and projecting the original 360$^\circ$ images into sub-images; (2) modifying multi-object tracking models to incorporate boundary continuity and object category information; and (3) validating through a real-world application of vehicle overtaking detection. The methodology is evaluated using panoramic videos recorded by cyclists on London's roadways under diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements over baselines, achieving higher average precision across varying image resolutions. Moreover, the enhanced tracking approach yields a 10.0% decrease in identification switches and a 2.7% improvement in identification precision. The overtaking detection task achieves a high F-score of 0.82, illustrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world cycling safety scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Foundation Models like Dust3r can produce high quality outputs such as pointmaps, camera intrinsics, and depth estimation, given stereo-image pairs as input. However, the application of these outputs on tasks like Visual Localization requires a large amount of inference time and compute resources. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the use of a knowledge distillation pipeline, where we aim to build a student-teacher model with Dust3r as the teacher and explore multiple architectures of student models that are trained using the 3D reconstructed points output by Dust3r. Our goal is to build student models that can learn scene-specific representations and output 3D points with replicable performance such as Dust3r. The data set we used to train our models is 12Scenes. We test two main architectures of models: a CNN-based architecture and a Vision Transformer based architecture. For each architecture, we also compare the use of pre-trained models against models built from scratch. We qualitatively compare the reconstructed 3D points output by the student model against Dust3r's and discuss the various features learned by the student model. We also perform ablation studies on the models through hyperparameter tuning. Overall, we observe that the Vision Transformer presents the best performance visually and quantitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> S\'ebastien Quetin, Tapotosh Ghosh, Farhad Maleki</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning methods in self-supervised settings have primarily focused on pre-training encoders, while decoders are typically introduced and trained separately for downstream dense prediction tasks. However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting a contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction, DeCon establishes consistent state-of-the-art performance on most of the evaluated tasks when pre-trained on Imagenet-1K, COCO and COCO+. Notably, when pre-training a ResNet-50 encoder on COCO dataset, DeCon improves COCO object detection and instance segmentation compared to the baseline framework by +0.37 AP and +0.32 AP, respectively, and boosts semantic segmentation by +1.42 mIoU on Pascal VOC and by +0.50 mIoU on Cityscapes. These improvements generalize across recent backbones, decoders, datasets, and dense tasks beyond segmentation and object detection, and persist in out-of-domain scenarios, including limited-data settings, demonstrating that joint pre-training significantly enhances representation quality for dense prediction.

<p>Abstract: AI models have made significant strides in recent years in their ability to describe and answer questions about real-world images. They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.</p>

<p>Abstract: The scalability of current language-image pre-training for 3D medical imaging, such as CT and MRI, is constrained by the need for radiologists to manually curate raw clinical studies. In this work, we pioneer pre-training directly on uncurated studies, which both aligns more closely with the radiologist's workflow and provides a natural path to scalability. However, the unique structure of such data presents new challenges for existing model architectures, which were originally designed for 2D slices or single 3D scans. To address this, we introduce a novel hierarchical attention mechanism inspired by the intrinsic hierarchy of radiology data: slice, scan, and study. We denote our framework as Hierarchical attention for Language-Image Pre-training (HLIP). Trained on 220K studies with 3.13 million scans for brain MRI and 240K studies with 1.44 million scans for head CT, HLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., +10.5% balanced ACC on the proposed publicly available brain MRI benchmark Pub-Brain-5; +8.3% and +1.7% macro AUC on head CT benchmarks CQ500 and RSNA, respectively. HLIP also exhibits strong generalizability on existing 3D medical language-image pre-training benchmarks, e.g., +4.3% macro AUC on the Rad-ChestCT benchmark when pre-trained on CT-RATE. These results demonstrate that, with HLIP, directly pre-training on uncurated clinical datasets is a scalable and effective direction for language-image pre-training in 3D medical imaging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Zhao, Zixuan Wang, Tianyu Luan, Jia Jia, Wentao Zhu, Jiebo Luo, Junsong Yuan, Nan Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film, sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion, a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of motion fidelity than previous work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Zhu, Honghua Chen, Peng Li, Mingqiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained 2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment, we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality, 3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoxu Huang, Mingqi Gao, Jungong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or 3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective. This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Farahbakhsh, Vishnu Teja Kunde, Dileep Kalathil, Krishna Narayanan, Jean-Francois Chamberland</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using side information. Our framework can be added to existing diffusion-based reconstruction pipelines in a plug-and-play manner, without requiring any training. Through extensive experiments across a range of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and several deblurring tasks, and across multiple diffusion-based inverse problem solvers (DPS, DAPS, and MPGD), we show that augmenting each solver with our framework consistently improves the quality of the reconstructions over the corresponding original method. In order to demonstrate the generality of our approach, we consider diverse forms of side information, including reference images, textual descriptions, and anatomical MRI scans. We also show that our search-based approach outperforms other ways of incorporating side information, including reward gradient-based method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasaman Haghighi, Bastien van Delft, Mariam Hassan, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius Dubosc, Yann Fischer, Zacharie Auray, Nicolas Boutry, Edwin Carlinet, Michael Atlan, Thierry Geraud</p>
<p>Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

<p>Abstract: Many ecological questions center on complex phenomena, such as species interactions, behaviors, phenology, and responses to disturbance, that are inherently difficult to observe and sparsely documented. Community science platforms such as iNaturalist contain hundreds of millions of biodiversity images, which often contain evidence of these complex phenomena. However, current workflows that seek to discover and analyze this evidence often rely on manual inspection, leaving this information largely inaccessible at scale. We introduce INQUIRE-Search, an open-source system that uses natural language to enable scientists to rapidly search within an ecological image database like iNaturalist for specific phenomena, verify and export relevant observations, and use these outputs for downstream scientific analysis. Across five illustrative case studies, INQUIRE-Search concentrates relevant observations 3-25x more efficiently than comparable manual inspection budgets. These examples demonstrate how the system can be used for ecological inference, from analyzing seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires. These examples illustrate a new paradigm for interactive, efficient, and scalable scientific discovery that can begin to unlock previously inaccessible scientific value in large-scale biodiversity datasets. Finally, we highlight how AI-enabled discovery tools for science require reframing aspects of the scientific process, including experiment design, data collection, survey effort, and uncertainty analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Li, Yiqing Wang, Sina Farsiu, Paul Kinahan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilan Zhang, Li Nanbo, Changchun Yang, J\"urgen Schmidhuber, Xin Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of histology images and gene profiles has shown great promise for improving survival prediction in cancer. However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Banks, Camila Lindoni Azevedo, Hongying Tang, Yunpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mozes Jacobs, Thomas Fel, Richard Hakim, Alessandra Brondetta, Demba Ba, T. Andy Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxwell Jones, Rameen Abdal, Or Patashnik, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Sergey Tulyakov, Jun-Yan Zhu, Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wooseok Jeon, Seunghyun Shin, Dongmin Shin, Hae-Gon Jeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarong Liang, Max Ku, Ka-Hei Hui, Ping Nie, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad J. Alahmadi, Peng Gao, Feiyi Wang, Dongkuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration--Exploitation Distillation (E$^2$D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E$^2$D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being $18\times$ faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining $4.3\times$ faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amal Lahchim, Lambros Athanasiou</p>
<p>Abstract: Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of coronary vessel anatomy but presents challenges due to noise, imaging artifacts, and complex tissue structures. This paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for vessel segmentation and classification in OCT images using machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates image preprocessing, guidewire artifact removal, polar-to-Cartesian transformation, unsupervised K-means clustering, and local feature extraction. These features are used to train Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers for pixel-wise vessel classification. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1-score values up to 1.00 and overall classification accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed approach provides accurate vessel boundary detection while maintaining low computational complexity and requiring minimal manual annotation. This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi He, XiangXiang Wang, Jingtao Zhang, Yongbin Yu, Hongxiang Chu, Manping Fan, JingYe Cai, Zhenglin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability. To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales. Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Murat Onur Yildirim, Elif Ceren Gok Yildirim, Joaquin Vanschoren</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning requires models to integrate new classes or domains over time while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Within this paradigm, foundation models often achieve strong performance, but they still remain subject to the stability-plasticity trade-off, where excessive plasticity leads to forgetting of prior knowledge, and excessive stability constrains the adaptation. This necessitates an effective post-training strategy that introduces minimal yet functional modifications. To address this challenge, we first introduce a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning module 'Learn and Calibrate', or LuCA, designed to acquire task-specific knowledge through an adapter-calibrator couple, enabling well-refined feature representations. Then, for each task, we deploy a sparse LuCA module on top of the last classification token [CLS] just before the classifier, which we refer to as 'Token-level Sparse Calibration and Adaptation', or TOSCA. By leaving the generalization capabilities of the foundation models intact and adapting exclusively via the last token, our approach achieves a harmonious balance between stability and plasticity while reducing both training and inference complexity. We demonstrate that TOSCA yields state-of-the-art performance while introducing ~8 times fewer parameters compared to prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Qiao, Yingjia Wang, Xing Liu, Sixing Wu, Jianbin Li, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Papi, Maike Z\"ufle, Marco Gaido, Beatrice Savoldi, Danni Liu, Ioannis Douros, Luisa Bentivogli, Jan Niehues</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have laid the foundation for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which unify text, speech, and vision within a single framework. As these models are rapidly evolving toward general-purpose instruction following across diverse and complex tasks, a key frontier is evaluating their crosslingual and multimodal capabilities over both short- and long-form inputs. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on a single modality at a time, rely on short-form inputs, or lack human annotations--hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first crosslingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks on NLP and beyond. MCIF evaluates instruction following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over different input lengths and spans four macro-tasks: recognition, translation, question answering, and summarization. It covers three core modalities (speech, vision, and text) and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), fully aligned across all dimensions. This parallel design enables a systematic evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and effectively integrate multimodal contextual information. Our benchmarking and analysis of 23 models highlight universal challenges across modalities and tasks, indicating substantial room for improvement in future MLLMs development. MCIF is released under CC-BY 4.0 license to promote open research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David A Kelly, Hana Chockler</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that frequently lack formal rigour. On the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal explanations and their equivalence to logic-based explanations. We demonstrate how to subdivide an image into its sufficient and necessary components. We introduce $\delta$-complete explanations, which have a minimum confidence threshold and 1-complete causal explanations, explanations that are classified with the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that different models have different patterns of sufficiency, necessity, and completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s per image on a ResNet model to compute all types of explanations, and are totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as monotonicity, of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Szymon Pawlonka, Miko{\l}aj Ma{\l}ki\'nski, Jacek Ma\'ndziuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction, however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM) pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations, including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansheng Chen, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Leonidas Guibas, Gordon Wetzstein, Sai Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming previous 1-NFE models of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art DMD models, while maintaining teacher-level quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, comprising tissue detection followed by patch extraction, is foundational to AI-driven computational pathology but remains a major bottleneck for scaling to large and heterogeneous cohorts. We present AtlasPatch, a scalable framework that couples foundation-model tissue detection with high-throughput patch extraction at minimal computational overhead. Our tissue detector achieves high precision (0.986) and remains robust across varying tissue conditions (e.g., brightness, fragmentation, boundary definition, tissue heterogeneity) and common artifacts (e.g., pen/ink markings, scanner streaks). This robustness is enabled by our annotated, heterogeneous multi-cohort training set of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails combined with efficient adaptation of the Segment-Anything (SAM) model. AtlasPatch also reduces end-to-end WSI preprocessing time by up to 16$\times$ versus widely used deep-learning pipelines, without degrading downstream task performance. The AtlasPatch tool is open-source, efficiently parallelized for practical deployment, and supports options to save extracted patches or stream them into common feature-extraction models for on-the-fly embedding, making it adaptable to both pathology departments (tissue detection and quality control) and AI researchers (dataset creation and model training).

<p>Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.</p>

We present MTL-VQA, a multi-task learning framework that uses full-reference metrics as supervisory signals to learn perceptually meaningful features without human labels for pretraining. By jointly optimizing multiple full-reference (FR) objectives with adaptive task weighting, our approach learns shared representations that transfer effectively to NR-VQA. Experiments on gaming video datasets show MTL-VQA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art NR-VQA methods across both MOS-supervised and label-efficient/self-supervised settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Jimenez-Navarro, Belen Masia, Ana Serrano</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans can infer material characteristics of objects from their visual appearance, and this ability extends to artistic depictions, where similar perceptual strategies guide the interpretation of paintings or drawings. Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.</p>
