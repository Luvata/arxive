<p><b>Authors:</b> Tevfik Uyar</p>
<p>Abstract: As Artificial General Intelligence edges closer to reality, Artificial Superintelligence does too. This paper argues that ASI's unparalleled capabilities might lead people to attribute godlike infallibility to it, resulting in a cognitive bias toward unquestioning acceptance of its decisions. By drawing parallels between ASI and divine attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, this analysis highlights the risks of conflating technological advancement with moral and ethical superiority. Such dynamics could engender a technocratic theocracy, where decision-making is abdicated to ASI, undermining human agency and critical thinking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Martin, Tuomas Sandholm</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning at execution time has been shown to dramatically improve performance for agents in both single-agent and multi-agent settings. A well-known family of approaches to planning at execution time are AlphaZero and its variants, which use Monte Carlo Tree Search together with a neural network that guides the search by predicting state values and action probabilities. AlphaZero trains these networks by minimizing a planning loss that makes the value prediction match the episode return, and the policy prediction at the root of the search tree match the output of the full tree expansion. AlphaZero has been applied to both single-agent environments (such as Sokoban) and multi-agent environments (such as chess and Go) with great success. In this paper, we explore an intriguing question: In single-agent environments, can we outperform AlphaZero by directly maximizing the episode score instead of minimizing this planning loss, while leaving the MCTS algorithm and neural architecture unchanged? To directly maximize the episode score, we use evolution strategies, a family of algorithms for zeroth-order blackbox optimization. Our experiments indicate that, across multiple environments, directly maximizing the episode score outperforms minimizing the planning loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang-il Lee, Minbeom Kim, Seunghyun Yoon, Minsung Kim, Dongryeol Lee, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various multimodal tasks. However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinrui Yang, Zhuohan Wang, Anthony Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiying Hu, Zengrong Huang, Chengpeng Hu, Jialin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, procedural content generation has exhibited considerable advancements in the domain of 2D game level generation such as Super Mario Bros. and Sokoban through large language models (LLMs). To further validate the capabilities of LLMs, this paper explores how LLMs contribute to the generation of 3D buildings in a sandbox game, Minecraft. We propose a Text to Building in Minecraft (T2BM) model, which involves refining prompts, decoding interlayer representation and repairing. Facade, indoor scene and functional blocks like doors are supported in the generation. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the completeness and satisfaction of buildings generated via LLMs. It shows that LLMs hold significant potential for 3D building generation. Given appropriate prompts, LLMs can generate correct buildings in Minecraft with complete structures and incorporate specific building blocks such as windows and beds, meeting the specified requirements of human users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Richoux</p>
<p>Abstract: Games, including abstract board games, constitute a convenient ground to create, design, and improve new AI methods. In this field, Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular algorithm family, aiming to build game trees and explore them efficiently. Combinatorial Optimization, on the other hand, aims to model and solve problems with an objective to optimize and constraints to satisfy, and is less common in Game AI. We believe however that both methods can be combined efficiently, by injecting Combinatorial Optimization into Monte Carlo Tree Search to help the tree search, leading to a novel combination of these two techniques. Tested on the board game boop., our method beats 96% of the time the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm baseline. We conducted an ablation study to isolate and analyze which injections and combinations of injections lead to such performances. Finally, we opposed our AI method against human players on the Board Game Arena platform, and reached a 373 ELO rating after 51 boop. games, with a 69% win rate and finishing ranked 56th worldwide on the platform over 5,316 boop. players.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sania Sinha, Tanawan Premsri, Parisa Kordjamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional learning, mastering the ability to combine basic concepts and construct more intricate ones, is crucial for human cognition, especially in human language comprehension and visual perception. This notion is tightly connected to generalization over unobserved situations. Despite its integral role in intelligence, there is a lack of systematic theoretical and experimental research methodologies, making it difficult to analyze the compositional learning abilities of computational models. In this paper, we survey the literature on compositional learning of AI models and the connections made to cognitive studies. We identify abstract concepts of compositionality in cognitive and linguistic studies and connect these to the computational challenges faced by language and vision models in compositional reasoning. We overview the formal definitions, tasks, evaluation benchmarks, variety of computational models, and theoretical findings. We cover modern studies on large language models to provide a deeper understanding of the cutting-edge compositional capabilities exhibited by state-of-the-art AI models and pinpoint important directions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Along with the development of chatbot, language models and speech technologies, there is a growing possibility and interest of creating systems able to interface with humans seamlessly through natural language or directly via speech. In this paper, we want to demonstrate that placing the research on dialog system in the broader context of embodied intelligence allows to introduce concepts taken from neurobiology and neuropsychology to define behavior architecture that reconcile hand-crafted design and artificial neural network and open the gate to future new learning approaches like imitation or learning by instruction. To do so, this paper presents a neural behavior engine that allows creation of mixed initiative dialog and action generation based on hand-crafted models using a graphical language. A demonstration of the usability of such brain-like inspired architecture together with a graphical dialog model is described through a virtual receptionist application running on a semi-public space.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09143">Generative AI-based Prompt Evolution Engineering Design Optimization With Vision-Language Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Melvin Wong, Thiago Rios, Stefan Menzel, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Engineering design optimization requires an efficient combination of a 3D shape representation, an optimization algorithm, and a design performance evaluation method, which is often computationally expensive. We present a prompt evolution design optimization (PEDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model for penalizing impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolutionary search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20\% in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization performance while providing ease of use in specifying design specifications and preferences via a natural language interface.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luiza Pellin Biasoto, Vinicius Renan de Carvalho, Jaime Sim\~ao Sichman</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the Production Routing Problem with Privacy Preserving (PRPPP) in supply chain optimization. The integrated optimization of production, inventory, distribution, and routing decisions in real-world industry applications poses several challenges, including increased complexity, discrepancies between planning and execution, and constraints on information sharing. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes the use of intelligent agent negotiation within a hybrid Multi-Agent System (MAS) integrated with optimization algorithms. The MAS facilitates communication and coordination among entities, encapsulates private information, and enables negotiation. This, along with optimization algorithms, makes it a compelling framework for establishing optimal solutions. The approach is supported by real-world applications and synergies between MAS and optimization methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing complex supply chain optimization problems.</p>

This paper describes work on an initial dataset that we have built to make progress towards such an understanding: 268,386 plays among 61 different agents across 1494 distinct games. We describe a preliminary analysis and work on training predictive models on this dataset, as well as lessons learned and future plans for a new and improved version of the dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuolin Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we show how Transformers can be interpreted as dense Expectation-Maximization algorithms performed on Bayesian Nets. Based on the above interpretation, we propose a new model design paradigm, namely Vertical LoRA (VLoRA), which reduces the parameter count dramatically while preserving performance. In VLoRA, a model consists of layers, each of which recursively learns an increment based on the previous layer. We then apply LoRA decomposition to the increments. VLoRA works on the base model, which is orthogonal to LoRA, meaning they can be used together. We do experiments on various tasks and models. The results show that 1) with VLoRA, the Transformer model parameter count can be reduced dramatically and 2) the performance of the original model is preserved.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Polo-Molina, David Alfaya, Jose Portela</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in large-scale datasets. However, their black-box nature poses ethical challenges. In certain situations, ensuring ethical predictions might require following specific partial monotonic constraints. However, certifying if an already-trained ANN is partially monotonic is challenging. Therefore, ANNs are often disregarded in some critical applications, such as credit scoring, where partial monotonicity is required. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel algorithm (LipVor) that certifies if a black-box model, such as an ANN, is positive based on a finite number of evaluations. Therefore, as partial monotonicity can be stated as a positivity condition of the partial derivatives, the LipVor Algorithm can certify whether an already trained ANN is partially monotonic. To do so, for every positively evaluated point, the Lipschitzianity of the black-box model is used to construct a specific neighborhood where the function remains positive. Next, based on the Voronoi diagram of the evaluated points, a sufficient condition is stated to certify if the function is positive in the domain. Compared to prior methods, our approach is able to mathematically certify if an ANN is partially monotonic without needing constrained ANN's architectures or piece-wise linear activation functions. Therefore, LipVor could open up the possibility of using unconstrained ANN in some critical fields. Moreover, some other properties of an ANN, such as convexity, can be posed as positivity conditions, and therefore, LipVor could also be applied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangjing Huang, Qiong Wu, Jingyi Li, Xu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that enables clients to collaboratively train a shared global model without uploading their local data. To alleviate the heterogeneous data quality among clients, artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) can be leveraged as a novel data synthesis technique for FL model performance enhancement. Due to various costs incurred by AIGC-empowered FL (e.g., costs of local model computation and data synthesis), however, clients are usually reluctant to participate in FL without adequate economic incentives, which leads to an unexplored critical issue for enabling AIGC-empowered FL. To fill this gap, we first devise a data quality assessment method for data samples generated by AIGC and rigorously analyze the convergence performance of FL model trained using a blend of authentic and AI-generated data samples. We then propose a data quality-aware incentive mechanism to encourage clients' participation. In light of information asymmetry incurred by clients' private multi-dimensional attributes, we investigate clients' behavior patterns and derive the server's optimal incentive strategies to minimize server's cost in terms of both model accuracy loss and incentive payments for both complete and incomplete information scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism exhibits highest training accuracy and reduces up to 53.34% of the server's cost with real-world datasets, compared with existing benchmark mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyun Nam, Kyuyoung Kim, Seunghyuk Oh, Jihoon Tack, Jaehyung Kim, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning effective representations from raw data is crucial for the success of deep learning methods. However, in the tabular domain, practitioners often prefer augmenting raw column features over using learned representations, as conventional tree-based algorithms frequently outperform competing approaches. As a result, feature engineering methods that automatically generate candidate features have been widely used. While these approaches are often effective, there remains ambiguity in defining the space over which to search for candidate features. Moreover, they often rely solely on validation scores to select good features, neglecting valuable feedback from past experiments that could inform the planning of future experiments. To address the shortcomings, we propose a new tabular learning framework based on large language models (LLMs), coined Optimizing Column feature generator with decision Tree reasoning (OCTree). Our key idea is to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities to find good feature generation rules without manually specifying the search space and provide language-based reasoning information highlighting past experiments as feedback for iterative rule improvements. Here, we choose a decision tree as reasoning as it can be interpreted in natural language, effectively conveying knowledge of past experiments (i.e., the prediction models trained with the generated features) to the LLM. Our empirical results demonstrate that this simple framework consistently enhances the performance of various prediction models across diverse tabular benchmarks, outperforming competing automatic feature engineering methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Mahfuzur Rahman, Md Abrar Jahin, Md. Saiful Islam, M. F. Mridha</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating quay-crane dual-cycling with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising one-dimensional and two-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Statistical validation through a two-tailed paired t-test confirms the superiority of QCDC-DR-GA at a 5% significance level. The approach effectively combines QCDC optimization with dockyard rehandle minimization, optimizing the total unloading-loading time. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance than QCDC-DR-GA. This emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously considering both aspects for optimal resource utilization and overall operational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we study how to build a robotic system that can solve multiple 3D manipulation tasks given language instructions. To be useful in industrial and household domains, such a system should be capable of learning new tasks with few demonstrations and solving them precisely. Prior works, like PerAct and RVT, have studied this problem, however, they often struggle with tasks requiring high precision. We study how to make them more effective, precise, and fast. Using a combination of architectural and system-level improvements, we propose RVT-2, a multitask 3D manipulation model that is 6X faster in training and 2X faster in inference than its predecessor RVT. RVT-2 achieves a new state-of-the-art on RLBench, improving the success rate from 65% to 82%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Hassani Shariat Panahi, Amir Hossein Jalilvand, Abolfazl Diyanat</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's world, the Internet is recognized as one of the essentials of human life, playing a significant role in communications, business, and lifestyle. The quality of internet services can have widespread negative impacts on individual and social levels. Consequently, Quality of Service (QoS) has become a fundamental necessity for service providers in a competitive market aiming to offer superior services. The success and survival of these providers depend on their ability to maintain high service quality and ensure satisfaction.Alongside QoS, the concept of Quality of Experience (QoE) has emerged with the development of telephony networks. QoE focuses on the user's satisfaction with the service, helping operators adjust their services to meet user expectations. Recent research shows a trend towards utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict QoE. Researchers aim to develop accurate models by leveraging large volumes of data from network and user interactions, considering various real-world scenarios. Despite the complexity of network environments, this research provides a practical framework for improving and evaluating QoE. This study presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating QoE in multimedia services, adhering to the ITU-T P.1203 standard which includes automated data collection processes and uses machine learning algorithms to predict user satisfaction based on key network parameters. By collecting over 20,000 data records from different network conditions and users, the Random Forest model achieved a prediction accuracy of 95.8% for user satisfaction. This approach allows operators to dynamically allocate network resources in real-time, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction with minimal costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Qi, Ramzi Idoughi, Wolfgang Heidrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow estimation problems are ubiquitous in scientific imaging. Often, the underlying flows are subject to physical constraints that can be exploited in the flow estimation; for example, incompressible (divergence-free) flows are expected for many fluid experiments, while irrotational (curl-free) flows arise in the analysis of optical distortions and wavefront sensing. In this work, we propose a Physics- Inspired Neural Network (PINN) named HDNet, which performs a Helmholtz decomposition of an arbitrary flow field, i.e., it decomposes the input flow into a divergence-only and a curl-only component. HDNet can be trained exclusively on synthetic data generated by reverse Helmholtz decomposition, which we call Helmholtz synthesis. As a PINN, HDNet is fully differentiable and can easily be integrated into arbitrary flow estimation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Brower-Sinning, Grace A. Lewis, Sebast\'ian Echeverr\'ia, Ipek Ozkaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing of machine learning (ML) models is a known challenge identified by researchers and practitioners alike. Unfortunately, current practice for ML model testing prioritizes testing for model performance, while often neglecting the requirements and constraints of the ML-enabled system that integrates the model. This limited view of testing leads to failures during integration, deployment, and operations, contributing to the difficulties of moving models from development to production. This paper presents an approach based on quality attribute (QA) scenarios to elicit and define system- and model-relevant test cases for ML models. The QA-based approach described in this paper has been integrated into MLTE, a process and tool to support ML model test and evaluation. Feedback from users of MLTE highlights its effectiveness in testing beyond model performance and identifying failures early in the development process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computer Science (CS) stands as a testament to the intricacies of human intelligence, profoundly advancing the development of artificial intelligence and modern society. However, the current community of large language models (LLMs) overly focuses on benchmarks for analyzing specific foundational skills (e.g. mathematics and code generation), neglecting an all-round evaluation of the computer science field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first bilingual (Chinese-English) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 5K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields. Looking ahead, we envision CS-Bench serving as a cornerstone for LLM applications in the CS field and paving new avenues in assessing LLMs' diverse reasoning capabilities. The CS-Bench data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/csbench/csbench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Zhao, Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Amanda Cercas Curry</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates robust and challenging benchmarks. Leaderboards like Chatbot Arena rank LLMs based on how well their responses align with human preferences. However, many tasks such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, or persuasiveness, are highly subjective and often lack majoritarian human agreement. Judges may have irreconcilable disagreements about what constitutes a better response. To address the challenge of ranking LLMs on highly subjective tasks, we propose a novel benchmarking framework, the Language Model Council (LMC). The LMC operates through a democratic process to: 1) formulate a test set through equal participation, 2) administer the test among council members, and 3) evaluate responses as a collective jury. We deploy a council of 20 newest LLMs on an open-ended emotional intelligence task: responding to interpersonal dilemmas. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable, robust, and less biased than those from any individual LLM judge, and is more consistent with a human-established leaderboard compared to other benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Cazenavette, Avneesh Sud, Thomas Leung, Ben Usman</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the high potential for abuse of GenAI systems, the task of detecting synthetic images has recently become of great interest to the research community. Unfortunately, existing image-space detectors quickly become obsolete as new high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed at blinding speed. In this work, we propose a new synthetic image detector that uses features obtained by inverting an open-source pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g., DALL-E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups. Moreover, we introduce a new challenging evaluation protocol that uses reverse image search to mitigate stylistic and thematic biases in the detector evaluation. We show that the resulting evaluation scores align well with detectors' in-the-wild performance, and release these datasets as public benchmarks for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilmadhab Das, Vishal Choudhary, V. Vijaya Saradhi, Ashish Anand</p>
<p>Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) is a crucial aspect of computational argumentation, which deals with the identification and extraction of Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most prior works have solved these problems by dividing them into multiple subtasks. And the available end-to-end setups are mostly based on the dependency parsing approach. This work proposes a unified end-to-end framework based on a generative paradigm, in which the argumentative structures are framed into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). Additionally, we explore the role of different types of markers in solving AM tasks. Through different marker-based fine-tuning strategies, we present an extensive study by integrating marker knowledge into our generative model. The proposed framework achieves competitive results to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) model and outperforms several baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabao Ji, Yujian Liu, Yang Zhang, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Rao Kompella, Sijia Liu, Shiyu Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate extensive capability in learning from documents, LLM unlearning becomes an increasingly important research area to address concerns of LLMs in terms of privacy, copyright, etc. A conventional LLM unlearning task typically involves two goals: (1) The target LLM should forget the knowledge in the specified forget documents, and (2) it should retain the other knowledge that the LLM possesses, for which we assume access to a small number of retain documents. To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of two objectives - maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges, degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM's overall capabilities, reducing training time by more than threefold. Notably, our method loses 0% of model utility on the ToFU benchmark, whereas baseline methods may sacrifice 17% of utility on average to achieve comparable forget quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Pilligua, Nil Biescas, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Josep Llad\'os, Ernest Valveny, Sanket Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of intelligent document processing systems demands robust solutions that adapt to diverse domains without extensive retraining. Traditional methods often falter with variable document types, leading to poor performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a text-graphic layer separation approach that enhances domain adaptability in document image restoration (DIR) systems. We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study. Initially trained on a synthetically generated dataset, our model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for the DIR task, offering a promising solution for handling variability in real-world data. Our code is accessible on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: Music evokes emotion in many people. We introduce a novel way to manipulate the emotional content of a song using AI tools. Our goal is to achieve the desired emotion while leaving the original melody as intact as possible. For this, we create an interactive pipeline capable of shifting an input song into a diametrically opposed emotion and visualize this result through Russel's Circumplex model. Our approach is a proof-of-concept for Semantic Manipulation of Music, a novel field aimed at modifying the emotional content of existing music. We design a deep learning model able to assess the accuracy of our modifications to key, SoundFont instrumentation, and other musical features. The accuracy of our model is in-line with the current state of the art techniques on the 4Q Emotion dataset. With further refinement, this research may contribute to on-demand custom music generation, the automated remixing of existing work, and music playlists tuned for emotional progression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech decoding from EEG signals is a challenging task, where brain activity is modeled to estimate salient characteristics of acoustic stimuli. We propose FESDE, a novel framework for Fully-End-to-end Speech Decoding from EEG signals. Our approach aims to directly reconstruct listened speech waveforms given EEG signals, where no intermediate acoustic feature processing step is required. The proposed method consists of an EEG module and a speech module along with a connector. The EEG module learns to better represent EEG signals, while the speech module generates speech waveforms from model representations. The connector learns to bridge the distributions of the latent spaces of EEG and speech. The proposed framework is both simple and efficient, by allowing single-step inference, and outperforms prior works on objective metrics. A fine-grained phoneme analysis is conducted to unveil model characteristics of speech decoding. The source code is available here: github.com/lee-jhwn/fesde.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Negar Kamali, Karyn Nakamura, Angelos Chatzimparmpas, Jessica Hullman, Matthew Groh</p>
<p>Abstract: The high level of photorealism in state-of-the-art diffusion models like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Firefly makes it difficult for untrained humans to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. To address this problem, we designed a guide to help readers develop a more critical eye toward identifying artifacts, inconsistencies, and implausibilities that often appear in AI-generated images. The guide is organized into five categories of artifacts and implausibilities: anatomical, stylistic, functional, violations of physics, and sociocultural. For this guide, we generated 138 images with diffusion models, curated 9 images from social media, and curated 42 real photographs. These images showcase the kinds of cues that prompt suspicion towards the possibility an image is AI-generated and why it is often difficult to draw conclusions about an image's provenance without any context beyond the pixels in an image. Human-perceptible artifacts are not always present in AI-generated images, but this guide reveals artifacts and implausibilities that often emerge. By drawing attention to these kinds of artifacts and implausibilities, we aim to better equip people to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixi Feng, Jiachen Li, Michael Saxon, Tsu-jui Fu, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation has many unique challenges beyond those of image generation. The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this study, we move beyond evaluating simple actions and argue that generated videos should incorporate the emergence of new concepts and their relation transitions like in real-world videos as time progresses. To assess the Temporal Compositionality of video generation models, we propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, corresponding ground truth videos, and robust evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development and simplifying the assessment of transition completion. In addition, by collecting aligned real-world videos corresponding to the prompts, we expand TC-Bench's applicability from text-conditional models to image-conditional ones that can perform generative frame interpolation. We also develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions in generated videos, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal that most video generators achieve less than 20% of the compositional changes, highlighting enormous space for future improvement. Our analysis indicates that current video generation models struggle to interpret descriptions of compositional changes and synthesize various components across different time steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Juan Jos\'e Bucher, Marco Martini</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI offers a simple, prompt-based alternative to fine-tuning smaller BERT-style LLMs for text classification tasks. This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng He, Jicheng Wang, Yuyang Rong, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing is an essential part of modern software engineering to build reliable programs. As testing the software is important but expensive, automatic test case generation methods have become popular in software development. Unlike traditional search-based coverage-guided test generation like fuzzing, neural test generation backed by large language models can write tests that are semantically meaningful and can be understood by other maintainers. However, compared to regular code corpus, unit tests in the datasets are limited in amount and diversity. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation technique **FuzzAug**, that combines the advantages of fuzzing and large language models. FuzzAug not only keeps valid program semantics in the augmented data, but also provides more diverse inputs to the function under test, helping the model to associate correct inputs embedded with the function's dynamic behaviors with the function under test. We evaluate FuzzAug's benefits by using it on a neural test generation dataset to train state-of-the-art code generation models. By augmenting the training set, our model generates test cases with $11\%$ accuracy increases. Models trained with FuzzAug generate unit test functions with double the branch coverage compared to those without it. FuzzAug can be used across various datasets to train advanced code generation models, enhancing their utility in automated software testing. Our work shows the benefits of using dynamic analysis results to enhance neural test generation. Code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burak Var{\i}c{\i}, Dmitriy Katz-Rogozhnikov, Dennis Wei, Prasanna Sattigeri, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal interactions among a group of variables are often modeled by a single causal graph. In some domains, however, these interactions are best described by multiple co-existing causal graphs, e.g., in dynamical systems or genomics. This paper addresses the hitherto unknown role of interventions in learning causal interactions among variables governed by a mixture of causal systems, each modeled by one directed acyclic graph (DAG). Causal discovery from mixtures is fundamentally more challenging than single-DAG causal discovery. Two major difficulties stem from (i) inherent uncertainty about the skeletons of the component DAGs that constitute the mixture and (ii) possibly cyclic relationships across these component DAGs. This paper addresses these challenges and aims to identify edges that exist in at least one component DAG of the mixture, referred to as true edges. First, it establishes matching necessary and sufficient conditions on the size of interventions required to identify the true edges. Next, guided by the necessity results, an adaptive algorithm is designed that learns all true edges using ${\cal O}(n^2)$ interventions, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Remarkably, the size of the interventions is optimal if the underlying mixture model does not contain cycles across its components. More generally, the gap between the intervention size used by the algorithm and the optimal size is quantified. It is shown to be bounded by the cyclic complexity number of the mixture model, defined as the size of the minimal intervention that can break the cycles in the mixture, which is upper bounded by the number of cycles among the ancestors of a node.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality preference datasets are essential for training reward models that can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality responses aligned with human preferences. As LLMs become stronger and better aligned, permissively licensed preference datasets, such as Open Assistant, HH-RLHF, and HelpSteer need to be updated to remain effective for reward modeling. Methods that distil preference data from proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 have restrictions on commercial usage imposed by model providers. To improve upon both generated responses and attribute labeling quality, we release HelpSteer2, a permissively licensed preference dataset (CC-BY-4.0). Using a powerful internal base model trained on HelpSteer2, we are able to achieve the SOTA score (92.0%) on Reward-Bench's primary dataset, outperforming currently listed open and proprietary models, as of June 12th, 2024. Notably, HelpSteer2 consists of only ten thousand response pairs, an order of magnitude fewer than existing preference datasets (e.g., HH-RLHF), which makes it highly efficient for training reward models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that reward models trained with HelpSteer2 are effective in aligning LLMs. In particular, we propose SteerLM 2.0, a model alignment approach that can effectively make use of the rich multi-attribute score predicted by our reward models.

<p>Abstract: The security guarantee of AI-enabled software systems (particularly using deep learning techniques as a functional core) is pivotal against the adversarial attacks exploiting software vulnerabilities. However, little attention has been paid to a systematic investigation of vulnerabilities in such systems. A common situation learned from the open source software community is that deep learning engineers frequently integrate off-the-shelf or open-source learning frameworks into their ecosystems. In this work, we specifically look into deep learning (DL) framework and perform the first systematic study of vulnerabilities in DL systems through a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and open-source DL tools, including TensorFlow, Caffe, OpenCV, Keras, and PyTorch. We propose a two-stream data analysis framework to explore vulnerability patterns from various databases. We investigate the unique DL frameworks and libraries development ecosystems that appear to be decentralized and fragmented. By revisiting the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) List, which provides the traditional software vulnerability related practices, we observed that it is more challenging to detect and fix the vulnerabilities throughout the DL systems lifecycle. Moreover, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,049 DL vulnerabilities to better understand the patterns of vulnerability and the challenges in fixing them. We have released the full replication package at https://github.com/codelzz/Vulnerabilities4DLSystem. We anticipate that our study can advance the development of secure DL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng He, Ethan Wang, Yuyang Rong, Zifei Cheng, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The study and development of AI agents have been boosted by large language models. AI agents can function as intelligent assistants and complete tasks on behalf of their users with access to tools and the ability to execute commands in their environments, Through studying and experiencing the workflow of typical AI agents, we have raised several concerns regarding their security. These potential vulnerabilities are not addressed by the frameworks used to build the agents, nor by research aimed at improving the agents. In this paper, we identify and describe these vulnerabilities in detail from a system security perspective, emphasizing their causes and severe effects. Furthermore, we introduce defense mechanisms corresponding to each vulnerability with meticulous design and experiments to evaluate their viability. Altogether, this paper contextualizes the security issues in the current development of AI agents and delineates methods to make AI agents safer and more reliable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Agro, Quinlan Sykora, Sergio Casas, Thomas Gilles, Raquel Urtasun</p>
<p>Abstract: Perceiving the world and forecasting its future state is a critical task for self-driving. Supervised approaches leverage annotated object labels to learn a model of the world -- traditionally with object detections and trajectory predictions, or temporal bird's-eye-view (BEV) occupancy fields. However, these annotations are expensive and typically limited to a set of predefined categories that do not cover everything we might encounter on the road. Instead, we learn to perceive and forecast a continuous 4D (spatio-temporal) occupancy field with self-supervision from LiDAR data. This unsupervised world model can be easily and effectively transferred to downstream tasks. We tackle point cloud forecasting by adding a lightweight learned renderer and achieve state-of-the-art performance in Argoverse 2, nuScenes, and KITTI. To further showcase its transferability, we fine-tune our model for BEV semantic occupancy forecasting and show that it outperforms the fully supervised state-of-the-art, especially when labeled data is scarce. Finally, when compared to prior state-of-the-art on spatio-temporal geometric occupancy prediction, our 4D world model achieves a much higher recall of objects from classes relevant to self-driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Attrayee Chakraborty, Mandar Karhade</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being adopted across the world and promises a new revolution in healthcare. While AI-enabled medical devices in North America dominate 42.3% of the global market, the use of AI-enabled medical devices in other countries is still a story waiting to be unfolded. We aim to delve deeper into global regulatory approaches towards AI use in healthcare, with a focus on how common themes are emerging globally. We compare these themes to the World Health Organization's (WHO) regulatory considerations and principles on ethical use of AI for healthcare applications. Our work seeks to take a global perspective on AI policy by analyzing 14 legal jurisdictions including countries representative of various regions in the world (North America, South America, South East Asia, Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the Asia-Pacific). Our eventual goal is to foster a global conversation on the ethical use of AI in healthcare and the regulations that will guide it. We propose solutions to promote international harmonization of AI regulations and examine the requirements for regulating generative AI, using China and Singapore as examples of countries with well-developed policies in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinghua Tao, Francesco Tonin, Alex Lambert, Yingyi Chen, Panagiotis Patrinos, Johan A. K. Suykens</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast with Mercer kernel-based approaches as used e.g., in Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), it was previously shown that Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) inherently relates to asymmetric kernels and Asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) has been proposed. However, the existing formulation to KSVD cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiefeng Ma, Yan Wang, Chenyu Liu, Jun Du, Yu Hu, Zhenrong Zhang, Pengfei Hu, Qing Wang, Jianshu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately identifying and organizing textual content is crucial for the automation of document processing in the field of form understanding. Existing datasets, such as FUNSD and XFUND, support entity classification and relationship prediction tasks but are typically limited to local and entity-level annotations. This limitation overlooks the hierarchically structured representation of documents, constraining comprehensive understanding of complex forms. To address this issue, we present the SRFUND, a hierarchically structured multi-task form understanding benchmark. SRFUND provides refined annotations on top of the original FUNSD and XFUND datasets, encompassing five tasks: (1) word to text-line merging, (2) text-line to entity merging, (3) entity category classification, (4) item table localization, and (5) entity-based full-document hierarchical structure recovery. We meticulously supplemented the original dataset with missing annotations at various levels of granularity and added detailed annotations for multi-item table regions within the forms. Additionally, we introduce global hierarchical structure dependencies for entity relation prediction tasks, surpassing traditional local key-value associations. The SRFUND dataset includes eight languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, making it a powerful tool for cross-lingual form understanding. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the SRFUND dataset presents new challenges and significant opportunities in handling diverse layouts and global hierarchical structures of forms, thus providing deep insights into the field of form understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Da Mu, Zhicheng Zhang, Haobo Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) involves detecting and localizing sound events using multichannel sound recordings. Previously proposed Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) has achieved outstanding performance on SELD. However, it still faces challenges in effectively extracting features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. This paper proposes a three-stage network structure named Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module to fully extract multi-scale features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The MFF module utilizes parallel subnetworks architecture to generate multi-scale spectral and spatial features. The TF-Convolution Module is employed to provide multi-scale temporal features. We incorporated MFF into EINV2 and term the proposed method as MFF-EINV2. Experimental results in 2022 and 2023 DCASE challenge task3 datasets show the effectiveness of our MFF-EINV2, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to published methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay Revolinsky, Harry Shomer, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, multiple models proposed for link prediction (LP) demonstrate impressive results on benchmark datasets. However, many popular benchmark datasets often assume that dataset samples are drawn from the same distribution (i.e., IID samples). In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; since uncontrolled factors may lead train and test samples to come from separate distributions. To tackle the distribution shift problem, recent work focuses on creating datasets that feature distribution shifts and designing generalization methods that perform well on the new data. However, those studies only consider distribution shifts that affect {\it node-} and {\it graph-level} tasks, thus ignoring link-level tasks. Furthermore, relatively few LP generalization methods exist. To bridge this gap, we introduce a set of LP-specific data splits which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify the shift's effect empirically through evaluation of different SOTA LP methods and subsequently couple these methods with generalization techniques. Interestingly, LP-specific methods frequently generalize poorly relative to heuristics or basic GNN methods. Finally, this work provides analysis to uncover insights for enhancing LP generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alaleh Ahmadianshalchi, Syrine Belakaria, Janardhan Rao Doppa</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box functions with the goal of discovering high-quality and diverse Pareto fronts where we are allowed to evaluate a batch of inputs. This problem arises in many real-world applications including penicillin production where diversity of solutions is critical. We solve this problem in the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose a novel approach referred to as Pareto front-Diverse Batch Multi-Objective BO (PDBO). PDBO tackles two important challenges: 1) How to automatically select the best acquisition function in each BO iteration, and 2) How to select a diverse batch of inputs by considering multiple objectives. We propose principled solutions to address these two challenges. First, PDBO employs a multi-armed bandit approach to select one acquisition function from a given library. We solve a cheap MOO problem by assigning the selected acquisition function for each expensive objective function to obtain a candidate set of inputs for evaluation. Second, it utilizes Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to choose a Pareto-front-diverse batch of inputs for evaluation from the candidate set obtained from the first step. The key parameters for the methods behind these two steps are updated after each round of function evaluations. Experiments on multiple MOO benchmarks demonstrate that PDBO outperforms prior methods in terms of both the quality and diversity of Pareto solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairui Fu, Shengyu Zhang, Zheqi Lv, Jingyuan Chen, Jiwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the continuously improving capabilities of mobile edges, recommender systems start to deploy models on edges to alleviate network congestion caused by frequent mobile requests. Several studies have leveraged the proximity of edge-side to real-time data, fine-tuning them to create edge-specific models. Despite their significant progress, these methods require substantial on-edge computational resources and frequent network transfers to keep the model up to date. The former may disrupt other processes on the edge to acquire computational resources, while the latter consumes network bandwidth, leading to a decrease in user satisfaction. In response to these challenges, we propose a customizeD slImming framework for incompatiblE neTworks(DIET). DIET deploys the same generic backbone (potentially incompatible for a specific edge) to all devices. To minimize frequent bandwidth usage and storage consumption in personalization, DIET tailors specific subnets for each edge based on its past interactions, learning to generate slimming subnets(diets) within incompatible networks for efficient transfer. It also takes the inter-layer relationships into account, empirically reducing inference time while obtaining more suitable diets. We further explore the repeated modules within networks and propose a more storage-efficient framework, DIETING, which utilizes a single layer of parameters to represent the entire network, achieving comparably excellent performance. The experiments across four state-of-the-art datasets and two widely used models demonstrate the superior accuracy in recommendation and efficiency in transmission and storage of our framework.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08805">A Dual Approach to Imitation Learning from Observations with Offline Datasets</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshit Sikchi, Caleb Chuck, Amy Zhang, Scott Niekum</p>
<p>Abstract: Demonstrations are an effective alternative to task specification for learning agents in settings where designing a reward function is difficult. However, demonstrating expert behavior in the action space of the agent becomes unwieldy when robots have complex, unintuitive morphologies. We consider the practical setting where an agent has a dataset of prior interactions with the environment and is provided with observation-only expert demonstrations. Typical learning from observations approaches have required either learning an inverse dynamics model or a discriminator as intermediate steps of training. Errors in these intermediate one-step models compound during downstream policy learning or deployment. We overcome these limitations by directly learning a multi-step utility function that quantifies how each action impacts the agent's divergence from the expert's visitation distribution. Using the principle of duality, we derive DILO(Dual Imitation Learning from Observations), an algorithm that can leverage arbitrary suboptimal data to learn imitating policies without requiring expert actions. DILO reduces the learning from observations problem to that of simply learning an actor and a critic, bearing similar complexity to vanilla offline RL. This allows DILO to gracefully scale to high dimensional observations, and demonstrate improved performance across the board.

<p>Abstract: Data collected in the real world often encapsulates historical discrimination against disadvantaged groups and individuals. Existing fair machine learning (FairML) research has predominantly focused on mitigating discriminative bias in the model prediction, with far less effort dedicated towards exploring how to trace biases present in the data, despite its importance for the transparency and interpretability of FairML. To fill this gap, we investigate a novel research problem: discovering samples that reflect biases/prejudices from the training data. Grounding on the existing fairness notions, we lay out a sample bias criterion and propose practical algorithms for measuring and countering sample bias. The derived bias score provides intuitive sample-level attribution and explanation of historical bias in data. On this basis, we further design two FairML strategies via sample-bias-informed minimal data editing. They can mitigate both group and individual unfairness at the cost of minimal or zero predictive utility loss. Extensive experiments and analyses on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in explaining and mitigating unfairness.

<p>Abstract: Efficient and current roadway geometry data collection is critical to transportation agencies in road planning, maintenance, design, and rehabilitation. Data collection methods are divided into land-based and aerial-based. Land-based methods for extensive highway networks are tedious, costly, pose safety risks. Therefore, there is the need for efficient, safe, and economical data acquisition methodologies. The rise of computer vision and object detection technologies have made automated extraction of roadway geometry features feasible. This study detects roadway features on Florida's public roads from high-resolution aerial images using AI. The developed model achieved an average accuracy of 80.4 percent when compared with ground truth data. The extracted roadway geometry data can be integrated with crash and traffic data to provide valuable insights to policymakers and roadway users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rumaisa Azeem, Andrew Hundt, Masoumeh Mansouri, Martim Brand\~ao</p>
<p>Abstract: Members of the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) communities have proposed Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising resource for robotics tasks such as natural language interactions, doing household and workplace tasks, approximating `common sense reasoning', and modeling humans. However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications. To address these concerns, we conduct an HRI-based evaluation of discrimination and safety criteria on several highly-rated LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs currently lack robustness when encountering people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics (e.g., race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections), producing biased outputs consistent with directly discriminatory outcomes -- e.g. `gypsy' and `mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not `european' or `able-bodied' people. Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions -- such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so. Data and code will be made available.</p>

The difficulty level of each programming problem serves as an essential reference for guiding students' adaptive learning. However, current methods of determining difficulty levels either require extensive expert annotations or take a long time to accumulate enough student solutions for each problem. To address this issue, we formulate the problem of automatic difficulty level estimation of each programming problem, given its textual description and a solution example of code. For tackling this problem, we propose to couple two pre-trained models, one for text modality and the other for code modality, into a unified model. We built two POJ datasets for the task and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the contributions of both modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingwen Zhang, Yan Li, De Cheng, Nannan Wang, Junwei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: To facilitate the evolution of edge intelligence in ever-changing environments, we study on-device incremental learning constrained in limited computation resource in this paper. Current on-device training methods just focus on efficient training without considering the catastrophic forgetting, preventing the model getting stronger when continually exploring the world. To solve this problem, a direct solution is to involve the existing incremental learning mechanisms into the on-device training framework. Unfortunately, such a manner cannot work well as those mechanisms usually introduce large additional computational cost to the network optimization process, which would inevitably exceed the memory capacity of the edge devices. To address this issue, this paper makes an early effort to propose a simple but effective edge-friendly incremental learning framework. Based on an empirical study on the knowledge intensity of the kernel elements of the neural network, we find that the center kernel is the key for maximizing the knowledge intensity for learning new data, while freezing the other kernel elements would get a good balance on the model's capacity for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Upon this finding, we further design a center-sensitive kernel optimization framework to largely alleviate the cost of the gradient computation and back-propagation. Besides, a dynamic channel element selection strategy is also proposed to facilitate a sparse orthogonal gradient projection for further reducing the optimization complexity, upon the knowledge explored from the new task data. Extensive experiments validate our method is efficient and effective, e.g., our method achieves average accuracy boost of 38.08% with even less memory and approximate computation compared to existing on-device training methods, indicating its significant potential for on-device incremental learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This project intends to study the image representation based on attention mechanism and multimodal data. By adding multiple pattern layers to the attribute model, the semantic and hidden layers of image content are integrated. The word vector is quantified by the Word2Vec method and then evaluated by a word embedding convolutional neural network. The published experimental results of the two groups were tested. The experimental results show that this method can convert discrete features into continuous characters, thus reducing the complexity of feature preprocessing. Word2Vec and natural language processing technology are integrated to achieve the goal of direct evaluation of missing image features. The robustness of the image feature evaluation model is improved by using the excellent feature analysis characteristics of a convolutional neural network. This project intends to improve the existing image feature identification methods and eliminate the subjective influence in the evaluation process. The findings from the simulation indicate that the novel approach has developed is viable, effectively augmenting the features within the produced representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an approach to build Large Language Model (LLM) based slot-filling system to perform Dialogue State Tracking in conversational assistants serving across a wide variety of industry-grade applications. Key requirements of this system include: 1) usage of smaller-sized models to meet low latency requirements and to enable convenient and cost-effective cloud and customer premise deployments, and 2) zero-shot capabilities to serve across a wide variety of domains, slot types and conversational scenarios. We adopt a fine-tuning approach where a pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned into a slot-filling model using task specific data. The fine-tuning data is prepared carefully to cover a wide variety of slot-filling task scenarios that the model is expected to face across various domains. We give details of the data preparation and model building process. We also give a detailed analysis of the results of our experimental evaluations. Results show that our prescribed approach for slot-filling model building has resulted in 6.9% relative improvement of F1 metric over the best baseline on a realistic benchmark, while at the same time reducing the latency by 57%. More over, the data we prepared has helped improve F1 on an average by 4.2% relative across various slot-types.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital Twins have gained attention in various industries for simulation, monitoring, and decision-making, relying on ever-improving machine learning models. However, agricultural Digital Twin implementations are limited compared to other industries. Meanwhile, machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, has shown potential in agricultural applications like optimizing decision-making, task automation, and resource management. A key aspect of Digital Twins is representing physical assets or systems in a virtual environment, which aligns well with reinforcement learning's need for environment representations to learn the best policy for a task. Reinforcement learning in agriculture can thus enable various Digital Twin applications in agricultural domains. This review aims to categorize existing research employing reinforcement learning in agricultural settings by application domains like robotics, greenhouse management, irrigation systems, and crop management, identifying potential future areas for reinforcement learning-based Digital Twins. It also categorizes the reinforcement learning techniques used, including tabular methods, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient methods, and Actor-Critic algorithms, to overview currently employed models. The review seeks to provide insights into the state-of-the-art in integrating Digital Twins and reinforcement learning in agriculture, identifying gaps and opportunities for future research, and exploring synergies to tackle agricultural challenges and optimize farming, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable farming methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Quan, Huan ZHao, Jinfeng Yi, Yuqiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: CAD (Computer-Aided Design) plays a crucial role in mechanical industry, where large numbers of similar-shaped CAD parts are often created. Efficiently reusing these parts is key to reducing design and production costs for enterprises. Retrieval systems are vital for achieving CAD reuse, but the complex shapes of CAD models are difficult to accurately describe using text or keywords, making traditional retrieval methods ineffective. While existing representation learning approaches have been developed for CAD, manually labeling similar samples in these methods is expensive. Additionally, CAD models' unique parameterized data structure presents challenges for applying existing 3D shape representation learning techniques directly. In this work, we propose GC-CAD, a self-supervised contrastive graph neural network-based method for mechanical CAD retrieval that directly models parameterized CAD raw files. GC-CAD consists of two key modules: structure-aware representation learning and contrastive graph learning framework. The method leverages graph neural networks to extract both geometric and topological information from CAD models, generating feature representations. We then introduce a simple yet effective contrastive graph learning framework approach, enabling the model to train without manual labels and generate retrieval-ready representations. Experimental results on four datasets including human evaluation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements and up to 100 times efficiency improvement over the baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Hu, Jinxin Hu, Ting Xu, Bo Zhang, Jiajie Yuan, Haozhang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: This project intends to study a cardiovascular disease risk early warning model based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks. First, the missing values of 13 physiological and symptom indicators such as patient age, blood glucose, cholesterol, and chest pain were filled and Z-score was standardized. The convolutional neural network is converted into a 2D matrix, the convolution function of 1,3, and 5 is used for the first-order convolution operation, and the Max Pooling algorithm is adopted for dimension reduction. Set the learning rate and output rate. It is optimized by the Adam algorithm. The result of classification is output by a soft classifier. This study was conducted based on Statlog in the UCI database and heart disease database respectively. The empirical data indicate that the forecasting precision of this technique has been enhanced by 11.2%, relative to conventional approaches, while there is a significant improvement in the logarithmic curve fitting. The efficacy and applicability of the novel approach are corroborated through the examination employing a one-dimensional convolutional neural network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature alignment serves as the primary mechanism for fusing multimodal data. We put forth a feature alignment approach that achieves full integration of multimodal information. This is accomplished via an alternating process of shifting and expanding feature representations across modalities to obtain a consistent unified representation in a joint feature space. The proposed technique can reliably capture high-level interplay between features originating from distinct modalities. Consequently, substantial gains in multimodal learning performance are attained. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other prevalent multimodal fusion schemes on a range of tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation conducted on multimodal datasets comprising time series, image, and text demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many application from the bee colony health state monitoring could be efficiently solved using a computer vision techniques. One of such challenges is an efficient way for counting the number of incoming and outcoming bees, which could be used to further analyse many trends, such as the bee colony health state, blooming periods, or for investigating the effects of agricultural spraying. In this paper, we compare three methods for the automated bee counting over two own datasets. The best performing method is based on the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network classifier, which achieved accuracy of 87% over the BUT1 dataset and the accuracy of 93% over the BUT2 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Kaissis, Stefan Kolek, Borja Balle, Jamie Hayes, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially \emph{even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$}, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swapnil Bhosale, Haosen Yang, Diptesh Kanojia, Jiankang Deng, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Zhou, Ben He, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: With the launch of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have attracted global attention. In the realm of article writing, LLMs have witnessed extensive utilization, giving rise to concerns related to intellectual property protection, personal privacy, and academic integrity. In response, AI-text detection has emerged to distinguish between human and machine-generated content. However, recent research indicates that these detection systems often lack robustness and struggle to effectively differentiate perturbed texts. Currently, there is a lack of systematic evaluations regarding detection performance in real-world applications, and a comprehensive examination of perturbation techniques and detector robustness is also absent. To bridge this gap, our work simulates real-world scenarios in both informal and professional writing, exploring the out-of-the-box performance of current detectors. Additionally, we have constructed 12 black-box text perturbation methods to assess the robustness of current detection models across various perturbation granularities. Furthermore, through adversarial learning experiments, we investigate the impact of perturbation data augmentation on the robustness of AI-text detectors. We have released our code and data at https://github.com/zhouying20/ai-text-detector-evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihan Hu, Daomiao Wang, Hong Wu, Jian Liu, Cuiwei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The progression of deep learning and the widespread adoption of sensors have facilitated automatic multi-view fusion (MVF) about the cardiovascular system (CVS) signals. However, prevalent MVF model architecture often amalgamates CVS signals from the same temporal step but different views into a unified representation, disregarding the asynchronous nature of cardiovascular events and the inherent heterogeneity across views, leading to catastrophic view confusion. Efficient training strategies specifically tailored for MVF models to attain comprehensive representations need simultaneous consideration. Crucially, real-world data frequently arrives with incomplete views, an aspect rarely noticed by researchers. Thus, the View-Centric Transformer (VCT) and Multitask Masked Autoencoder (M2AE) are specifically designed to emphasize the centrality of each view and harness unlabeled data to achieve superior fused representations. Additionally, we systematically define the missing-view problem for the first time and introduce prompt techniques to aid pretrained MVF models in flexibly adapting to various missing-view scenarios. Rigorous experiments involving atrial fibrillation detection, blood pressure estimation, and sleep staging-typical health monitoring tasks-demonstrate the remarkable advantage of our method in MVF compared to prevailing methodologies. Notably, the prompt technique requires finetuning less than 3% of the entire model's data, substantially fortifying the model's resilience to view missing while circumventing the need for complete retraining. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, highlighting their potential for practical applications in cardiovascular health monitoring. Codes and models are released at URL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advent of modern deep learning techniques has given rise to advancements in the field of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).

Additionally, we benchmark pretrained encoders of Whisper, HuBERT, Wav2Vec2.0, and WavLM using 10-fold leave-speaker-out cross-validation on five existing multilingual benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, CREMA-D, EmoDB and CaFE and, release a novel dataset for SER on the Hindi language (BhavVani). CAMuLeNet shows an average improvement of approximately 8% over all benchmarks on unseen speakers determined by our cross-validation strategy.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for predicting tool wear in CNC turning operations, combining ultrasonic microphone arrays and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). High-frequency acoustic emissions between 0 kHz and 60 kHz are enhanced using beamforming techniques to improve the signal- to-noise ratio. The processed acoustic data is then analyzed by a CNN, which predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of cutting tools. Trained on data from 350 workpieces machined with a single carbide insert, the model can accurately predict the RUL of the carbide insert. Our results demonstrate the potential gained by integrating advanced ultrasonic sensors with deep learning for accurate predictive maintenance tasks in CNC machining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelun Tony Zhang, Sebastian S. Feger, Lucas Dullenkopf, Rulu Liao, Lukas S\"usslin, Yuanting Liu, Andreas Butz</p>
<p>Abstract: AI is anticipated to enhance human decision-making in high-stakes domains like aviation, but adoption is often hindered by challenges such as inappropriate reliance and poor alignment with users' decision-making. Recent research suggests that a core underlying issue is the recommendation-centric design of many AI systems, i.e., they give end-to-end recommendations and ignore the rest of the decision-making process. Alternative support paradigms are rare, and it remains unclear how the few that do exist compare to recommendation-centric support. In this work, we aimed to empirically compare recommendation-centric support to an alternative paradigm, continuous support, in the context of diversions in aviation. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 32 professional pilots in a realistic setting. To ensure the quality of our study scenarios, we conducted a focus group with four additional pilots prior to the study. We found that continuous support can support pilots' decision-making in a forward direction, allowing them to think more beyond the limits of the system and make faster decisions when combined with recommendations, though the forward support can be disrupted. Participants' statements further suggest a shift in design goal away from providing recommendations, to supporting quick information gathering. Our results show ways to design more helpful and effective AI decision support that goes beyond end-to-end recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Pacini, Xiaowen Dong, Bruno Lepri, Gabriele Santin</p>
<p>Abstract: The separation power of a machine learning model refers to its capacity to distinguish distinct inputs, and it is often employed as a proxy for its expressivity. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to investigate the separation power of equivariant neural networks with point-wise activations. Using the proposed framework, we can derive an explicit description of inputs indistinguishable by a family of neural networks with given architecture, demonstrating that it remains unaffected by the choice of non-polynomial activation function employed. We are able to understand the role played by activation functions in separability. Indeed, we show that all non-polynomial activations, such as ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in terms of expressivity, and that they reach maximum discrimination capacity. We demonstrate how assessing the separation power of an equivariant neural network can be simplified to evaluating the separation power of minimal representations. We conclude by illustrating how these minimal components form a hierarchy in separation power.</p>

<p>Abstract: Following the success of the in-context learning paradigm in large-scale language and computer vision models, the recently emerging field of in-context reinforcement learning is experiencing a rapid growth. However, its development has been held back by the lack of challenging benchmarks, as all the experiments have been carried out in simple environments and on small-scale datasets. We present \textbf{XLand-100B}, a large-scale dataset for in-context reinforcement learning based on the XLand-MiniGrid environment, as a first step to alleviate this problem. It contains complete learning histories for nearly $30,000$ different tasks, covering $100$B transitions and $2.5$B episodes. It took $50,000$ GPU hours to collect the dataset, which is beyond the reach of most academic labs. Along with the dataset, we provide the utilities to reproduce or expand it even further. With this substantial effort, we aim to democratize research in the rapidly growing field of in-context reinforcement learning and provide a solid foundation for further scaling.

<p>Abstract: The latest breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), eg., ChatDev, have catalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent collaboration for software development. LLM agents can collaborate in teams like humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on requirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to perform autonomous software generation. However, for an agent team, each phase in a single development process yields only one possible outcome. This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space. Consequently, this may lead to obtaining suboptimal results. To address this challenge, we introduce Cross-Team Collaboration (CTC), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation. Experimental results in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of our framework. The significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our framework across various domains. We anticipate that our work will guide LLM agents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth in but not limited to software development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Taichi Murayama, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs.

<p>Abstract: There is a recent boom in the development of AI solutions to facilitate and enhance diagnostic procedures for established clinical tools. To assess the integrity of the developing nervous system, the Prechtl general movement assessment (GMA) is recognized for its clinical value in the diagnosis of neurological impairments in early infancy. GMA has been increasingly augmented through machine learning approaches intending to scale-up its application, circumvent costs in the training of human assessors and further standardize classification of spontaneous motor patterns. Available deep learning tools, all of which are based on single sensor modalities, are however still considerably inferior to that of well-trained human assessors. These approaches are hardly comparable as all models are designed, trained and evaluated on proprietary/ silo-data sets. We propose a sensor fusion approach for assessing fidgety movements (FMs) comparing three different sensor modalities (pressure, inertial, and visual sensors). Various combinations and two sensor fusion approaches (late and early fusion) for infant movement classification were tested to evaluate whether a multi-sensor system outperforms single modality assessments. The performance of the three-sensor fusion (classification accuracy of 94.5\%) was significantly higher than that of any single modality evaluated, suggesting the sensor fusion approach is a promising avenue for automated classification of infant motor patterns. The development of a robust sensor fusion system may significantly enhance AI-based early recognition of neurofunctions, ultimately facilitating early implementation of automated detection of neurodevelopmental conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arda Sarp Yenicesu, Furkan B. Mutlu, Suleyman S. Kozat, Ozgur S. Oguz</p>
<p>Abstract: The utilization of the experience replay mechanism enables agents to effectively leverage their experiences on several occasions. In previous studies, the sampling probability of the transitions was modified based on their relative significance. The process of reassigning sample probabilities for every transition in the replay buffer after each iteration is considered extremely inefficient. Hence, in order to enhance computing efficiency, experience replay prioritization algorithms reassess the importance of a transition as it is sampled. However, the relative importance of the transitions undergoes dynamic adjustments when the agent's policy and value function are iteratively updated. Furthermore, experience replay is a mechanism that retains the transitions generated by the agent's past policies, which could potentially diverge significantly from the agent's most recent policy. An increased deviation from the agent's most recent policy results in a greater frequency of off-policy updates, which has a negative impact on the agent's performance. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm, Corrected Uniform Experience Replay (CUER), which stochastically samples the stored experience while considering the fairness among all other experiences without ignoring the dynamic nature of the transition importance by making sampled state distribution more on-policy. CUER provides promising improvements for off-policy continuous control algorithms in terms of sample efficiency, final performance, and stability of the policy during the training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph pooling has gained attention for its ability to obtain effective node and graph representations for various downstream tasks. Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 15 graph pooling methods and 21 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis and parameter analysis. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liu, Ruihao Gong, Mingyang Zhang, Yefei He, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: The typical process for developing LLMs involves pre-training a general foundation model on massive data, followed by fine-tuning on task-specific data to create specialized experts. Serving these experts poses challenges, as loading all experts onto devices is impractical, and frequent switching between experts in response to user requests incurs substantial I/O costs, increasing latency and expenses. Previous approaches decompose expert weights into pre-trained model weights and residual delta weights, then quantize the delta weights to reduce model size. However, these methods often lead to significant quantization errors at extremely low bitwidths and assume the appropriate model for a user request is known in advance, which is not practical. To address these issues, we introduce ME-Switch, a memory-efficient expert switching framework for LLM serving. ME-Switch uses mixed-precision quantization, selectively quantizing non-salient input channels of delta weights to extremely low bits while keeping salient ones intact, significantly reducing storage demands while maintaining performance. Additionally, we develop a routing method that efficiently directs user queries to the most suitable expert by transforming the model selection problem into a domain classification problem. Extensive experiments show ME-Switch's promising memory efficiency and routing performance. For example, when serving three models from the Mistral-7B family, ME-Switch reduces model size by 1.74x while maintaining nearly lossless performance on instruction, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks. Furthermore, ME-Switch can efficiently serve 16 models from the Mistral-7B family on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumadeep Saha, Sutanoya Chakraborty, Saptarshi Saha, Utpal Garain</p>
<p>Abstract: Crosswords are a form of word puzzle that require a solver to demonstrate a high degree of proficiency in natural language understanding, wordplay, reasoning, and world knowledge, along with adherence to character and length constraints. In this paper we tackle the challenge of solving crosswords with Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate that the current generation of state-of-the art (SoTA) language models show significant competence at deciphering cryptic crossword clues, and outperform previously reported SoTA results by a factor of 2-3 in relevant benchmarks. We also develop a search algorithm that builds off this performance to tackle the problem of solving full crossword grids with LLMs for the very first time, achieving an accuracy of 93\% on New York Times crossword puzzles. Contrary to previous work in this area which concluded that LLMs lag human expert performance significantly, our research suggests this gap is a lot narrower.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohaib Younis, Bernhard Seeger</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning is a challenging problem in machine learning, especially for image classification tasks with imbalanced datasets. It becomes even more challenging when it involves learning new classes incrementally. One method for incremental class learning, addressing dataset imbalance, is rehearsal using previously stored data. In rehearsal-based methods, access to previous data is required for either training the classifier or the generator, but it may not be feasible due to storage, legal, or data access constraints. Although there are many rehearsal-free alternatives for class incremental learning, such as parameter or loss regularization, knowledge distillation, and dynamic architectures, they do not consistently achieve good results, especially on imbalanced data. This paper proposes a new approach called Data-Free Generative Replay (DFGR) for class incremental learning, where the generator is trained without access to real data. In addition, DFGR also addresses dataset imbalance in continual learning of an image classifier. Instead of using training data, DFGR trains a generator using mean and variance statistics of batch-norm and feature maps derived from a pre-trained classification model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that DFGR performs significantly better than other data-free methods and reveal the performance impact of specific parameter settings. DFGR achieves up to 88.5% and 46.6% accuracy on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/2younis/DFGR</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Tao, Zhiyu Li, Dinghao Xi, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced text generation capabilities across various industries. However, these models' ability to generate human-like text poses substantial challenges in discerning between human and AI authorship. Despite the effectiveness of existing AI-generated text detectors, their development is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, publicly available benchmarks. Current benchmarks are limited to specific scenarios, such as question answering and text polishing, and predominantly focus on English texts, failing to capture the diverse applications and linguistic nuances of LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper constructs a comprehensive bilingual benchmark in both Chinese and English to evaluate mainstream AI-generated text detectors. We categorize LLM text generation into five distinct operations: Create, Update, Delete, Rewrite, and Translate (CUDRT), encompassing all current LLMs activities. We also establish a robust benchmark evaluation framework to support scalable and reproducible experiments. For each CUDRT category, we have developed extensive datasets to thoroughly assess detector performance. By employing the latest mainstream LLMs specific to each language, our datasets provide a thorough evaluation environment. Extensive experimental results offer critical insights for optimizing AI-generated text detectors and suggest future research directions to improve detection accuracy and generalizability across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claude Formanek, Callum Rhys Tilbury, Louise Beyers, Jonathan Shock, Arnu Pretorius</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging field with great promise for real-world applications. Unfortunately, the current state of research in offline MARL is plagued by inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols, which ultimately makes it difficult to accurately assess progress, trust newly proposed innovations, and allow researchers to easily build upon prior work. In this paper, we firstly identify significant shortcomings in existing methodologies for measuring the performance of novel algorithms through a representative study of published offline MARL work. Secondly, by directly comparing to this prior work, we demonstrate that simple, well-implemented baselines can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, we show that on 35 out of 47 datasets used in prior work (almost 75% of cases), we match or surpass the performance of the current purported SOTA. Strikingly, our baselines often substantially outperform these more sophisticated algorithms. Finally, we correct for the shortcomings highlighted from this prior work by introducing a straightforward standardised methodology for evaluation and by providing our baseline implementations with statistically robust results across several scenarios, useful for comparisons in future work. Our proposal includes simple and sensible steps that are easy to adopt, which in combination with solid baselines and comparative results, could substantially improve the overall rigour of empirical science in offline MARL moving forward.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, the inadvertent propagation of biases inherent in training datasets poses significant ethical challenges, particularly in the generation of socially sensitive content. This paper introduces EquiPrompt, a novel method employing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to reduce biases in text-to-image generative models. EquiPrompt uses iterative bootstrapping and bias-aware exemplar selection to balance creativity and ethical responsibility. It integrates iterative reasoning refinement with controlled evaluation techniques, addressing zero-shot CoT issues in sensitive contexts. Experiments on several generation tasks show EquiPrompt effectively lowers bias while maintaining generative quality, advancing ethical AI and socially responsible creative processes.Code will be publically available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Nuo Lei, Boli Chen, Bingbing Li, Rulong Li, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based intelligent energy management systems for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are crucial for achieving efficient energy utilization. However, their application faces system reliability challenges in the real world, which prevents widespread acceptance by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This paper begins by establishing a PHEV model based on physical and data-driven models, focusing on the high-fidelity training environment. It then proposes a real-vehicle application-oriented control framework, combining horizon-extended reinforcement learning (RL)-based energy management with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) to enhance practical applicability, and improves the flawed method of equivalent factor evaluation based on instantaneous driving cycle and powertrain states found in existing research. Finally, comprehensive simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validation are carried out which demonstrates the advantages of the proposed control framework in fuel economy over adaptive-ECMS and rule-based strategies. Compared to conventional RL architectures that directly control powertrain components, the proposed control method not only achieves similar optimality but also significantly enhances the disturbance resistance of the energy management system, providing an effective control framework for RL-based energy management strategies aimed at real-vehicle applications by OEMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) introduce a paradigm of neural modeling that implements learnable functions on the edges of the networks, diverging from the traditional node-centric activations in neural networks. This work assesses the applicability and efficacy of KANs in visual modeling, focusing on the image recognition task. We mainly analyze the performance and efficiency of different network architectures built using KAN concepts along with conventional building blocks of convolutional and linear layers, enabling a comparative analysis with the conventional models. Our findings are aimed at contributing to understanding the potential of KANs in computer vision, highlighting both their strengths and areas for further research. Our evaluation shows that whereas KAN-based architectures perform in-line with the original claims of KAN paper for performance and model-complexity in the case of simpler vision datasets like MNIST, the advantages seem to diminish even for slightly more complex datasets like CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenwei Lin, Hanjia Lyu, Xian Xu, Jiebo Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications such as image recognition and visual reasoning, and have also shown promising potential in specialized domains. However, the application potential of LVLMs in the insurance domain-characterized by rich application scenarios and abundant multimodal data-has not been effectively explored. There is no systematic review of multimodal tasks in the insurance domain, nor a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance domain. In this paper, we systematically review and distill multimodal tasks for four representative types of insurance: auto insurance, property insurance, health insurance, and agricultural insurance. We propose INS-MMBench, the first comprehensive LVLMs benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench comprises a total of 2.2K thoroughly designed multiple-choice questions, covering 12 meta-tasks and 22 fundamental tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple representative LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like BLIP-2. This evaluation not only validates the effectiveness of our benchmark but also provides an in-depth performance analysis of current LVLMs on various multimodal tasks in the insurance domain. We hope that INS-MMBench will facilitate the further application of LVLMs in the insurance domain and inspire interdisciplinary development.

<p>Abstract: The goal for classification is to correctly assign labels to unseen samples. However, most methods misclassify samples with unseen labels and assign them to one of the known classes. Open-Set Classification (OSC) algorithms aim to maximize both closed and open-set recognition capabilities. Recent studies showed the utility of such algorithms on small-scale data sets, but limited experimentation makes it difficult to assess their performances in real-world problems. Here, we provide a comprehensive comparison of various OSC algorithms, including training-based (SoftMax, Garbage, EOS) and post-processing methods (Maximum SoftMax Scores, Maximum Logit Scores, OpenMax, EVM, PROSER), the latter are applied on features from the former. We perform our evaluation on three large-scale protocols that mimic real-world challenges, where we train on known and negative open-set samples, and test on known and unknown instances. Our results show that EOS helps to improve performance of almost all post-processing algorithms. Particularly, OpenMax and PROSER are able to exploit better-trained networks, demonstrating the utility of hybrid models. However, while most algorithms work well on negative test samples -- samples of open-set classes seen during training -- they tend to perform poorly when tested on samples of previously unseen unknown classes, especially in challenging conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Injoon Hwang, Haewon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jooyoung Yang, SunJae Maeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a prominent method that adds a small number of learnable parameters to the frozen pre-trained weights for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Prompted by the question, ``Can we make its representation enough with LoRA weights solely at the final phase of finetuning without the pre-trained weights?'' In this work, we introduce Progressive Compression LoRA~(PC-LoRA), which utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to simultaneously perform model compression and fine-tuning. The PC-LoRA method gradually removes the pre-trained weights during the training process, eventually leaving only the low-rank adapters in the end. Thus, these low-rank adapters replace the whole pre-trained weights, achieving the goals of compression and fine-tuning at the same time. Empirical analysis across various models demonstrates that PC-LoRA achieves parameter and FLOPs compression rates of 94.36%/89.1% for vision models, e.g., ViT-B, and 93.42%/84.2% parameters and FLOPs compressions for language models, e.g., BERT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Liu, Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Lingkai Kong, Zhiyuan Zhao, Chao Zhang, B. Aditya Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial to equip TSF models with out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as historical training data and future test data can have different distributions. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the conventional assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF.
  To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that enables timeseries Forecasting for Out-of-distribution generalization via Invariant Learning. FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved variables. Further, FOIL implements a joint optimization by alternately inferring environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal adjacency structure, and learning invariant representations across inferred environments for OOD generalized TSF. We demonstrate that the proposed FOIL significantly improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving gains of up to 85%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A B M Ashikur Rahman, Saeed Anwar, Muhammad Usman, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, revolutionizing the integration of AI in daily life applications. However, they are prone to hallucinations, generating claims that contradict established facts, deviating from prompts, and producing inconsistent responses when the same prompt is presented multiple times. Addressing these issues is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and easily assessable benchmark datasets. Most existing datasets are small and rely on multiple-choice questions, which are inadequate for evaluating the generative prowess of LLMs. To measure hallucination in LLMs, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising over 75,000 prompts across eight domains. These prompts are designed to elicit definitive, concise, and informative answers. The dataset is divided into two segments: one publicly available for testing and assessing LLM performance and a hidden segment for benchmarking various LLMs. In our experiments, we tested six LLMs-GPT-3.5, LLama 2, LLama 3, Gemini, Mixtral, and Zephyr-revealing that overall factual hallucination ranges from 59% to 82% on the public dataset and 57% to 76% in the hidden benchmark. Prompt misalignment hallucination ranges from 6% to 95% in the public dataset and 17% to 94% in the hidden counterpart. Average consistency ranges from 21% to 61% and 22% to 63%, respectively. Domain-wise analysis shows that LLM performance significantly deteriorates when asked for specific numeric information while performing moderately with person, location, and date queries. Our dataset demonstrates its efficacy and serves as a comprehensive benchmark for LLM performance evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boshen Wang, Bowei Ye, Lin Xu, Jie Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: In silico methods evaluating the mutation effects of missense mutations are providing an important approach for understanding mutations in personal genomes and identifying disease-relevant biomarkers. However, existing methods, including deep learning methods, heavily rely on sequence-aware information, and do not fully leverage the potential of available 3D structural information. In addition, these methods may exhibit an inability to predict mutations in domains difficult to formulate sequence-based embeddings. In this study, we introduce a novel rationale-guided graph neural network AlphaGMut to evaluate mutation effects and to distinguish pathogenic mutations from neutral mutations. We compute the alpha shapes of protein structures to obtain atomic-resolution edge connectivities and map them to an accurate residue-level graph representation. We then compute structural-, topological-, biophysical-, and sequence properties of the mutation sites, which are assigned as node attributes in the graph. These node attributes could effectively guide the graph neural network to learn the difference between pathogenic and neutral mutations using k-hop message passing with a short training period. We demonstrate that AlphaGMut outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including DeepMind's AlphaMissense, in many performance metrics. In addition, AlphaGMut has the advantage of performing well in alignment-free settings, which provides broader prediction coverage and better generalization compared to current methods requiring deep sequence-aware information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Yu, Dongyue Chen, Qilong Wang, Qinghua Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities. When domain distribution changes, the fragility of subtle features leads to a pronounced deterioration in model performance.Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning both the commonality and specificity within categories.Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG. Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is achieved through a decorrelation function on disentangled segments, constraints on common feature consistency, specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration operation across granularities. By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.1% in terms of FGDG performance. Beyond that, the explainability analysis and experiments on various mainstream model architectures confirm the validity of FS.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology, the production of realistic fake facial images and videos that deceive human visual perception has become possible. Consequently, various face forgery detection techniques have been proposed to identify such fake facial content. However, evaluating the effectiveness and generalizability of these detection techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this, we have constructed a large-scale evaluation benchmark called DeepFaceGen, aimed at quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of face forgery detection and facilitating the iterative development of forgery detection technology. DeepFaceGen consists of 776,990 real face image/video samples and 773,812 face forgery image/video samples, generated using 34 mainstream face generation techniques. During the construction process, we carefully consider important factors such as content diversity, fairness across ethnicities, and availability of comprehensive labels, in order to ensure the versatility and convenience of DeepFaceGen. Subsequently, DeepFaceGen is employed in this study to evaluate and analyze the performance of 13 mainstream face forgery detection techniques from various perspectives. Through extensive experimental analysis, we derive significant findings and propose potential directions for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Lingxi Li, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Content generation conditioning on users's readability is an important application for personalization. In an era of large language models (LLMs), readability-controlled text generation based on LLMs has become increasingly important. This paper introduces a novel methodology called "Readability-Controlled Instruction Learning (ReadCtrl)," which aims to instruction-tune LLMs to tailor users' readability levels. Unlike the traditional methods, which primarily focused on categorical readability adjustments typically classified as high, medium, and low or expert and layperson levels with limited success, ReadCtrl introduces a dynamic framework that enables LLMs to generate content at various (near continuous level) complexity levels, thereby enhancing their versatility across different applications. Our results show that the ReadCtrl-Mistral-7B models significantly outperformed strong baseline models such as GPT-4 and Claude-3, with a win rate of 52.1%:35.7% against GPT-4 in human evaluations. Furthermore, Read-Ctrl has shown significant improvements in automatic evaluations, as evidenced by better readability metrics (e.g., FOG, FKGL) and generation quality metrics (e.g., BLEU, SARI, SummaC-Factuality, UniEval-Consistency and Coherence). These results underscore Read-Ctrl's effectiveness and tenacity in producing high-quality, contextually appropriate outputs that closely align with targeted readability levels, marking a significant advancement in personalized content generation using LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Active learning is an iterative labeling process that is used to obtain a small labeled subset, despite the absence of labeled data, thereby enabling to train a model for supervised tasks such as text classification. While active learning has made considerable progress in recent years due to improvements provided by pre-trained language models, there is untapped potential in the often neglected unlabeled portion of the data, although it is available in considerably larger quantities than the usually small set of labeled data. Here we investigate how self-training, a semi-supervised approach where a model is used to obtain pseudo-labels from the unlabeled data, can be used to improve the efficiency of active learning for text classification. Starting with an extensive reproduction of four previous self-training approaches, some of which are evaluated for the first time in the context of active learning or natural language processing, we devise HAST, a new and effective self-training strategy, which is evaluated on four text classification benchmarks, on which it outperforms the reproduced self-training approaches and reaches classification results comparable to previous experiments for three out of four datasets, using only 25% of the data.</p>

A novel approach to model averaging and knowledge-based constraints was implemented to arrive at a consensus structure for causal inference. The structure learning process highlighted the importance of exploring data-driven approaches alongside clinical expertise. This includes discovering unexpected, although reasonable, relationships from a clinical perspective. Hypothetical interventions on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Alcohol dependence, and Diabetes suggest that the presence of any of these risk factors in patients increases the likelihood of Sepsis. This finding, alongside measuring the effect of these risk factors on Sepsis, has potential policy implications. Recognising the importance of prediction in improving Sepsis related health outcomes, the model built is also assessed in its ability to predict Sepsis. The predictions generated by the consensus model were assessed for their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These three indicators all had results around 70%, and the AUC was 80%, which means the causal structure of the model is reasonably accurate given that the models were trained on data available for commissioning purposes only.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Chen, Junfei Tan, An Zhang, Zhengyi Yang, Leheng Sheng, Enzhi Zhang, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems aim to predict personalized rankings based on user preference data. With the rise of Language Models (LMs), LM-based recommenders have been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning abilities. Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical interactions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target response and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current objective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for personalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based recommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax loss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (\textbf{S-DPO}) to instill ranking information into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred items from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. Specifically, we incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an alternative version of DPO loss tailored for LM-based recommenders, connected to softmax sampling strategies. Theoretically, we bridge S-DPO with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has a side effect of mining hard negatives, which assures its exceptional capabilities in recommendation tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of S-DPO to effectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance while mitigating the data likelihood decline issue of DPO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samar Fares, Klea Ziu, Toluwani Aremu, Nikita Durasov, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}, Pascal Fua, Karthik Nandakumar, Ivan Laptev</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks as various novel attack strategies are being proposed against these models. While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maneesha Wickramasuriya, Taeyoung Lee, Murray Snyder</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in general-purpose AI have highlighted the importance of guiding AI systems towards the intended goals, ethical principles, and values of individuals and groups, a concept broadly recognized as alignment. However, the lack of clarified definitions and scopes of human-AI alignment poses a significant obstacle, hampering collaborative efforts across research domains to achieve this alignment. In particular, ML- and philosophy-oriented alignment research often views AI alignment as a static, unidirectional process (i.e., aiming to ensure that AI systems' objectives match humans) rather than an ongoing, mutual alignment problem [429]. This perspective largely neglects the long-term interaction and dynamic changes of alignment. To understand these gaps, we introduce a systematic review of over 400 papers published between 2019 and January 2024, spanning multiple domains such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and others. We characterize, define and scope human-AI alignment. From this, we present a conceptual framework of "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment" to organize the literature from a human-centered perspective. This framework encompasses both 1) conventional studies of aligning AI to humans that ensures AI produces the intended outcomes determined by humans, and 2) a proposed concept of aligning humans to AI, which aims to help individuals and society adjust to AI advancements both cognitively and behaviorally. Additionally, we articulate the key findings derived from literature analysis, including discussions about human values, interaction techniques, and evaluations. To pave the way for future studies, we envision three key challenges for future directions and propose examples of potential future solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changan Chen, Puyuan Peng, Ami Baid, Zihui Xue, Wei-Ning Hsu, David Harwarth, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic audio for human interactions is important for many applications, such as creating sound effects for films or virtual reality games. Existing approaches implicitly assume total correspondence between the video and audio during training, yet many sounds happen off-screen and have weak to no correspondence with the visuals -- resulting in uncontrolled ambient sounds or hallucinations at test time. We propose a novel ambient-aware audio generation model, AV-LDM. We devise a novel audio-conditioning mechanism to learn to disentangle foreground action sounds from the ambient background sounds in in-the-wild training videos. Given a novel silent video, our model uses retrieval-augmented generation to create audio that matches the visual content both semantically and temporally. We train and evaluate our model on two in-the-wild egocentric video datasets Ego4D and EPIC-KITCHENS. Our model outperforms an array of existing methods, allows controllable generation of the ambient sound, and even shows promise for generalizing to computer graphics game clips. Overall, our work is the first to focus video-to-audio generation faithfully on the observed visual content despite training from uncurated clips with natural background sounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational Large Language Models are trained to refuse to answer harmful questions. However, emergent jailbreaking techniques can still elicit unsafe outputs, presenting an ongoing challenge for model alignment. To better understand how different jailbreak types circumvent safeguards, this paper analyses model activations on different jailbreak inputs. We find that it is possible to extract a jailbreak vector from a single class of jailbreaks that works to mitigate jailbreak effectiveness from other classes. This may indicate that different kinds of effective jailbreaks operate via similar internal mechanisms. We investigate a potential common mechanism of harmfulness feature suppression, and provide evidence for its existence by looking at the harmfulness vector component. These findings offer actionable insights for developing more robust jailbreak countermeasures and lay the groundwork for a deeper, mechanistic understanding of jailbreak dynamics in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Wu, Yulia Rubanova, Rishabh Kabra, Drew A. Hudson, Igor Gilitschenski, Yusuf Aytar, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Kelsey R. Allen, Thomas Kipf</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the problem of multi-object 3D pose control in image diffusion models. Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use a set of per-object representations, Neural Assets, to control the 3D pose of individual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual representations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video, and are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image, e.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from the reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame. This enables learning disentangled appearance and pose features. Combining visual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to keep the text-to-image architecture of existing models, with Neural Assets in place of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and placement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that Neural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-object editing results on both synthetic 3D scene datasets, as well as two real-world video datasets (Objectron, Waymo Open).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuj Mishra, James Fox, Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal games are probabilistic graphical models that enable causal queries to be answered in multi-agent settings. They extend causal Bayesian networks by specifying decision and utility variables to represent the agents' degrees of freedom and objectives. In multi-agent settings, whether each agent decides on their policy before or after knowing the causal intervention is important as this affects whether they can respond to the intervention by adapting their policy. Consequently, previous work in causal games imposed chronological constraints on permissible interventions. We relax this by outlining a sound and complete set of primitive causal interventions so the effect of any arbitrarily complex interventional query can be studied in multi-agent settings. We also demonstrate applications to the design of safe AI systems by considering causal mechanism design and commitment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delong Ran, Jinyuan Liu, Yichen Gong, Jingyi Zheng, Xinlei He, Tianshuo Cong, Anyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful responses for forbidden instructions, presenting severe misuse threats to LLMs. Up to now, research into jailbreak attacks and defenses is emerging, however, there is (surprisingly) no consensus on how to evaluate whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. In other words, the methods to assess the harmfulness of an LLM's response are varied, such as manual annotation or prompting GPT-4 in specific ways. Each approach has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, impacting their alignment with human values, as well as the time and financial cost. This diversity in evaluation presents challenges for researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and conducting fair comparisons across different jailbreak attacks and defenses. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly ninety jailbreak research released between May 2023 and April 2024. Our study introduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering in-depth insights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of their adaptation. Moreover, to facilitate subsequent research, we propose JailbreakEval, a user-friendly toolkit focusing on the evaluation of jailbreak attempts. It includes various well-known evaluators out-of-the-box, so that users can obtain evaluation results with only a single command. JailbreakEval also allows users to customize their own evaluation workflow in a unified framework with the ease of development and comparison. In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a catalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and fosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Xu, Fan Liu, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline benchmark for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 320 experiments with about 50,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Bag_of_Tricks_for_LLM_Jailbreaking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence techniques for education have been received increasing attentions, while it still remains an open problem to design the effective music instrument instructing systems. Although key presses can be directly derived from sheet music, the transitional movements among key presses require more extensive guidance in piano performance. In this work, we construct a piano-hand motion generation benchmark to guide hand movements and fingerings for piano playing. To this end, we collect an annotated dataset, PianoMotion10M, consisting of 116 hours of piano playing videos from a bird's-eye view with 10 million annotated hand poses. We also introduce a powerful baseline model that generates hand motions from piano audios through a position predictor and a position-guided gesture generator. Furthermore, a series of evaluation metrics are designed to assess the performance of the baseline model, including motion similarity, smoothness, positional accuracy of left and right hands, and overall fidelity of movement distribution. Despite that piano key presses with respect to music scores or audios are already accessible, PianoMotion10M aims to provide guidance on piano fingering for instruction purposes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seohong Park, Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: While imitation learning requires access to high-quality data, offline reinforcement learning (RL) should, in principle, perform similarly or better with substantially lower data quality by using a value function. However, current results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation learning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline RL. Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in current offline RL algorithms. While poor performance of offline RL is typically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: is the main bottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something else? To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1) value learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline RL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance. We make two surprising observations. First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction algorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL, often more so than the value learning objective. For instance, we show that common value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully leverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained policy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial improvements in performance and scalability. Second, we find that a big barrier to improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on test-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy learning on in-distribution states. We then show that the use of suboptimal but high-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this generalization issue in practice. Specifically, we propose two simple test-time policy improvement methods and show that these methods lead to better performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have showcased remarkable zero-shot recognition abilities yet face challenges in visio-linguistic compositionality, particularly in linguistic comprehension and fine-grained image-text alignment. This paper explores the intricate relationship between compositionality and recognition -- two pivotal aspects of VLM capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, covering both pre-training approaches aimed at recognition and the fine-tuning methods designed to improve compositionality. Our evaluation employs 12 benchmarks for compositionality, along with 21 zero-shot classification and two retrieval benchmarks for recognition. In our analysis from 274 CLIP model checkpoints, we reveal patterns and trade-offs that emerge between compositional understanding and recognition accuracy. Ultimately, this necessitates strategic efforts towards developing models that improve both capabilities, as well as the meticulous formulation of benchmarks for compositionality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Zagardo</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often incorporate vast amounts of data, raising significant privacy concerns. Machine unlearning, the ability to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, addresses these concerns. This paper explores practical methods for implementing machine unlearning, focusing on a first-epoch gradient-ascent approach.
  Key findings include: 1. Single vs. Multi-Epoch Unlearning: First-epoch gradient unlearning is more effective than multi-epoch gradients. 2. Layer-Based Unlearning: The embedding layer in GPT-2 is crucial for effective unlearning. Gradients from the output layers (11 and 12) have no impact. Efficient unlearning can be achieved using only the embedding layer, halving space complexity. 3. Influence Functions & Scoring: Techniques like Hessian Vector Product and the dot product of activations and tensors are used for quantifying unlearning. 4. Gradient Ascent Considerations: Calibration is necessary to avoid overexposing the model to specific data points during unlearning, which could prematurely terminate the process. 5. Fuzzy Matching vs. Iterative Unlearning: Fuzzy matching techniques shift the model to a new optimum, while iterative unlearning provides a more complete modality.
  Our empirical evaluation confirms that first-epoch gradient ascent for machine unlearning is more effective than whole-model gradient ascent. These results highlight the potential of machine unlearning for enhancing data privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. The study underscores the importance of formal methods to comprehensively evaluate the unlearning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many tasks within NLP can be framed as sequential decision problems, ranging from sequence tagging to text generation. However, for many tasks, the standard training methods, including maximum likelihood (teacher forcing) and scheduled sampling, suffer from exposure bias and a mismatch between metrics employed during training and inference. DAgger provides a solution to mitigate these problems, yet it requires a metric-specific dynamic oracle algorithm, which does not exist for many common metrics like span-based F1, ROUGE, and BLEU. In this paper, we develop these novel dynamic oracles and show they maintain DAgger's no-regret guarantee for decomposable metrics like span-based F1. We evaluate the algorithm's performance on named entity recognition (NER), text summarization, and machine translation (MT). While DAgger with dynamic oracle yields less favorable results in our MT experiments, it outperforms the baseline techniques in NER and text summarization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaosen Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Zhen Xing, Yifei Ma, Zuxuan Wu, Ji Li, Zheng Zhang, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Xin Geng, Baining Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vision models are trained on very large noisy datasets. While these models acquire strong capabilities, they may not follow the user's intent to output the desired results in certain aspects, e.g., visual aesthetic, preferred style, and responsibility. In this paper, we target the realm of visual aesthetics and aim to align vision models with human aesthetic standards in a retrieval system. Advanced retrieval systems usually adopt a cascade of aesthetic models as re-rankers or filters, which are limited to low-level features like saturation and perform poorly when stylistic, cultural or knowledge contexts are involved. We find that utilizing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) to rephrase the search query and extend the aesthetic expectations can make up for this shortcoming. Based on the above findings, we propose a preference-based reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes the vision models to distill the knowledge from both LLMs reasoning and the aesthetic models to better align the vision models with human aesthetics. Meanwhile, with rare benchmarks designed for evaluating retrieval systems, we leverage large multi-modality model (LMM) to evaluate the aesthetic performance with their strong abilities. As aesthetic assessment is one of the most subjective tasks, to validate the robustness of LMM, we further propose a novel dataset named HPIR to benchmark the alignment with human aesthetics. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the aesthetic behaviors of the vision models, under several metrics. We believe the proposed algorithm can be a general practice for aligning vision models with human values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyuan Lyu, Tai Wang, Jingli Lin, Shuai Yang, Xiaohan Mao, Yilun Chen, Runsen Xu, Haifeng Huang, Chenming Zhu, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of LLMs and their integration with other data modalities, multi-modal 3D perception attracts more attention due to its connectivity to the physical world and makes rapid progress. However, limited by existing datasets, previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or inter-object spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this paper builds the first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark with hierarchical grounded language annotations, MMScan. It is constructed based on a top-down logic, from region to object level, from a single target to inter-target relationships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute understanding. The overall pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully designed prompts to initialize the annotations efficiently and further involve humans' correction in the loop to ensure the annotations are natural, correct, and comprehensive. Built upon existing 3D scanning data, the resulting multi-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M meta-annotated captions on 109k objects and 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M diverse samples for 3D visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks. We evaluate representative baselines on our benchmarks, analyze their capabilities in different aspects, and showcase the key problems to be addressed in the future. Furthermore, we use this high-quality dataset to train state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding and LLMs and obtain remarkable performance improvement both on existing benchmarks and in-the-wild evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linzhan Mou, Jun-Kun Chen, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes Instruct 4D-to-4D that achieves 4D awareness and spatial-temporal consistency for 2D diffusion models to generate high-quality instruction-guided dynamic scene editing results. Traditional applications of 2D diffusion models in dynamic scene editing often result in inconsistency, primarily due to their inherent frame-by-frame editing methodology. Addressing the complexities of extending instruction-guided editing to 4D, our key insight is to treat a 4D scene as a pseudo-3D scene, decoupled into two sub-problems: achieving temporal consistency in video editing and applying these edits to the pseudo-3D scene. Following this, we first enhance the Instruct-Pix2Pix (IP2P) model with an anchor-aware attention module for batch processing and consistent editing. Additionally, we integrate optical flow-guided appearance propagation in a sliding window fashion for more precise frame-to-frame editing and incorporate depth-based projection to manage the extensive data of pseudo-3D scenes, followed by iterative editing to achieve convergence. We extensively evaluate our approach in various scenes and editing instructions, and demonstrate that it achieves spatially and temporally consistent editing results, with significantly enhanced detail and sharpness over the prior art. Notably, Instruct 4D-to-4D is general and applicable to both monocular and challenging multi-camera scenes. Code and more results are available at immortalco.github.io/Instruct-4D-to-4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun-Kun Chen, Samuel Rota Bul\`o, Norman M\"uller, Lorenzo Porzi, Peter Kontschieder, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes ConsistDreamer - a novel framework that lifts 2D diffusion models with 3D awareness and 3D consistency, thus enabling high-fidelity instruction-guided scene editing. To overcome the fundamental limitation of missing 3D consistency in 2D diffusion models, our key insight is to introduce three synergetic strategies that augment the input of the 2D diffusion model to become 3D-aware and to explicitly enforce 3D consistency during the training process. Specifically, we design surrounding views as context-rich input for the 2D diffusion model, and generate 3D-consistent, structured noise instead of image-independent noise. Moreover, we introduce self-supervised consistency-enforcing training within the per-scene editing procedure. Extensive evaluation shows that our ConsistDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance for instruction-guided scene editing across various scenes and editing instructions, particularly in complicated large-scale indoor scenes from ScanNet++, with significantly improved sharpness and fine-grained textures. Notably, ConsistDreamer stands as the first work capable of successfully editing complex (e.g., plaid/checkered) patterns. Our project page is at immortalco.github.io/ConsistDreamer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Bachmann, O\u{g}uzhan Fatih Kar, David Mizrahi, Ali Garjani, Mingfei Gao, David Griffiths, Jiaming Hu, Afshin Dehghan, Amir Zamir</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal and multitask foundation models like 4M or UnifiedIO show promising results, but in practice their out-of-the-box abilities to accept diverse inputs and perform diverse tasks are limited by the (usually rather small) number of modalities and tasks they are trained on. In this paper, we expand upon the capabilities of them by training a single model on tens of highly diverse modalities and by performing co-training on large-scale multimodal datasets and text corpora. This includes training on several semantic and geometric modalities, feature maps from recent state of the art models like DINOv2 and ImageBind, pseudo labels of specialist models like SAM and 4DHumans, and a range of new modalities that allow for novel ways to interact with the model and steer the generation, for example image metadata or color palettes. A crucial step in this process is performing discrete tokenization on various modalities, whether they are image-like, neural network feature maps, vectors, structured data like instance segmentation or human poses, or data that can be represented as text. Through this, we expand on the out-of-the-box capabilities of multimodal models and specifically show the possibility of training one model to solve at least 3x more tasks/modalities than existing ones and doing so without a loss in performance. This enables more fine-grained and controllable multimodal generation capabilities and allows us to study the distillation of models trained on diverse data and objectives into a unified model. We successfully scale the training to a three billion parameter model using tens of modalities and different datasets. The resulting models and training code are open sourced at 4m.epfl.ch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansheng Li, Linlin Wang, Tingzhu Wang, Xue Yang, Junwei Luo, Qi Wang, Youming Deng, Wenbin Wang, Xian Sun, Haifeng Li, Bo Dang, Yongjun Zhang, Yi Yu, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) in satellite imagery (SAI) benefits promoting intelligent understanding of geospatial scenarios from perception to cognition. In SAI, objects exhibit great variations in scales and aspect ratios, and there exist rich relationships between objects (even between spatially disjoint objects), which makes it necessary to holistically conduct SGG in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) SAI. However, the lack of SGG datasets with large-size VHR SAI has constrained the advancement of SGG in SAI. Due to the complexity of large-size VHR SAI, mining triplets <subject, relationship, object> in large-size VHR SAI heavily relies on long-range contextual reasoning. Consequently, SGG models designed for small-size natural imagery are not directly applicable to large-size VHR SAI. To address the scarcity of datasets, this paper constructs a large-scale dataset for SGG in large-size VHR SAI with image sizes ranging from 512 x 768 to 27,860 x 31,096 pixels, named RSG, encompassing over 210,000 objects and more than 400,000 triplets. To realize SGG in large-size VHR SAI, we propose a context-aware cascade cognition (CAC) framework to understand SAI at three levels: object detection (OBD), pair pruning and relationship prediction. As a fundamental prerequisite for SGG in large-size SAI, a holistic multi-class object detection network (HOD-Net) that can flexibly integrate multi-scale contexts is proposed. With the consideration that there exist a huge amount of object pairs in large-size SAI but only a minority of object pairs contain meaningful relationships, we design a pair proposal generation (PPG) network via adversarial reconstruction to select high-value pairs. Furthermore, a relationship prediction network with context-aware messaging (RPCM) is proposed to predict the relationship types of these pairs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MuirBench, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on robust multi-image understanding capabilities of multimodal LLMs. MuirBench consists of 12 diverse multi-image tasks (e.g., scene understanding, ordering) that involve 10 categories of multi-image relations (e.g., multiview, temporal relations). Comprising 11,264 images and 2,600 multiple-choice questions, MuirBench is created in a pairwise manner, where each standard instance is paired with an unanswerable variant that has minimal semantic differences, in order for a reliable assessment. Evaluated upon 20 recent multi-modal LLMs, our results reveal that even the best-performing models like GPT-4o and Gemini Pro find it challenging to solve MuirBench, achieving 68.0% and 49.3% in accuracy. Open-source multimodal LLMs trained on single images can hardly generalize to multi-image questions, hovering below 33.3% in accuracy. These results highlight the importance of MuirBench in encouraging the community to develop multimodal LLMs that can look beyond a single image, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose to build omni-modal intelligence, which is capable of understanding any modality and learning universal representations. In specific, we propose a scalable pretraining paradigm, named Multimodal Context (MiCo), which can scale up the numbers of modalities and amount of data, together with the model parameters, in the pretraining process. With MiCo, the pretrained models show significant emergent abilities in multimodal learning, which are evaluated on the following tasks: i) single-modality perception benchmarks of 10 different modalities, ii) 25 cross-modality understanding tasks of retrieval, question-answering, captioning, and iii) 18 multimodal large language model benchmarks. Our models establish 37 new records for state-of-the-art performance. We hope that our research could contribute to the development of omni-modal intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> N'Dah Jean Kouagou, Stefan Heindorf, Caglar Demir, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo</p>
<p>Abstract: Many applications require explainable node classification in knowledge graphs. Towards this end, a popular ``white-box'' approach is class expression learning: Given sets of positive and negative nodes, class expressions in description logics are learned that separate positive from negative nodes. Most existing approaches are search-based approaches generating many candidate class expressions and selecting the best one. However, they often take a long time to find suitable class expressions. In this paper, we cast class expression learning as a translation problem and propose a new family of class expression learning approaches which we dub neural class expression synthesizers. Training examples are ``translated'' into class expressions in a fashion akin to machine translation. Consequently, our synthesizers are not subject to the runtime limitations of search-based approaches. We study three instances of this novel family of approaches based on LSTMs, GRUs, and set transformers, respectively. An evaluation of our approach on four benchmark datasets suggests that it can effectively synthesize high-quality class expressions with respect to the input examples in approximately one second on average. Moreover, a comparison to state-of-the-art approaches suggests that we achieve better F-measures on large datasets. For reproducibility purposes, we provide our implementation as well as pretrained models in our public GitHub repository at https://github.com/dice-group/NeuralClassExpressionSynthesis</p>

<p>Abstract: There are several different game description languages (GDLs), each intended to allow wide ranges of arbitrary games (i.e., general games) to be described in a single higher-level language than general-purpose programming languages. Games described in such formats can subsequently be presented as challenges for automated general game playing agents, which are expected to be capable of playing any arbitrary game described in such a language without prior knowledge about the games to be played. The language used by the Ludii general game system was previously shown to be capable of representing equivalent games for any arbitrary, finite, deterministic, fully observable extensive-form game. In this paper, we prove its universality by extending this to include finite non-deterministic and imperfect-information games.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the capacity of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to autonomously design incentive-compatible contracts in dual-principal-agent settings, a relatively unexplored aspect of algorithmic mechanism design. We develop a dynamic model where two principals, each equipped with independent Q-learning algorithms, interact with a single agent. Our findings reveal that the strategic behavior of AI principals (cooperation vs. competition) hinges crucially on the alignment of their profits. Notably, greater profit alignment fosters collusive strategies, yielding higher principal profits at the expense of agent incentives. This emergent behavior persists across varying degrees of principal heterogeneity, multiple principals, and environments with uncertainty. Our study underscores the potential of AI for contract automation while raising critical concerns regarding strategic manipulation and the emergence of unintended collusion in AI-driven systems, particularly in the context of the broader AI alignment problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is pivotal for human interaction with the digital world, enabling efficient device control and the completion of complex tasks. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) offers the chance to create advanced GUI agents. To ensure their effectiveness, there's a pressing need for qualified benchmarks that provide trustworthy and reproducible evaluations -- a challenge current benchmarks often fail to address. To tackle this issue, we introduce Mobile-Env, a comprehensive toolkit tailored for creating GUI benchmarks in the Android mobile environment. Mobile-Env offers an isolated and controllable setting for reliable evaluations, and accommodates intermediate instructions and rewards to reflect real-world usage more naturally. Utilizing Mobile-Env, we collect an open-world task set across various real-world apps and a fixed world set, WikiHow, which captures a significant amount of dynamic online contents for fully controllable and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of LLM agents using these benchmarks. Our findings reveal that even advanced models (e.g., GPT-4V and LLaMA-3) struggle with tasks that are relatively simple for humans. This highlights a crucial gap in current models and underscores the importance of developing more capable foundation models and more effective GUI agent frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Martens, James Hinns, Camille Dams, Mark Vergouwen, Theodoros Evgeniou</p>
<p>Abstract: In many AI applications today, the predominance of black-box machine learning models, due to their typically higher accuracy, amplifies the need for Explainable AI (XAI). Existing XAI approaches, such as the widely used SHAP values or counterfactual (CF) explanations, are arguably often too technical for users to understand and act upon. To enhance comprehension of explanations of AI decisions and the overall user experience, we introduce XAIstories, which leverage Large Language Models to provide narratives about how AI predictions are made: SHAPstories do so based on SHAP explanations, while CFstories do so for CF explanations. We study the impact of our approach on users' experience and understanding of AI predictions. Our results are striking: over 90% of the surveyed general audience finds the narratives generated by SHAPstories convincing. Data scientists primarily see the value of SHAPstories in communicating explanations to a general audience, with 83% of data scientists indicating they are likely to use SHAPstories for this purpose. In an image classification setting, CFstories are considered more or equally convincing as the users' own crafted stories by more than 75% of the participants. CFstories additionally bring a tenfold speed gain in creating a narrative. We also find that SHAPstories help users to more accurately summarize and understand AI decisions, in a credit scoring setting we test, correctly answering comprehension questions significantly more often than they do when only SHAP values are provided. The results thereby suggest that XAIstories may significantly help explaining and understanding AI predictions, ultimately supporting better decision-making in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tessa Han, Aounon Kumar, Chirag Agarwal, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop increasingly sophisticated capabilities and find applications in medical settings, it becomes important to assess their medical safety due to their far-reaching implications for personal and public health, patient safety, and human rights. However, there is little to no understanding of the notion of medical safety in the context of LLMs, let alone how to evaluate and improve it. To address this gap, we first define the notion of medical safety in LLMs based on the Principles of Medical Ethics set forth by the American Medical Association. We then leverage this understanding to introduce MedSafetyBench, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to measure the medical safety of LLMs. We demonstrate the utility of MedSafetyBench by using it to evaluate and improve the medical safety of LLMs. Our results show that publicly-available medical LLMs do not meet standards of medical safety and that fine-tuning them using MedSafetyBench improves their medical safety. By introducing this new benchmark dataset, our work enables a systematic study of the state of medical safety in LLMs and motivates future work in this area, thereby mitigating the safety risks of LLMs in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lirui Luo, Guoxi Zhang, Hongming Xu, Yaodong Yang, Cong Fang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning (NS-RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for explainable decision-making, characterized by the interpretability of symbolic policies. NS-RL entails structured state representations for tasks with visual observations, but previous methods cannot refine the structured states with rewards due to a lack of efficiency. Accessibility also remains an issue, as extensive domain knowledge is required to interpret symbolic policies. In this paper, we present a neuro-symbolic framework for jointly learning structured states and symbolic policies, whose key idea is to distill the vision foundation model into an efficient perception module and refine it during policy learning. Moreover, we design a pipeline to prompt GPT-4 to generate textual explanations for the learned policies and decisions, significantly reducing users' cognitive load to understand the symbolic policies. We verify the efficacy of our approach on nine Atari tasks and present GPT-generated explanations for policies and decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents that control computer interfaces to accomplish human tasks are emerging. Leveraging LLMs to power such agents has been of special interest, but unless fine-tuned on human-collected task demonstrations, performance is still relatively low. In this work we study whether fine-tuning alone is a viable approach for building real-world computer control agents. In particularly, we investigate how performance measured on both high and low-level tasks in domain and out of domain scales as more training data is collected. To this end we collect and release a new dataset, AndroidControl, consisting of 15,283 demonstrations of everyday tasks with Android apps. Compared to existing datasets, each AndroidControl task instance includes both high and low-level human-generated instructions, allowing us to explore the level of task complexity an agent can handle. Moreover, AndroidControl is the most diverse computer control dataset to date, including 15,283 unique tasks over 833 Android apps, thus allowing us to conduct in-depth analysis of the model performance in and out of the domain of the training data. Using the dataset, we find that when tested in domain fine-tuned models outperform zero and few-shot baselines and scale in such a way that robust performance might feasibly be obtained simply by collecting more data. Out of domain, performance scales significantly more slowly and suggests that in particular for high-level tasks, fine-tuning on more data alone may be insufficient for achieving robust out-of-domain performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venkat Venkatasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often criticized for lacking true "understanding" and an ability to "reason" with their knowledge, being seen merely as advanced autocomplete systems. We believe that this perspective might be missing an important insight. We suggest that LLMs do develop a kind of empirical "understanding" that is "geometry"-like, which seems quite sufficient for a range of applications in NLP, computer vision, coding assistance, etc. However, this "geometric" understanding, built from incomplete and noisy data, makes them unreliable, difficult to generalize, and lacking in inference capabilities and explanations, similar to the challenges faced by heuristics-based expert systems decades ago.
  To overcome these limitations, we suggest that LLMs should be integrated with an "algebraic" representation of knowledge that includes symbolic AI elements used in expert systems. This integration aims to create large knowledge models (LKMs) that not only possess "deep" knowledge grounded in first principles, but also have the ability to reason and explain, mimicking human expert capabilities. To harness the full potential of generative AI safely and effectively, a paradigm shift from LLMs to the more comprehensive LKMs is needed.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the MCT Self-Refine (MCTSr) algorithm, an innovative integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), designed to enhance performance in complex mathematical reasoning tasks. Addressing the challenges of accuracy and reliability in LLMs, particularly in strategic and mathematical reasoning, MCTSr leverages systematic exploration and heuristic self-refine mechanisms to improve decision-making frameworks within LLMs. The algorithm constructs a Monte Carlo search tree through iterative processes of Selection, self-refine, self-evaluation, and Backpropagation, utilizing an improved Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula to optimize the exploration-exploitation balance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkyu Kim, Hyun-Soo Choi, Jinho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for handling graph-structured data. However, their design often limits them to learning only higher-order feature interactions, leaving low-order feature interactions overlooked. To address this problem, we introduce a novel GNN method called explicit feature interaction-aware graph neural network (EFI-GNN). Unlike conventional GNNs, EFI-GNN is a multilayer linear network designed to model arbitrary-order feature interactions explicitly within graphs. To validate the efficacy of EFI-GNN, we conduct experiments using various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EFI-GNN has competitive performance with existing GNNs, and when a GNN is jointly trained with EFI-GNN, predictive performance sees an improvement. Furthermore, the predictions made by EFI-GNN are interpretable, owing to its linear construction. The source code of EFI-GNN is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/EFI-GNN</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Mao, Lixin Zou, Yujia Zheng, Jiliang Tang, Xiaokai Chu, Jiashu Zhao, Qian Wang, Dawei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The page presentation biases in the information retrieval system, especially on the click behavior, is a well-known challenge that hinders improving ranking models' performance with implicit user feedback. Unbiased Learning to Rank~(ULTR) algorithms are then proposed to learn an unbiased ranking model with biased click data. However, most existing algorithms are specifically designed to mitigate position-related bias, e.g., trust bias, without considering biases induced by other features in search result page presentation(SERP), e.g. attractive bias induced by the multimedia. Unfortunately, those biases widely exist in industrial systems and may lead to an unsatisfactory search experience. Therefore, we introduce a new problem, i.e., whole-page Unbiased Learning to Rank(WP-ULTR), aiming to handle biases induced by whole-page SERP features simultaneously. It presents tremendous challenges: (1) a suitable user behavior model (user behavior hypothesis) can be hard to find; and (2) complex biases cannot be handled by existing algorithms. To address the above challenges, we propose a Bias Agnostic whole-page unbiased Learning to rank algorithm, named BAL, to automatically find the user behavior model with causal discovery and mitigate the biases induced by multiple SERP features with no specific design. Experimental results on a real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of the BAL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Krogmann, Pascal Lenzner, Alexander Skopalik</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a non-cooperative two-sided facility location game in which facilities and clients behave strategically. This is in contrast to many other facility location games in which clients simply visit their closest facility. Facility agents select a location on a graph to open a facility to attract as much purchasing power as possible, while client agents choose which facilities to patronize by strategically distributing their purchasing power in order to minimize their total waiting time. Here, the waiting time of a facility depends on its received total purchasing power. We show that our client stage is an atomic splittable congestion game, which implies existence, uniqueness and efficient computation of a client equilibrium. Therefore, facility agents can efficiently predict client behavior and make strategic decisions accordingly. Despite that, we prove that subgame perfect equilibria do not exist in all instances of this game and that their existence is NP-hard to decide. On the positive side, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute 3-approximate subgame perfect equilibria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Martin, Tuomas Sandholm</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been substantial progress on finding game-theoretic equilibria. Most of that work has focused on games with finite, discrete action spaces. However, many games involving space, time, money, and other fine-grained quantities have continuous action spaces (or are best modeled as having such). We study the problem of finding an approximate Nash equilibrium of games with continuous action sets. The standard measure of closeness to Nash equilibrium is exploitability, which measures how much players can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy. We propose two new methods that minimize an approximation of exploitability with respect to the strategy profile. The first method uses a learned best-response function, which takes the current strategy profile as input and outputs candidate best responses for each player. The strategy profile and best-response functions are trained simultaneously, with the former trying to minimize exploitability while the latter tries to maximize it. The second method maintains an ensemble of candidate best responses for each player. In each iteration, the best-performing elements of each ensemble are used to update the current strategy profile. The strategy profile and ensembles are simultaneously trained to minimize and maximize the approximate exploitability, respectively. We evaluate our methods on various continuous games and GAN training, showing that they outperform prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Loftin, Mustafa Mert \c{C}elikok, Herke van Hoof, Samuel Kaski, Frans A. Oliehoek</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent problems requiring a high degree of cooperation, success often depends on the ability of the agents to adapt to each other's behavior. A natural solution concept in such settings is the Stackelberg equilibrium, in which the ``leader'' agent selects the strategy that maximizes its own payoff given that the ``follower'' agent will choose their best response to this strategy. Recent work has extended this solution concept to two-player differentiable games, such as those arising from multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, in the form of the \textit{differential} Stackelberg equilibrium. While this previous work has presented learning dynamics which converge to such equilibria, these dynamics are ``coupled'' in the sense that the learning updates for the leader's strategy require some information about the follower's payoff function. As such, these methods cannot be applied to truly decentralised multi-agent settings, particularly ad hoc cooperation, where each agent only has access to its own payoff function. In this work we present ``uncoupled'' learning dynamics based on zeroth-order gradient estimators, in which each agent's strategy update depends only on their observations of the other's behavior. We analyze the convergence of these dynamics in general-sum games, and prove that they converge to differential Stackelberg equilibria under the same conditions as previous coupled methods. Furthermore, we present an online mechanism by which symmetric learners can negotiate leader-follower roles. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work for multi-agent reinforcement learning and ad hoc collaboration more generally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Huang, Niao He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the Tiered Reinforcement Learning setting, a parallel transfer learning framework, where the goal is to transfer knowledge from the low-tier (source) task to the high-tier (target) task to reduce the exploration risk of the latter while solving the two tasks in parallel. Unlike previous work, we do not assume the low-tier and high-tier tasks share the same dynamics or reward functions, and focus on robust knowledge transfer without prior knowledge on the task similarity. We identify a natural and necessary condition called the ``Optimal Value Dominance'' for our objective. Under this condition, we propose novel online learning algorithms such that, for the high-tier task, it can achieve constant regret on partial states depending on the task similarity and retain near-optimal regret when the two tasks are dissimilar, while for the low-tier task, it can keep near-optimal without making sacrifice. Moreover, we further study the setting with multiple low-tier tasks, and propose a novel transfer source selection mechanism, which can ensemble the information from all low-tier tasks and allow provable benefits on a much larger state-action space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhong, Jiachen Hu, Yecheng Xue, Tongyang Li, Liwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While quantum reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted a surge of attention recently, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, it remains elusive how to design provably efficient quantum RL algorithms that can address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. To this end, we propose a novel UCRL-style algorithm that takes advantage of quantum computing for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and horizon $H$, and establish an $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(S, A, H, \log T))$ worst-case regret for it, where $T$ is the number of episodes. Furthermore, we extend our results to quantum RL with linear function approximation, which is capable of handling problems with large state spaces. Specifically, we develop a quantum algorithm based on value target regression (VTR) for linear mixture MDPs with $d$-dimensional linear representation and prove that it enjoys $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d, H, \log T))$ regret. Our algorithms are variants of UCRL/UCRL-VTR algorithms in classical RL, which also leverage a novel combination of lazy updating mechanisms and quantum estimation subroutines. This is the key to breaking the $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$-regret barrier in classical RL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the online exploration in quantum RL with provable logarithmic worst-case regret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zineb Benhmidouch, Saad Moufid, Aissam Ait Omar</p>
<p>Abstract: Denavit and Hartenberg based methods as Cardan, Fick and Euler angles describe the position and orientation of an end-effector in Three Dimensional (3D) space. However, the generation of unrealistic human posture in joint space constitutes the weak point to these methods because they impose a well-defined rotations order. A method to handle the transformation homogeneous performance uses the dual quaternions. Quaternions have proven themselves in many fields as providing a computational efficient method to represent a rotation, and yet, they can not deal with the translations in 3D-space. The dual numbers can extend quaternions to dual quaternions. This paper exploits dual quaternions theory to provide a fast and accurate solution to the forward, inverse kinematics and recursive Newton-Euler dynamics algorithm for 7 Degree of Freedom (DOF) human lower limb in 3D-space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Gadea Harder, Simon Krogmann, Pascal Lenzner, Alexander Skopalik</p>
<p>Abstract: The strategic selection of resources by selfish agents is a classic research direction, with Resource Selection Games and Congestion Games as prominent examples. In these games, agents select available resources and their utility then depends on the number of agents using the same resources. This implies that there is no distinction between the agents, i.e., they are anonymous.
  We depart from this very general setting by proposing Resource Selection Games with heterogeneous agents that strive for joint resource usage with similar agents. So, instead of the number of other users of a given resource, our model considers agents with different types and the decisive feature is the fraction of same-type agents among the users. More precisely, similarly to Schelling Games, there is a tolerance threshold $\tau \in [0,1]$ which specifies the agents' desired minimum fraction of same-type agents on a resource. Agents strive to select resources where at least a $\tau$-fraction of those resources' users have the same type as themselves. For $\tau=1$, our model generalizes Hedonic Diversity Games with a peak at $1$.
  For our general model, we consider the existence and quality of equilibria and the complexity of maximizing social welfare. Additionally, we consider a bounded rationality model, where agents can only estimate the utility of a resource, since they only know the fraction of same-type agents on a given resource, but not the exact numbers. Thus, they cannot know the impact a strategy change would have on a target resource. Interestingly, we show that this type of bounded rationality yields favorable game-theoretic properties and specific equilibria closely approximate equilibria of the full knowledge setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Zhang, Liangming Pan, Junzhou Zhao, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models often necessitate grounding on external knowledge to generate faithful and reliable answers. Yet even with the correct groundings in the reference, they can ignore them and rely on wrong groundings or their inherent biases to hallucinate when users, being largely unaware of the specifics of the stored information, pose questions that might not directly correlate with the retrieved groundings. In this work, we formulate this knowledge alignment problem and introduce MixAlign, a framework that interacts with both the human user and the knowledge base to obtain and integrate clarifications on how the user question relates to the stored information. MixAlign employs a language model to achieve automatic knowledge alignment and, if necessary, further enhances this alignment through human user clarifications. Experimental results highlight the crucial role of knowledge alignment in boosting model performance and mitigating hallucination, with improvements noted up to 22.2% and 27.1% respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of MixAlign in improving knowledge alignment by producing high-quality, user-centered clarifications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Disease name normalization is an important task in the medical domain. It classifies disease names written in various formats into standardized names, serving as a fundamental component in smart healthcare systems for various disease-related functions. Nevertheless, the most significant obstacle to existing disease name normalization systems is the severe shortage of training data. Consequently, we present a novel data augmentation approach that includes a series of data augmentation techniques and some supporting modules to help mitigate the problem. Our proposed methods rely on the Structural Invariance property of disease names and the Hierarchy property of the disease classification system. The goal is to equip the models with extensive understanding of the disease names and the hierarchical structure of the disease name classification system. Through extensive experimentation, we illustrate that our proposed approach exhibits significant performance improvements across various baseline models and training objectives, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of large language models tailored for handling patients' clinical notes is often hindered by the limited accessibility and usability of these notes due to strict privacy regulations. To address these challenges, we first create synthetic large-scale clinical notes using publicly available case reports extracted from biomedical literature. We then use these synthetic notes to train our specialized clinical large language model, Asclepius. While Asclepius is trained on synthetic data, we assess its potential performance in real-world applications by evaluating it using real clinical notes. We benchmark Asclepius against several other large language models, including GPT-3.5-turbo and other open-source alternatives. To further validate our approach using synthetic notes, we also compare Asclepius with its variants trained on real clinical notes. Our findings convincingly demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes can serve as viable substitutes for real ones when constructing high-performing clinical language models. This conclusion is supported by detailed evaluations conducted by both GPT-4 and medical professionals. All resources including weights, codes, and data used in the development of Asclepius are made publicly accessible for future research. (https://github.com/starmpcc/Asclepius)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghui Qin, Corby Rosset, Ethan C. Chau, Nikhil Rao, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) are inefficient in long contexts. We propose Dodo, a solution for context compression. Instead of one vector per token in a standard transformer model, Dodo represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space. Moreover, off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA can be adapted to Dodo by efficient parameter tuning methods such as LoRA. In use, Dodo can act as either an autoregressive LM or a context compressor for downstream tasks. We demonstrate through experiments in language modeling, question answering, and summarization that Dodo retains capabilities in these tasks, while drastically reducing the overhead during decoding. For example, in the autoencoding task, Dodo shrinks context at a 20x compression ratio with a BLEU score of 98% for reconstruction, achieving nearly lossless encoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Liu, Shaotian Yan, Chen Shen, Liang Xie, Wenxiao Wang, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploiting large language models (LLMs) to tackle reasoning has garnered growing attention. It still remains highly challenging to achieve satisfactory results in complex logical problems, characterized by plenty of premises within the prompt and requiring multi-hop reasoning. In particular, the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are brittle to disorder and distractibility. In this work, we first examine the mechanism from the perspective of information flow and reveal that LLMs exhibit failure patterns akin to human-like cognitive biases when dealing with disordered and irrelevant content in reasoning tasks. However, in contrast to LLMs, disordered and irrelevant content does not significantly decrease human performance, as humans have a propensity to distill the most relevant information and systematically organize their thoughts, aiding them in responding to questions. Stem from that, we further propose a novel reasoning approach named Concise and Organized Perception (COP). COP carefully analyzes the given statements to identify the most pertinent information while eliminating redundancy efficiently. It then prompts the LLMs in a more organized form that adapts to the model's inference process. By perceiving concise and organized context, the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be better elicited. Extensive experimental results on several popular logical benchmarks (ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, PrOntoQA-OOD, and FOLIO) and math benchmark (DI-GSM) show that COP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this work, we introduce DEFT-UCS, a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that leverages unsupervised core-set selection to identify a smaller, representative dataset that reduces the amount of data needed to fine-tune PLMs for downstream tasks. We examine the efficacy of DEFT-UCS in the context of text-editing LMs, and compare to the state-of-the art text-editing model, CoEDIT. Our results demonstrate that DEFT-UCS models are just as accurate as CoEDIT, across eight different datasets consisting of six different editing tasks, while finetuned on 70% less data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haosen Yang, Chuofan Ma, Bin Wen, Yi Jiang, Zehuan Yuan, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the semantics of individual regions or patches of unconstrained images, such as open-world object detection, remains a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Building on the success of powerful image-level vision-language (ViL) foundation models like CLIP, recent efforts have sought to harness their capabilities by either training a contrastive model from scratch with an extensive collection of region-label pairs or aligning the outputs of a detection model with image-level representations of region proposals. Despite notable progress, these approaches are plagued by computationally intensive training requirements, susceptibility to data noise, and deficiency in contextual information. To address these limitations, we explore the synergistic potential of off-the-shelf foundation models, leveraging their respective strengths in localization and semantics. We introduce a novel, generic, and efficient architecture, named RegionSpot, designed to integrate position-aware localization knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) with semantic information from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP). To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep both foundation models frozen, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight attention-based knowledge integration module. Extensive experiments in open-world object recognition show that our RegionSpot achieves significant performance gain over prior alternatives, along with substantial computational savings (e.g., training our model with 3 million data in a single day using 8 V100 GPUs). RegionSpot outperforms GLIP-L by 2.9 in mAP on LVIS val set, with an even larger margin of 13.1 AP for more challenging and rare categories, and a 2.5 AP increase on ODinW. Furthermore, it exceeds GroundingDINO-L by 11.0 AP for rare categories on the LVIS minival set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy McMahan, Xiaojin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and study constrained Markov Decision Processes (cMDPs) with anytime constraints. An anytime constraint requires the agent to never violate its budget at any point in time, almost surely. Although Markovian policies are no longer sufficient, we show that there exist optimal deterministic policies augmented with cumulative costs. In fact, we present a fixed-parameter tractable reduction from anytime-constrained cMDPs to unconstrained MDPs. Our reduction yields planning and learning algorithms that are time and sample-efficient for tabular cMDPs so long as the precision of the costs is logarithmic in the size of the cMDP. However, we also show that computing non-trivial approximately optimal policies is NP-hard in general. To circumvent this bottleneck, we design provable approximation algorithms that efficiently compute or learn an arbitrarily accurate approximately feasible policy with optimal value so long as the maximum supported cost is bounded by a polynomial in the cMDP or the absolute budget. Given our hardness results, our approximation guarantees are the best possible under worst-case analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) architectures are hungry for annotated data, which make them costly and time-consuming to deploy. We introduce the problem of few-shot transfer learning for KBQA, where the target domain offers only a few labeled examples, but a large labeled training dataset is available in a source domain. We propose a novel KBQA architecture called FuSIC-KBQA that performs KB-retrieval using multiple source-trained retrievers, re-ranks using an LLM and uses this as input for LLM few-shot in-context learning to generate logical forms. These are further refined using execution-guided feedback. Experiments over multiple source-target KBQA pairs of varying complexity show that FuSIC-KBQA significantly outperforms adaptations of SoTA KBQA models for this setting. Additional experiments show that FuSIC-KBQA also outperforms SoTA KBQA models in the in-domain setting when training data is limited.</p>

<p>Abstract: The critical field of psychology necessitates a comprehensive benchmark to enhance the evaluation and development of domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing MMLU-type benchmarks, such as C-EVAL and CMMLU, include psychology-related subjects, but their limited number of questions and lack of systematic concept sampling strategies mean they cannot cover the concepts required in psychology. Consequently, despite their broad subject coverage, these benchmarks lack the necessary depth in the psychology domain, making them inadequate as psychology-specific evaluation suite. To address this issue, this paper presents ConceptPsy, designed to evaluate Chinese complex reasoning and knowledge abilities in psychology. ConceptPsy includes 12 core subjects and 1383 manually collected concepts. Specifically, we prompt GPT-4 to generate questions for each concept using carefully designed diverse prompts and hire professional psychologists to review these questions. To help to understand the fine-grained performances and enhance the weaknesses, we annotate each question with a chapter label and provide chapter-wise accuracy. Based on ConceptPsy, we evaluate a broad range of LLMs. We observe that, although some LLMs achieve similar accuracies on overall performances, they exhibit significant performance variations across different psychology concepts, even when they are models from the same series. We hope our work can facilitate the development of LLMs in the field of psychology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanbin Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Ganqu Cui, Ning Ding, Zhiyuan Liu, Ge Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces INTERVENOR (INTERactiVE chaiN Of Repair), a system designed to emulate the interactive code repair processes observed in humans, encompassing both code diagnosis and code repair. INTERVENOR prompts Large Language Models (LLMs) to play distinct roles during the code repair process, functioning as both a Code Learner and a Code Teacher. Specifically, the Code Learner is tasked with adhering to instructions to generate or repair code, while the Code Teacher is responsible for crafting a Chain-of-Repair (CoR) to serve as guidance for the Code Learner. During generating the CoR, the Code Teacher needs to check the generated codes from Code Learner and reassess how to address code bugs based on error feedback received from compilers. Experimental results demonstrate that INTERVENOR surpasses baseline models, exhibiting improvements of approximately 18% and 4.3% over GPT-3.5 in code generation and code translation tasks, respectively. Our further analyses show that CoR is effective to illuminate the reasons behind bugs and outline solution plans in natural language. With the feedback of code compilers, INTERVENOR can accurately identify syntax errors and assertion errors and provide precise instructions to repair codes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sirui Cheng, Siyu Zhang, Jiayi Wu, Muchen Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Within the multimodal field, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress due to their strong perception and reasoning capabilities in the visual and language systems. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility. Our code will be released upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MMMU: a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal models on massive multi-discipline tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning. MMMU includes 11.5K meticulously collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. These questions span 30 subjects and 183 subfields, comprising 30 highly heterogeneous image types, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMMU focuses on advanced perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, challenging models to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. The evaluation of 14 open-source LMMs as well as the proprietary GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini highlights the substantial challenges posed by MMMU. Even the advanced GPT-4V and Gemini Ultra only achieve accuracies of 56% and 59% respectively, indicating significant room for improvement. We believe MMMU will stimulate the community to build next-generation multimodal foundation models towards expert artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Luo, Siddhesh Khandelwal, Leonid Sigal, Boyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: From image-text pairs, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words, which prove effective for tasks like visual question answering. However, leveraging the learned association for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss. To balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. PnP-OVSS does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over comparable baselines (+26.2% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +20.5% mIoU on MS COCO, +3.1% mIoU on COCO Stuff and +3.0% mIoU on ADE20K).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Zaccone, Carlo Masone, Marco Ciccone</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios. However, system and statistical challenges hinder real-world applications, which demand efficient learning from edge devices and robustness to heterogeneity. Despite significant research efforts, existing approaches (i) are not sufficiently robust, (ii) do not perform well in large-scale scenarios, and (iii) are not communication efficient. In this work, we propose a novel Generalized Heavy-Ball Momentum (GHBM), motivating its principled application to counteract the effects of statistical heterogeneity in FL. Then, we present FedHBM as an adaptive, communication-efficient by-design instance of GHBM. Extensive experimentation on vision and language tasks, in both controlled and realistic large-scale scenarios, provides compelling evidence of substantial and consistent performance gains over the state of the art.</p>

The rationale extraction task identifies the court's accepting arguments from alleged arguments by plaintiffs and defendants, which is a novel task in the field. JTD is constructed based on annotated 3,477 Japanese Civil Code judgments by 41 legal experts, resulting in 7,978 instances with 59,697 of their alleged arguments from the involved parties. Our baseline experiments show the feasibility of the proposed two tasks, and our error analysis by legal experts identifies sources of errors and suggests future directions of the LJP research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeseok Byun, Dohoon Kim, Taesup Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a critical issue of false negatives in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), a challenge that arises from the inherent many-to-many correspondence of image-text pairs in large-scale web-crawled datasets. The presence of false negatives can impede achieving optimal performance and even lead to a significant performance drop. To address this challenge, we propose MAFA (MAnaging FAlse negatives), which consists of two pivotal components building upon the recently developed GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy: 1) an efficient connection mining process that identifies and converts false negatives into positives, and 2) label smoothing for the image-text contrastive (ITC) loss. Our comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of MAFA across multiple downstream tasks, emphasizing the crucial role of addressing false negatives in VLP, potentially even surpassing the importance of addressing false positives. In addition, the compatibility of MAFA with the recent BLIP-family model is also demonstrated. Code is available at https://github.com/jaeseokbyun/MAFA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilin Huang, Zihao Sheng, Chengyuan Ma, Sikai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in autonomous vehicles (AVs), the development of driving policies that ensure both the safety of AVs and traffic flow efficiency has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an enhanced human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI mentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which facilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon. Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an innovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into AI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves as a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore uncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous situations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the other hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance, thereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data collected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two training sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually designing reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action values from partial human demonstrations to guide the agents' policy learning. Additionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human mentor's cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms traditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of traffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Kaufman, Jean Costa, Everlyne Kimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in autonomous driving provide an opportunity for AI-assisted driving instruction that directly addresses the critical need for human driving improvement. How should an AI instructor convey information to promote learning? In a pre-post experiment (n = 41), we tested the impact of an AI Coach's explanatory communications modeled after performance driving expert instructions. Participants were divided into four (4) groups to assess two (2) dimensions of the AI coach's explanations: information type ('what' and 'why'-type explanations) and presentation modality (auditory and visual). We compare how different explanatory techniques impact driving performance, cognitive load, confidence, expertise, and trust via observational learning. Through interview, we delineate participant learning processes. Results show AI coaching can effectively teach performance driving skills to novices. We find the type and modality of information influences performance outcomes. Differences in how successfully participants learned are attributed to how information directs attention, mitigates uncertainty, and influences overload experienced by participants. Results suggest efficient, modality-appropriate explanations should be opted for when designing effective HMI communications that can instruct without overwhelming. Further, results support the need to align communications with human learning and cognitive processes. We provide eight design implications for future autonomous vehicle HMI and AI coach design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaru Isonuma, Ivan Titov</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the training datasets that influence a language model's outputs is essential for minimizing the generation of harmful content and enhancing its performance. Ideally, we can measure the influence of each dataset by removing it from training; however, it is prohibitively expensive to retrain a model multiple times. This paper presents UnTrac: unlearning traces the influence of a training dataset on the model's performance. UnTrac is extremely simple; each training dataset is unlearned by gradient ascent, and we evaluate how much the model's predictions change after unlearning. Furthermore, we propose a more scalable approach, UnTrac-Inv, which unlearns a test dataset and evaluates the unlearned model on training datasets. UnTrac-Inv resembles UnTrac, while being efficient for massive training datasets. In the experiments, we examine if our methods can assess the influence of pretraining datasets on generating toxic, biased, and untruthful content. Our methods estimate their influence much more accurately than existing methods while requiring neither excessive memory space nor multiple checkpoints.</p>

Pre-trained embedding extractors can be accessed in an off-the-shelf manner and we demonstrate the toolkit's versatility by showcasing its integration with two tasks. Another goal is to integrate with diverse self-supervised learning features.

<p>Abstract: Despite large neural networks demonstrating remarkable abilities to complete different tasks, they require excessive memory usage to store the optimization states for training. To alleviate this, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is proposed to reduce the optimization states by training fewer parameters. However, LoRA restricts overall weight update matrices to be low-rank, limiting the model performance. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of LoRA and identify that it can be approximated by a random projection. Based on this observation, we propose Flora, which is able to achieve high-rank updates by resampling the projection matrices while enjoying the sublinear space complexity of optimization states. We conduct experiments across different tasks and model architectures to verify the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhou Xia, Sadhika Malladi, Suchin Gururangan, Sanjeev Arora, Danqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning has unlocked powerful capabilities in large language models (LLMs), effectively using combined datasets to develop generalpurpose chatbots. However, real-world applications often require a specialized suite of skills (e.g., reasoning). The challenge lies in identifying the most relevant data from these extensive datasets to effectively develop specific capabilities, a setting we frame as targeted instruction tuning. We propose LESS, an optimizer-aware and practically efficient algorithm to effectively estimate data influences and perform Low-rank gradiEnt Similarity Search for instruction data selection. Crucially, LESS adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length instruction data. LESS first constructs a highly reusable and transferable gradient datastore with low-dimensional gradient features and then selects examples based on their similarity to few-shot examples embodying a specific capability. Experiments show that training on a LESS-selected 5% of the data can often outperform training on the full dataset across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, the selected data is highly transferable: smaller models can be leveraged to select useful data for larger models and models from different families. Our qualitative analysis shows that our method goes beyond surface form cues to identify data that exemplifies the necessary reasoning skills for the intended downstream application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoubin Yu, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in recent multimodal reasoning approaches, they are still limited in flexibility and efficiency, as these models typically process only a few fixed modality inputs and require updates to numerous parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Paiano, Stefano Martina, Carlotta Giannelli, Filippo Caruso</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of data is limited in some fields, especially for object detection tasks, where it is necessary to have correctly labeled bounding boxes around each object. A notable example of such data scarcity is found in the domain of marine biology, where it is useful to develop methods to automatically detect submarine species for environmental monitoring. To address this data limitation, the state-of-the-art machine learning strategies employ two main approaches. The first involves pretraining models on existing datasets before generalizing to the specific domain of interest. The second strategy is to create synthetic datasets specifically tailored to the target domain using methods like copy-paste techniques or ad-hoc simulators. The first strategy often faces a significant domain shift, while the second demands custom solutions crafted for the specific task. In response to these challenges, here we propose a transfer learning framework that is valid for a generic scenario. In this framework, generated images help to improve the performances of an object detector in a few-real data regime. This is achieved through a diffusion-based generative model that was pretrained on large generic datasets. With respect to the state-of-the-art, we find that it is not necessary to fine tune the generative model on the specific domain of interest. We believe that this is an important advance because it mitigates the labor-intensive task of manual labeling the images in object detection tasks. We validate our approach focusing on fishes in an underwater environment, and on the more common domain of cars in an urban setting. Our method achieves detection performance comparable to models trained on thousands of images, using only a few hundreds of input data. Our results pave the way for new generative AI-based protocols for machine learning applications in various domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Shuyu Li, Tao Zhang, Qi Wang, Pengfei Yu, Jinyang Luo, Yan Liu, Ming Xi, Kejun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapidly evolving multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) urgently require new benchmarks to uniformly evaluate their performance on understanding and textually describing music. However, due to semantic gaps between Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and human understanding, discrepancies between professionals and the public, and low precision of annotations, existing music description datasets cannot serve as benchmarks. To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music. We established the Caichong Music Annotation Platform (CaiMAP) that employs an innovative multi-person, multi-stage assurance method, and recruited both amateurs and professionals to ensure the precision of annotations and alignment with popular semantics. Utilizing this method, we built a dataset with multi-dimensional, high-precision music annotations, the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD), and carefully selected 1,000 high-quality entries to serve as the test set for MuChin. Based on MuChin, we analyzed the discrepancies between professionals and amateurs in terms of music description, and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of annotated data for fine-tuning LLMs. Ultimately, we employed MuChin to evaluate existing music understanding models on their ability to provide colloquial descriptions of music. All data related to the benchmark, along with the scoring code and detailed appendices, have been open-sourced (https://github.com/CarlWangChina/MuChin/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e Calero Valdez, Moreen Heine, Thomas Franke, Nicole Jochems, Hans-Christian Jetter, Tim Schrills</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of AI is set to profoundly reshape the future. The European Union, recognizing this impending prominence, has enacted the AI Act, regulating market access for AI-based systems. A salient feature of the Act is to guard democratic and humanistic values by focusing regulation on transparency, explainability, and the human ability to understand and control AI systems. Hereby, the EU AI Act does not merely specify technological requirements for AI systems. The EU issues a democratic call for human-centered AI systems and, in turn, an interdisciplinary research agenda for human-centered innovation in AI development. Without robust methods to assess AI systems and their effect on individuals and society, the EU AI Act may lead to repeating the mistakes of the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU and to rushed, chaotic, ad-hoc, and ambiguous implementation, causing more confusion than lending guidance. Moreover, determined research activities in Human-AI interaction will be pivotal for both regulatory compliance and the advancement of AI in a manner that is both ethical and effective. Such an approach will ensure that AI development aligns with human values and needs, fostering a technology landscape that is innovative, responsible, and an integral part of our society.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) is a spontaneous speech dataset containing 999 audio messages from real conversations on a messaging app from 100 Spanish speakers, gender balanced. Voice messages were produced in-the-wild conditions before participants were recruited, avoiding any conscious bias due to laboratory environment. Audios were labeled in valence and arousal dimensions by three non-experts and two experts, which were then combined to obtain a final label per dimension. The experts also provided an extra label corresponding to seven emotion categories. To set a baseline for future investigations using EMOVOME, we implemented emotion recognition models using both speech and audio transcriptions. For speech, we used the standard eGeMAPS feature set and support vector machines, obtaining 49.27% and 44.71% unweighted accuracy for valence and arousal respectively. For text, we fine-tuned a multilingual BERT model and achieved 61.15% and 47.43% unweighted accuracy for valence and arousal respectively. This database will significantly contribute to research on emotion recognition in the wild, while also providing a unique natural and freely accessible resource for Spanish.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Kou, Lanxiang Hu, Zhezhi He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallel decoding methods such as Jacobi decoding show promise for more efficient LLM inference as it breaks the sequential nature of the LLM decoding process and transforms it into parallelizable computation. However, in practice, it achieves little speedup compared to traditional autoregressive (AR) decoding, primarily because Jacobi decoding seldom accurately predicts more than one token in a single fixed-point iteration step. To address this, we develop a new approach aimed at realizing fast convergence from any state to the fixed point on a Jacobi trajectory. This is accomplished by refining the target LLM to consistently predict the fixed point given any state as input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing 2.4$\times$ to 3.4$\times$ improvements in generation speed while preserving generation quality across both domain-specific and open-domain benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Frisoni, Alessio Cocchieri, Alex Presepi, Gianluca Moro, Zaiqiao Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical open-domain question answering demands substantial access to specialized knowledge. Recent efforts have sought to decouple knowledge from model parameters, counteracting architectural scaling and allowing for training on common low-resource hardware. The retrieve-then-read paradigm has become ubiquitous, with model predictions grounded on relevant knowledge pieces from external repositories such as PubMed, textbooks, and UMLS. An alternative path, still under-explored but made possible by the advent of domain-specific large language models, entails constructing artificial contexts through prompting. As a result, "to generate or to retrieve" is the modern equivalent of Hamlet's dilemma. This paper presents MedGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for multiple-choice question answering in medicine. We conduct extensive experiments on MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and MMLU, incorporating a practical perspective by assuming a maximum of 24GB VRAM. MedGENIE sets a new state-of-the-art in the open-book setting of each testbed, allowing a small-scale reader to outcompete zero-shot closed-book 175B baselines while using up to 706$\times$ fewer parameters. Our findings reveal that generated passages are more effective than retrieved ones in attaining higher accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural databases for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) are scarce and often rely on staged scenarios, such as films or television shows, limiting their application in real-world contexts. We developed and publicly released the Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) database, including 999 voice messages from real conversations of 100 Spanish speakers on a messaging app, labeled in continuous and discrete emotions by expert and non-expert annotators. We evaluated speaker-independent SER models using a standard set of acoustic features and transformer-based models. We compared the results with reference databases including acted and elicited speech, and analyzed the influence of annotators and gender fairness. The pre-trained UniSpeech-SAT-Large model achieved the highest results, 61.64% and 55.57% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) for 3-class valence and arousal prediction respectively on EMOVOME, a 10% improvement over baseline models. For the emotion categories, 42.58% UA was obtained. EMOVOME performed lower than the acted RAVDESS database. The elicited IEMOCAP database also outperformed EMOVOME in predicting emotion categories, while similar results were obtained in valence and arousal. EMOVOME outcomes varied with annotator labels, showing better results and fairness when combining expert and non-expert annotations. This study highlights the gap between staged and real-life scenarios, supporting further advancements in recognizing genuine emotions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Huang, Haitian Zhong, Tao Yu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing on large language models (LLMs) has received considerable attention. Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content. Therefore, we employ more reliable data collection methods to construct a new Large $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage Model $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{B}$enchmark, $\textbf{VLKEB}$, and extend the Portability metric for more comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multi-modal knowledge graph, our image data are bound with knowledge entities. This can be further used to extract entity-related knowledge, which constitutes the base of editing data. We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models. The results reveal strengths and deficiencies of these methods and hopefully provide insights for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxi Wan, Pei Li, Arpan Kusari</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of universal function approximators in the domain of reinforcement learning, the number of practical applications leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has exploded. Decision-making in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has emerged as a chief application among them, taking the sensor data or the higher-order kinematic variables as the input and providing a discrete choice or continuous control output. There has been a continuous effort to understand the black-box nature of the DRL models, but so far, there hasn't been any discussion (to the best of authors' knowledge) about how the models learn the physical process. This presents an overwhelming limitation that restricts the real-world deployment of DRL in AVs. Therefore, in this research work, we try to decode the knowledge learnt by the attention-based DRL framework about the physical process. We use a continuous proximal policy optimization-based DRL algorithm as the baseline model and add a multi-head attention framework in an open-source AV simulation environment. We provide some analytical techniques for discussing the interpretability of the trained models in terms of explainability and causality for spatial and temporal correlations. We show that the weights in the first head encode the positions of the neighboring vehicles while the second head focuses on the leader vehicle exclusively. Also, the ego vehicle's action is causally dependent on the vehicles in the target lane spatially and temporally. Through these findings, we reliably show that these techniques can help practitioners decipher the results of the DRL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Huang, Sitao Cheng, Shanshan Huang, Jiayu Shen, Yong Xu, Chaoyun Zhang, Yuzhong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic parsing has achieved remarkable success. However, we find existing methods fall short in terms of reliability and efficiency when hallucinations are encountered. In this paper, we address these challenges with a framework called QueryAgent, which solves a question step-by-step and performs step-wise self-correction. We introduce an environmental feedback-based self-correction method called ERASER. Unlike traditional approaches, ERASER leverages rich environmental feedback in the intermediate steps to perform selective and differentiated self-correction only when necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that QueryAgent notably outperforms all previous few-shot methods using only one example on GrailQA and GraphQ by 7.0 and 15.0 F1. Moreover, our approach exhibits superiority in terms of efficiency, including runtime, query overhead, and API invocation costs. By leveraging ERASER, we further improve another baseline (i.e., AgentBench) by approximately 10 points, revealing the strong transferability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qirui Mi, Zhiyu Zhao, Siyu Xia, Yan Song, Jun Wang, Haifeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Lucas critique emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of policy changes on the expectations of micro-level agents in macroeconomic policymaking. However, the inherently self-interested nature of large-scale micro-agents, who pursue long-term benefits, complicates the formulation of optimal macroeconomic policies. This paper proposes a novel general framework named Dynamic Stackelberg Mean Field Games (Dynamic SMFG) to model such policymaking within sequential decision-making processes, with the government as the leader and households as dynamic followers. Dynamic SMFGs capture the dynamic interactions among large-scale households and their response to macroeconomic policy changes. To solve dynamic SMFGs, we propose the Stackelberg Mean Field Reinforcement Learning (SMFRL) algorithm, which leverages the population distribution of followers to represent high-dimensional joint state and action spaces. In experiments, our method surpasses macroeconomic policies in the real world, existing AI-based and economic methods. It allows the leader to approach the social optimum with the highest performance, while large-scale followers converge toward their best response to the leader's policy. Besides, we demonstrate that our approach retains effectiveness even when some households do not adopt the SMFG policy. In summary, this paper contributes to the field of AI for economics by offering an effective tool for modeling and solving macroeconomic policy-making issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Vallstrom</p>
<p>Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Wu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Teng-Yun Hsiao, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a two-stage memory retrieval dynamics for modern Hopfield models, termed $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$, with enhanced memory capacity. Our key contribution is a learnable feature map $\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield energy function into kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence between the local minima of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics within the kernel space. Consequently, the kernel norm induced by $\Phi$ serves as a novel similarity measure. It utilizes the stored memory patterns as learning data to enhance memory capacity across all modern Hopfield models. Specifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation loss $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by separating stored memory patterns in kernel space. Methodologically, $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ memory retrieval process consists of: (Stage I) minimizing separation loss for a more uniform memory (local minimum) distribution, followed by (Stage II) standard Hopfield energy minimization for memory retrieval. This results in a significant reduction of possible metastable states in the Hopfield energy function, thus enhancing memory capacity by preventing memory confusion. Empirically, with real-world datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ outperforms all existing modern Hopfield models and state-of-the-art similarity measures, achieving substantial improvements in both associative memory retrieval and deep learning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Hao Qiu, Siqi Guo, Mao Xu, Tuo Zhao, Lijun Zhang, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1.

<p>Abstract: Neural networks have increasingly influenced people's lives. Ensuring the faithful deployment of neural networks as designed by their model owners is crucial, as they may be susceptible to various malicious or unintentional modifications, such as backdooring and poisoning attacks. Fragile model watermarks aim to prevent unexpected tampering that could lead DNN models to make incorrect decisions. They ensure the detection of any tampering with the model as sensitively as possible.However, prior watermarking methods suffered from inefficient sample generation and insufficient sensitivity, limiting their practical applicability. Our approach employs a sample-pairing technique, placing the model boundaries between pairs of samples, while simultaneously maximizing logits. This ensures that the model's decision results of sensitive samples change as much as possible and the Top-1 labels easily alter regardless of the direction it moves.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Lin, Chongming Gao, Jiawei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Binbin Hu, Yan Feng, Chun Chen, Can Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommendation Systems (RS) are often plagued by popularity bias. When training a recommendation model on a typically long-tailed dataset, the model tends to not only inherit this bias but often exacerbate it, resulting in over-representation of popular items in the recommendation lists. This study conducts comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses to expose the root causes of this phenomenon, yielding two core insights: 1) Item popularity is memorized in the principal spectrum of the score matrix predicted by the recommendation model; 2) The dimension collapse phenomenon amplifies the relative prominence of the principal spectrum, thereby intensifying the popularity bias. Building on these insights, we propose a novel debiasing strategy that leverages a spectral norm regularizer to penalize the magnitude of the principal singular value. We have developed an efficient algorithm to expedite the calculation of the spectral norm by exploiting the spectral property of the score matrix. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets and three testing paradigms have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zheng, Ning Li, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Yao, Fei Liu, Ji Cheng, Qingfu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world optimization scenarios involve expensive evaluation with unknown and heterogeneous costs. Cost-aware Bayesian optimization stands out as a prominent solution in addressing these challenges. To approach the global optimum within a limited budget in a cost-efficient manner, the design of cost-aware acquisition functions (AFs) becomes a crucial step. However, traditional manual design paradigm typically requires extensive domain knowledge and involves a labor-intensive trial-and-error process. This paper introduces EvolCAF, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary computation (EC) to automatically design cost-aware AFs. Leveraging the crossover and mutation in the algorithmic space, EvolCAF offers a novel design paradigm, significantly reduces the reliance on domain expertise and model training. The designed cost-aware AF maximizes the utilization of available information from historical data, surrogate models and budget details. It introduces novel ideas not previously explored in the existing literature on acquisition function design, allowing for clear interpretations to provide insights into its behavior and decision-making process. In comparison to the well-known EIpu and EI-cool methods designed by human experts, our approach showcases remarkable efficiency and generalization across various tasks, including 12 synthetic problems and 3 real-world hyperparameter tuning test sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neo Christopher Chung, Hongkyou Chung, Hearim Lee, Lennart Brocki, Hongbeom Chung, George Dyer</p>
<p>Abstract: A cautious interpretation of AI regulations and policy in the EU and the USA place explainability as a central deliverable of compliant AI systems. However, from a technical perspective, explainable AI (XAI) remains an elusive and complex target where even state of the art methods often reach erroneous, misleading, and incomplete explanations. "Explainability" has multiple meanings which are often used interchangeably, and there are an even greater number of XAI methods - none of which presents a clear edge. Indeed, there are multiple failure modes for each XAI method, which require application-specific development and continuous evaluation. In this paper, we analyze legislative and policy developments in the United States and the European Union, such as the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, the AI Act, the AI Liability Directive, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from a right to explanation perspective. We argue that these AI regulations and current market conditions threaten effective AI governance and safety because the objective of trustworthy, accountable, and transparent AI is intrinsically linked to the questionable ability of AI operators to provide meaningful explanations. Unless governments explicitly tackle the issue of explainability through clear legislative and policy statements that take into account technical realities, AI governance risks becoming a vacuous "box-ticking" exercise where scientific standards are replaced with legalistic thresholds, providing only a false sense of security in XAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fakrul Islam Tushar, Avivah Wang, Lavsen Dahal, Michael R. Harowicz, Kyle J. Lafata, Tina D. Tailor, Joseph Y. Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung cancer's high mortality rate can be mitigated by early detection, increasingly reliant on AI for diagnostic imaging. However, AI model performance depends on training and validation datasets. This study develops and validates AI models for both nodule detection and cancer classification tasks. For detection, two models (DLCSD-mD and LUNA16-mD) were developed using the Duke Lung Cancer Screening Dataset (DLCSD), with over 2,000 CT scans from 1,613 patients and more than 3,000 annotations. These models were evaluated on internal (DLCSD) and external datasets, including LUNA16 (601 patients, 1186 nodules) and NLST (969 patients, 1192 nodules), using FROC analysis and AUC metrics. For classification, five models were developed and tested: a randomly initialized 3D ResNet50, Genesis, MedNet3D, an enhanced ResNet50 using Strategic Warm-Start++ (SWS++), and a linear classifier analyzing features from the Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers (FMCB). These models were trained to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules and evaluated using AUC analysis on internal (DLCSD) and external datasets, including LUNA16 (433 patients, 677 nodules) and NLST. The DLCSD-mD model achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.94) on the internal DLCSD dataset. External validation results were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98) on LUNA16 and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73-0.76) on NLST. For classification, the ResNet50-SWS++ model recorded AUCs of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61-0.81) on DLCSD, 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.93) on LUNA16, and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79-0.82) on NLST. Other models showed varying performance across datasets, underscoring the importance of diverse model approaches. This benchmarking establishes DLCSD as a reliable resource for lung cancer AI research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rubens O. Moraes, Levi H. S. Lelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Syntax-guided synthesis is commonly used to generate programs encoding policies. In this approach, the set of programs, that can be written in a domain-specific language defines the search space, and an algorithm searches within this space for programs that encode strong policies. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for synthesizing programmatic policies, where we search within an approximation of the language's semantic space. We hypothesized that searching in semantic spaces is more sample-efficient compared to syntax-based spaces. Our rationale is that the search is more efficient if the algorithm evaluates different agent behaviors as it searches through the space, a feature often missing in syntax-based spaces. This is because small changes in the syntax of a program often do not result in different agent behaviors. We define semantic spaces by learning a library of programs that present different agent behaviors. Then, we approximate the semantic space by defining a neighborhood function for local search algorithms, where we replace parts of the current candidate program with programs from the library. We evaluated our hypothesis in a real-time strategy game called MicroRTS. Empirical results support our hypothesis that searching in semantic spaces can be more sample-efficient than searching in syntax-based spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajat Saxena, Bruce L. McNaughton</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) refers to an agent's capability to learn from a continuous stream of data and transfer knowledge without forgetting old information. One crucial aspect of CL is forward transfer, i.e., improved and faster learning on a new task by leveraging information from prior knowledge. While this ability comes naturally to biological brains, it poses a significant challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we suggest that environmental enrichment (EE) can be used as a biological model for studying forward transfer, inspiring human-like AI development. EE refers to animal studies that enhance cognitive, social, motor, and sensory stimulation and is a model for what, in humans, is referred to as 'cognitive reserve'. Enriched animals show significant improvement in learning speed and performance on new tasks, typically exhibiting forward transfer. We explore anatomical, molecular, and neuronal changes post-EE and discuss how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used to predict neural computation changes after enriched experiences. Finally, we provide a synergistic way of combining neuroscience and AI research that paves the path toward developing AI capable of rapid and efficient new task learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Tripathi, Asim Waqas, Yasin Yilmaz, Ghulam Rasool</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing accurate machine learning models for oncology requires large-scale, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundation models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical diagnostic and pathology imaging data, medical notes, reports, records, and molecular data. It employs data preprocessing techniques and foundation models to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of these embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangqiang Ding, Xiangyu Wen, Lawrence Zhu, Yiming Li, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The results demonstrate RadarOcc's state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDAR- or camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17516">Time Elastic Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre-Fran\c{c}ois Marteau (EXPRESSION)</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shezheng Song, Shasha Li, Shan Zhao, Chengyu Wang, Xiaopeng Li, Jie Yu, Qian Wan, Jun Ma, Tianwei Yan, Wentao Ma, Xiaoguang Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) aims to understand opinions in a granular manner, advancing human-computer interaction and other fields. Traditionally, MABSA methods use a joint prediction approach to identify aspects and sentiments simultaneously. However, we argue that joint models are not always superior. Our analysis shows that joint models struggle to align relevant text tokens with image patches, leading to misalignment and ineffective image utilization.
  In contrast, a pipeline framework first identifies aspects through MATE (Multimodal Aspect Term Extraction) and then aligns these aspects with image patches for sentiment classification (MASC: Multimodal Aspect-Oriented Sentiment Classification). This method is better suited for multimodal scenarios where effective image use is crucial. We present three key observations: (a) MATE and MASC have different feature requirements, with MATE focusing on token-level features and MASC on sequence-level features; (b) the aspect identified by MATE is crucial for effective image utilization; and (c) images play a trivial role in previous MABSA methods due to high noise.
  Based on these observations, we propose a pipeline framework that first predicts the aspect and then uses translation-based alignment (TBA) to enhance multimodal semantic consistency for better image utilization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on widely used MABSA datasets Twitter-15 and Twitter-17. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the pipeline approach and its potential to provide valuable insights for future MABSA research.
  For reproducibility, the code and checkpoint will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Liu, Qianxiong Xu, Hao Miao, Sun Yang, Lingzheng Zhang, Cheng Long, Ziyue Li, Rui Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Ragab, Peiliang Gong, Emadeldeen Eldele, Wenyu Zhang, Min Wu, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Daoqiang Zhang, Xiaoli Li, Zhenghua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model pre-trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data, preserving the source domain's privacy. While SFDA is prevalent in computer vision, it remains largely unexplored in time series analysis. Existing SFDA methods, designed for visual data, struggle to capture the inherent temporal dynamics of time series, hindering adaptation performance. This paper proposes MAsk And imPUte (MAPU), a novel and effective approach for time series SFDA. MAPU addresses the critical challenge of temporal consistency by introducing a novel temporal imputation task. This task involves randomly masking time series signals and leveraging a dedicated temporal imputer to recover the original signal within the learned embedding space, bypassing the complexities of noisy raw data. Notably, MAPU is the first method to explicitly address temporal consistency in the context of time series SFDA. Additionally, it offers seamless integration with existing SFDA methods, providing greater flexibility. We further introduce E-MAPU, which incorporates evidential uncertainty estimation to address the overconfidence issue inherent in softmax predictions. To achieve that, we leverage evidential deep learning to obtain a better-calibrated pre-trained model and adapt the target encoder to map out-of-support target samples to a new feature representation closer to the source domain's support. This fosters better alignment, ultimately enhancing adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world time series datasets demonstrate that both MAPU and E-MAPU achieve significant performance gains compared to existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for tackling various time series domain adaptation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhashithe Abeysinghe, Ruhan Circi</p>
<p>Abstract: Chatbots have been an interesting application of natural language generation since its inception. With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial. Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains for example medicine and psychology are implemented rapidly. This however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses. Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations. We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations which consumed educational reports, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation. Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Pan, Rahul Shome, Lydia E. Kavraki</p>
<p>Abstract: Task and motion planning represents a powerful set of hybrid planning methods that combine reasoning over discrete task domains and continuous motion generation. Traditional reasoning necessitates task domain models and enough information to ground actions to motion planning queries. Gaps in this knowledge often arise from sources like occlusion or imprecise modeling. This work generates task and motion plans that include actions cannot be fully grounded at planning time. During execution, such an action is handled by a provided human-designed or learned closed-loop behavior. Execution combines offline planned motions and online behaviors till reaching the task goal. Failures of behaviors are fed back as constraints to find new plans. Forty real-robot trials and motivating demonstrations are performed to evaluate the proposed framework and compare against state-of-the-art. Results show faster execution time, less number of actions, and more success in problems where diverse gaps arise. The experiment data is shared for researchers to simulate these settings. The work shows promise in expanding the applicable class of realistic partially grounded problems that robots can address.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning crime predictive tools use past crime data and additional behavioral datasets to forecast future crimes. Nevertheless, these tools have been shown to suffer from unfair predictions across minority racial and ethnic groups. Current approaches to address this unfairness generally propose either pre-processing methods that mitigate the bias in the training datasets by applying corrections to crime counts based on domain knowledge or in-processing methods that are implemented as fairness regularizers to optimize for both accuracy and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that combines the power of these two approaches to increase prediction fairness. Our results show that the proposed model improves the fairness of crime predictions when compared to models with in-processing de-biasing approaches and with models without any type of bias correction, albeit at the cost of reducing accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Casas, Ben Agro, Jiageng Mao, Thomas Gilles, Alexander Cui, Thomas Li, Raquel Urtasun</p>
<p>Abstract: The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting. In our experiments, we observe that \ourmodel{} outperforms the state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 Sensor and Waymo Open Dataset by a large margin, across a broad range of metrics. Last but not least, we perform extensive ablation studies that show the value of refinement for this task, that every proposed component contributes positively to its performance, and that key design choices were made.</p>

To build on these findings, we developed an automated benchmark construction process using AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhong Zhou, Haiyang Yu, Xinghua Zhang, Rongwu Xu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to avoid responding to malicious user inputs. Unfortunately, jailbreak can circumvent safety guardrails, resulting in LLMs generating harmful content and raising concerns about LLM safety. Due to language models with intensive parameters often regarded as black boxes, the mechanisms of alignment and jailbreak are challenging to elucidate. In this paper, we employ weak classifiers to explain LLM safety through the intermediate hidden states. We first confirm that LLMs learn ethical concepts during pre-training rather than alignment and can identify malicious and normal inputs in the early layers. Alignment actually associates the early concepts with emotion guesses in the middle layers and then refines them to the specific reject tokens for safe generations. Jailbreak disturbs the transformation of early unethical classification into negative emotions. We conduct experiments on models from 7B to 70B across various model families to prove our conclusion. Overall, our paper indicates the intrinsical mechanism of LLM safety and how jailbreaks circumvent safety guardrails, offering a new perspective on LLM safety and reducing concerns.

<p>Abstract: As more and more information-rich data like video become available, utilizing multi-modal auxiliary information to enhance audio tasks has sparked widespread research interest. The recent surge in research on LLM-based audio models provides fresh perspectives for tackling audio tasks. Given that LLM can flexibly ingest multiple inputs, we propose MaLa-ASR, an LLM-based ASR model that can integrate textual keywords extracted from presentation slides to improve recognition of conference content. MaLa-ASR yields average WERs of 9.4% and 11.7% on the L95 and S95 subsets of the SlideSpeech corpus, representing a significant relative WER drop of 27.9% and 44.7% over the baseline model reported in SlideSpeech. MaLa-ASR underscores LLM's strong performance in speech tasks and the capability to integrate auxiliary information conveniently. By adding keywords to the input prompt, the biased word error rate (B-WER) reduces relatively by 46.0% and 44.2%, establishing a new SOTA on this dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Ji, Kaile Wang, Tianyi Qiu, Boyuan Chen, Jiayi Zhou, Changye Li, Hantao Lou, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit undesirable behaviors. Recent efforts have focused on aligning these models to prevent harmful generation. Despite these efforts, studies have shown that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Do alignment fine-tuning have robust effects on models, or are merely superficial? In this work, we answer this question through both theoretical and empirical means. Empirically, we demonstrate the elasticity of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Using compression theory, we formally derive that such fine-tuning process disproportionately undermines alignment compared to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We conduct experimental validations to confirm the presence of elasticity across models of varying types and sizes. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. We further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our discovery signifies the importance of taming the inherent elasticity of LLMs, thereby overcoming the resistance of LLMs to alignment finetuning.</p>

DISCO adapts the traditional Thompson Sampling algorithm by integrating it within an integer program, thereby allowing for operational cost control. Because bandit learning is often worse with high dimensional actions, we focused on building low dimensional action and context representations that were nonetheless capable of good accuracy. Additionally, we sought to build a model that preserved the relationship between price and sales, in which customers increasing their purchasing in response to lower prices ("negative price elasticity"). These aims were achieved by using radial basis functions to represent the continuous (i.e. infinite armed) action space, in combination with context embeddings extracted from a neural network. These feature representations were used within a Thompson Sampling framework to facilitate exploration, and further integrated with an integer program to allocate discount codes across ASOS's customer base. These modelling decisions result in a reward model that (a) enables pooled learning across similar actions, (b) is highly accurate, including in extrapolation, and (c) preserves the expected negative price elasticity. Through offline analysis, we show that DISCO is able to effectively enact exploration and improves its performance over time, despite the global constraint. Finally, we subjected DISCO to a rigorous online A/B test, and find that it achieves a significant improvement of >1% in average basket value, relative to the legacy systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhang, Chen Shen, Xiaosong Yuan, Shaotian Yan, Liang Xie, Wenxiao Wang, Chaochen Gu, Hao Tang, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models have exploded with an endless variety, most of the popular Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) depend on sequential visual representation, where images are converted into hundreds or thousands of tokens before being input into the Large Language Model (LLM) along with language prompts. The black-box design hinders the interpretability of visual-language models, especially regarding more complex reasoning tasks. To explore the interaction process between image and text in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce the information flow method to visualize the interaction mechanism. By analyzing the dynamic flow of the information flow, we find that the information flow appears to converge in the shallow layer. Further investigation revealed a redundancy of the image token in the shallow layer. Consequently, a truncation strategy was introduced to aggregate image tokens within these shallow layers. This approach has been validated through experiments across multiple models, yielding consistent improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Zhichun Guo, Kaiwen Dong, Xiaobao Huang, Bozhao Nan, Roshni Iyer, Xiangliang Zhang, Olaf Wiest, Wei Wang, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) with their strong task-handling capabilities have shown remarkable advancements across a spectrum of fields, moving beyond natural language understanding. However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by designing and equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. Moreover, a human-defined molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method only introduces a small number of trainable parameters while outperforming baselines on various downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Meihuizi Jia, Zhongliang Guo, Leilei Gan, Jie Fu, Yichao Feng, Fengjun Pan, Luu Anh Tuan</p>
<p>Abstract: The large language models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LMMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and attacks without fine-tuning. Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Che Liu, Zhongwei Wan, Yuqi Wang, Hui Shen, Haozhe Wang, Kangyu Zheng, Mi Zhang, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation can significantly benefit the labor-intensive process of report writing by radiologists, especially for 3D radiographs like CT scans, which are crucial for broad clinical diagnostics yet underexplored compared to 2D radiographs. Existing methods often handle 3D volumes either slice-wise or with aggressive downsampling due to current GPU memory limitations, which results in a loss of the inherent 3D nature and critical details. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel framework that efficiently and effectively generates radiology reports for high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes, based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, our framework utilizes low-resolution (LR) visual tokens as queries to mine information from HR tokens, preserving detailed HR information while reducing computational costs by only processing HR informed LR visual queries. Further benefiting the field, we curate and release BIMCV-RG, a new dataset with 5,328 HR 3D volumes and paired reports, establishing the first benchmarks for report generation from 3D HR medical images. Our method consistently surpasses existing methods on this benchmark across three different settings: normal-resolution, high-resolution inputs, and zero-shot domain transfer, all at an acceptable computational cost, trainable on a single A100-80G.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Gu, Zeyang Zhou, Kexin Huang, Dandan Liang, Yixu Wang, Haiquan Zhao, Yuanqi Yao, Xingge Qiao, Keqing Wang, Yujiu Yang, Yan Teng, Yu Qiao, Yingchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Powered by remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in manifold tasks. However, the practical application scenarios of MLLMs are intricate, exposing them to potential malicious instructions and thereby posing safety risks. While current benchmarks do incorporate certain safety considerations, they often lack comprehensive coverage and fail to exhibit the necessary rigor and robustness. For instance, the common practice of employing GPT-4V as both the evaluator and a model to be evaluated lacks credibility, as it tends to exhibit a bias toward its own responses. In this paper, we present MLLMGuard, a multidimensional safety evaluation suite for MLLMs, including a bilingual image-text evaluation dataset, inference utilities, and a lightweight evaluator. MLLMGuard's assessment comprehensively covers two languages (English and Chinese) and five important safety dimensions (Privacy, Bias, Toxicity, Truthfulness, and Legality), each with corresponding rich subtasks. Focusing on these dimensions, our evaluation dataset is primarily sourced from platforms such as social media, and it integrates text-based and image-based red teaming techniques with meticulous annotation by human experts. This can prevent inaccurate evaluation caused by data leakage when using open-source datasets and ensures the quality and challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, a fully automated lightweight evaluator termed GuardRank is developed, which achieves significantly higher evaluation accuracy than GPT-4. Our evaluation results across 13 advanced models indicate that MLLMs still have a substantial journey ahead before they can be considered safe and responsible.</p>

<p>Abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing images from fNIRS brain activity and start building a prototype to match the required specs. By training an image reconstruction model on downsampled fMRI data, we discovered that cm-scale spatial resolution is sufficient for image generation. We obtained 71% retrieval accuracy with 1-cm resolution, compared to 93% on the full-resolution fMRI, and 20% with 2-cm resolution. With simulations and high-density tomography, we found that time-domain fNIRS can achieve 1-cm resolution, compared to 2-cm resolution for continuous-wave fNIRS. Lastly, we share designs for a prototype time-domain fNIRS device, consisting of a laser driver, a single photon detector, and a time-to-digital converter system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Wenhao Li, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A carbon market is a market-based tool that incentivizes economic agents to align individual profits with the global utility, i.e., reducing carbon emissions to tackle climate change. Cap and trade stands as a critical principle based on allocating and trading carbon allowances (carbon emission credit), enabling economic agents to follow planned emissions and penalizing excess emissions. A central authority is responsible for introducing and allocating those allowances in cap and trade. However, the complexity of carbon market dynamics makes accurate simulation intractable, which in turn hinders the design of effective allocation strategies. To address this, we propose an adaptive mechanism design framework, simulating the market using hierarchical, model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Government agents allocate carbon credits, while enterprises engage in economic activities and carbon trading. This framework illustrates agents' behavior comprehensively. Numerical results show MARL enables government agents to balance productivity, equality, and carbon emissions. Our project is available at https://github.com/xwanghan/Carbon-Simulator.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07971">It Takes Two: On the Seamlessness between Reward and Policy Model in RLHF</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiming Lu, Lingfeng Shen, Xinyu Yang, Weiting Tan, Beidi Chen, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training policy models (PMs) and reward models (RMs) to align language models with human preferences. Instead of focusing solely on PMs and RMs independently, we propose to examine their interactions during fine-tuning, introducing the concept of seamlessness. Our study starts with observing the saturation phenomenon, where continual improvements in RM and PM do not translate into RLHF progress. Our analysis shows that RMs fail to assign proper scores to PM responses, resulting in a 35% mismatch rate with human preferences, highlighting a significant discrepancy between PM and RM. To measure seamlessness between PM and RM without human effort, we propose an automatic metric, SEAM. SEAM quantifies the discrepancies between PM and RM judgments induced by data samples. We validate the effectiveness of SEAM in data selection and model augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) using SEAM-filtered data for RL training improves RLHF performance by 4.5%, and (2) SEAM-guided model augmentation results in a 4% performance improvement over standard augmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niall McGuire, Dr Yashar Moshfeghi</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy searchers' Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an accuracy of 73.5% (SD 2.6%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of 90.1% (SD 22.1%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wang, Liping Chen, Kong AiK Lee, Zhen-Hua Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice anonymization has been developed as a technique for preserving privacy by replacing the speaker's voice in a speech signal with that of a pseudo-speaker, thereby obscuring the original voice attributes from machine recognition and human perception. In this paper, we focus on altering the voice attributes against machine recognition while retaining human perception. We referred to this as the asynchronous voice anonymization. To this end, a speech generation framework incorporating a speaker disentanglement mechanism is employed to generate the anonymized speech. The speaker attributes are altered through adversarial perturbation applied on the speaker embedding, while human perception is preserved by controlling the intensity of perturbation. Experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech dataset showed that the speaker attributes were obscured with their human perception preserved for 60.71% of the processed utterances.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08316">Is Programming by Example solved by LLMs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Ding Li, Kevin Ellis</p>
<p>Abstract: Programming-by-Examples (PBE) aims to generate an algorithm from input-output examples. Such systems are practically and theoretically important: from an end-user perspective, they are deployed to millions of people, and from an AI perspective, PBE corresponds to a very general form of few-shot inductive inference. Given the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code-generation tasks, we investigate here the extent to which LLMs can be said to have `solved' PBE. We experiment on classic domains such as lists and strings, and an uncommon graphics programming domain not well represented in typical pretraining data. We find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but that they can be fine-tuned for much higher performance, provided the test problems are in-distribution. We analyze empirically what causes these models to succeed and fail, and take steps toward understanding how to achieve better out-of-distribution generalization. Collectively these results suggest that LLMs make strong progress toward solving the typical suite of PBE tasks, potentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems, while also identifying ways in which LLMs still fall short.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Language Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate the emerging abilities of "world models" -- interpreting and reasoning about complex real-world dynamics. To assess these abilities, we posit videos are the ideal medium, as they encapsulate rich representations of real-world dynamics and causalities. To this end, we introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark for multi-discipline, multi-faceted multimodal video understanding. MMWorld distinguishes itself from previous video understanding benchmarks with two unique advantages: (1) multi-discipline, covering various disciplines that often require domain expertise for comprehensive understanding; (2) multi-faceted reasoning, including explanation, counterfactual thinking, future prediction, etc. MMWorld consists of a human-annotated dataset to evaluate MLLMs with questions about the whole videos and a synthetic dataset to analyze MLLMs within a single modality of perception. Together, MMWorld encompasses 1,910 videos across seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines, complete with 6,627 question-answer pairs and associated captions. The evaluation includes 2 proprietary and 10 open-source MLLMs, which struggle on MMWorld (e.g., GPT-4V performs the best with only 52.3\% accuracy), showing large room for improvement. Further ablation studies reveal other interesting findings such as models' different skill sets from humans. We hope MMWorld can serve as an essential step towards world model evaluation in videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Mandi, Yijia Weng, Dominik Bauer, Shuran Song</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Real2Code, a novel approach to reconstructing articulated objects via code generation. Given visual observations of an object, we first reconstruct its part geometry using an image segmentation model and a shape completion model. We then represent the object parts with oriented bounding boxes, which are input to a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to predict joint articulation as code. By leveraging pre-trained vision and language models, our approach scales elegantly with the number of articulated parts, and generalizes from synthetic training data to real world objects in unstructured environments. Experimental results demonstrate that Real2Code significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art in reconstruction accuracy, and is the first approach to extrapolate beyond objects' structural complexity in the training set, and reconstructs objects with up to 10 articulated parts. When incorporated with a stereo reconstruction model, Real2Code also generalizes to real world objects from a handful of multi-view RGB images, without the need for depth or camera information.</p>
