<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianke Zhang, Yanjiang Guo, Xiaoyu Chen, Yen-Jen Wang, Yucheng Hu, Chengming Shi, Jianyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05274">Scale-Invariant Object Detection by Adaptive Convolution with Unified Global-Local Context</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amrita Singh, Snehasis Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense features are important for detecting minute objects in images. Unfortunately, despite the remarkable efficacy of the CNN models in multi-scale object detection, CNN models often fail to detect smaller objects in images due to the loss of dense features during the pooling process. Atrous convolution addresses this issue by applying sparse kernels. However, sparse kernels often can lose the multi-scale detection efficacy of the CNN model. In this paper, we propose an object detection model using a Switchable (adaptive) Atrous Convolutional Network (SAC-Net) based on the efficientDet model. A fixed atrous rate limits the performance of the CNN models in the convolutional layers. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a switchable mechanism that allows for dynamically adjusting the atrous rate during the forward pass. The proposed SAC-Net encapsulates the benefits of both low-level and high-level features to achieve improved performance on multi-scale object detection tasks, without losing the dense features. Further, we apply a depth-wise switchable atrous rate to the proposed network, to improve the scale-invariant features. Finally, we apply global context on the proposed model. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAC-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Han, Salaheldin Mohamed, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advance of generative AI, the text-to-image (T2I) model has the ability to generate various contents. However, the generated contents cannot be fully controlled. There is a potential risk that T2I model can generate unsafe images with uncomfortable contents. In our work, we focus on eliminating the NSFW (not safe for work) content generation from T2I model while maintaining the high quality of generated images by fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion model via reinforcement learning by optimizing the well-designed content-safe reward function. The proposed method leverages a customized reward function consisting of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) and nudity rewards to prune the nudity contents that adhere to the pret-rained model and keep the corresponding semantic meaning on the safe side. In this way, the T2I model is robust to unsafe adversarial prompts since unsafe visual representations are mitigated from latent space. Extensive experiments conducted on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in alleviating unsafe content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images as well as images generated by unsafe prompts. We compare with five existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and achieve competitive performance on sexual content removal and image quality retention. In terms of robustness, our method outperforms counterparts under the SOTA black-box attacking model. Furthermore, our constructed method can be a benchmark for anti-NSFW generation with semantically-relevant safe alignment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05322">Noise Crystallization and Liquid Noise: Zero-shot Video Generation using Image Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Haaris Khan, Hadrien Reynaud, Bernhard Kainz</p>
<p>Abstract: Although powerful for image generation, consistent and controllable video is a longstanding problem for diffusion models. Video models require extensive training and computational resources, leading to high costs and large environmental impacts. Moreover, video models currently offer limited control of the output motion. This paper introduces a novel approach to video generation by augmenting image diffusion models to create sequential animation frames while maintaining fine detail. These techniques can be applied to existing image models without training any video parameters (zero-shot) by altering the input noise in a latent diffusion model. Two complementary methods are presented. Noise crystallization ensures consistency but is limited to large movements due to reduced latent embedding sizes. Liquid noise trades consistency for greater flexibility without resolution limitations. The core concepts also allow other applications such as relighting, seamless upscaling, and improved video style transfer. Furthermore, an exploration of the VAE embedding used for latent diffusion models is performed, resulting in interesting theoretical insights such as a method for human-interpretable latent spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuto Haneji, Taichi Nishimura, Hirotaka Kameko, Keisuke Shirai, Tomoya Yoshida, Keiya Kajimura, Koki Yamamoto, Taiyu Cui, Tomohiro Nishimoto, Shinsuke Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: Mistake action detection from egocentric videos is crucial for developing intelligent archives that detect workers' errors and provide feedback. Previous studies have been limited to specific domains, focused on detecting mistakes from videos without procedural texts, and analyzed whether actions are mistakes. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the EgoOops dataset, which includes egocentric videos, procedural texts, and three types of annotations: video-text alignment, mistake labels, and descriptions for mistakes. EgoOops covers five procedural domains and includes 50 egocentric videos. The video-text alignment allows the model to detect mistakes based on both videos and procedural texts. The mistake labels and descriptions enable detailed analysis of real-world mistakes. Based on EgoOops, we tackle two tasks: video-text alignment and mistake detection. For video-text alignment, we enhance the recent StepFormer model with an additional loss for fine-tuning. Based on the alignment results, we propose a multi-modal classifier to predict mistake labels. In our experiments, the proposed methods achieve higher performance than the baselines. In addition, our ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining videos and texts. We will release the dataset and codes upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanqing Meng, Jiaqi Liao, Xinyu Tan, Wenqi Shao, Quanfeng Lu, Kaipeng Zhang, Yu Cheng, Dianqi Li, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models like Sora have made significant strides in visualizing complex prompts, which is increasingly viewed as a promising path towards constructing the universal world simulator. Cognitive psychologists believe that the foundation for achieving this goal is the ability to understand intuitive physics. However, the capacity of these models to accurately represent intuitive physics remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhyGenBench, a comprehensive \textbf{Phy}sics \textbf{Gen}eration \textbf{Ben}chmark designed to evaluate physical commonsense correctness in T2V generation. PhyGenBench comprises 160 carefully crafted prompts across 27 distinct physical laws, spanning four fundamental domains, which could comprehensively assesses models' understanding of physical commonsense. Alongside PhyGenBench, we propose a novel evaluation framework called PhyGenEval. This framework employs a hierarchical evaluation structure utilizing appropriate advanced vision-language models and large language models to assess physical commonsense. Through PhyGenBench and PhyGenEval, we can conduct large-scale automated assessments of T2V models' understanding of physical commonsense, which align closely with human feedback. Our evaluation results and in-depth analysis demonstrate that current models struggle to generate videos that comply with physical commonsense. Moreover, simply scaling up models or employing prompt engineering techniques is insufficient to fully address the challenges presented by PhyGenBench (e.g., dynamic scenarios). We hope this study will inspire the community to prioritize the learning of physical commonsense in these models beyond entertainment applications. We will release the data and codes at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PhyGenBench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrdad Shafiei Dizaji</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Twins technology is revolutionizing decision-making in scientific research by integrating models and simulations with real-time data. Unlike traditional Structural Health Monitoring methods, which rely on computationally intensive Digital Image Correlation and have limitations in real-time data integration, this research proposes a novel approach using Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks are employed to analyze structural behaviors in real-time by correlating Digital Image Correlation speckle pattern images with deformation fields. Initially focusing on two-dimensional speckle patterns, the research extends to three-dimensional applications using stereo-paired images for comprehensive deformation analysis. This method overcomes computational challenges by utilizing a mix of synthetically generated and authentic speckle pattern images for training the Convolutional Neural Networks. The models are designed to be robust and versatile, offering a promising alternative to traditional measurement techniques and paving the way for advanced applications in three-dimensional modeling. This advancement signifies a shift towards more efficient and dynamic structural health monitoring by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence for real-time simulation and analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Elezabi, Zongwei Wu, Radu Timofte</p>
<p>Abstract: Image super-resolution methods have made significant strides with deep learning techniques and ample training data. However, they face challenges due to inherent misalignment between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) pairs in real-world datasets. In this study, we propose a novel plug-and-play module designed to mitigate these misalignment issues by aligning LR inputs with HR images during training. Specifically, our approach involves mimicking a novel LR sample that aligns with HR while preserving the degradation characteristics of the original LR samples. This module seamlessly integrates with any SR model, enhancing robustness against misalignment. Importantly, it can be easily removed during inference, therefore without introducing any parameters on the conventional SR models. We comprehensively evaluate our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across a spectrum of SR models, including traditional CNNs and state-of-the-art Transformers.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05436">Discovering distinctive elements of biomedical datasets for high-performance exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Tauhidul Islam, Lei Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: The human brain represents an object by small elements and distinguishes two objects based on the difference in elements. Discovering the distinctive elements of high-dimensional datasets is therefore critical in numerous perception-driven biomedical and clinical studies. However, currently there is no available method for reliable extraction of distinctive elements of high-dimensional biomedical and clinical datasets. Here we present an unsupervised deep learning technique namely distinctive element analysis (DEA), which extracts the distinctive data elements using high-dimensional correlative information of the datasets. DEA at first computes a large number of distinctive parts of the data, then filters and condenses the parts into DEA elements by employing a unique kernel-driven triple-optimization network. DEA has been found to improve the accuracy by up to 45% in comparison to the traditional techniques in applications such as disease detection from medical images, gene ranking and cell recognition from single cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) datasets. Moreover, DEA allows user-guided manipulation of the intermediate calculation process and thus offers intermediate results with better interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadush Hailu Gebrerufael, Anil Kumar Tiwari, Gaurav Neupane</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal deep metric learning is crucial for effectively capturing diverse representations in tasks such as face verification, fine-grained object recognition, and product search. Traditional approaches to metric learning, whether based on distance or margin metrics, primarily emphasize class separation, often overlooking the intra-class distribution essential for multi-modal feature learning. In this context, we propose a novel loss function called Density-Aware Adaptive Margin Loss(DAAL), which preserves the density distribution of embeddings while encouraging the formation of adaptive sub-clusters within each class. By employing an adaptive line strategy, DAAL not only enhances intra-class variance but also ensures robust inter-class separation, facilitating effective multi-modal representation. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark fine-grained datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DAAL, underscoring its potential in advancing retrieval applications and multi-modal deep metric learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mangroves are dynamic coastal ecosystems that are crucial to environmental health, economic stability, and climate resilience. The monitoring and preservation of mangroves are of global importance, with remote sensing technologies playing a pivotal role in these efforts. The integration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence with satellite data opens new avenues for ecological monitoring, potentially revolutionizing conservation strategies at a time when the protection of natural resources is more crucial than ever. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of recent deep-learning models on the task of mangrove segmentation. We first introduce and make available a novel open-source dataset, MagSet-2, incorporating mangrove annotations from the Global Mangrove Watch and satellite images from Sentinel-2, from mangrove positions all over the world. We then benchmark three architectural groups, namely convolutional, transformer, and mamba models, using the created dataset. The experimental outcomes further validate the deep learning community's interest in the Mamba model, which surpasses other architectures in all metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety disorders affect millions globally, contributing significantly to the burden of mental health issues. Early screening is crucial for effective intervention, as timely identification of mental health issues can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable for improving the screening of mental disorders, enabling early intervention and better treatment outcomes. AI-driven screening can leverage the analysis of multiple data sources, including facial features in digital images. However, existing methods often rely on controlled environments or specialized equipment, limiting their broad applicability. This study explores the potential of AI models for ubiquitous depression-anxiety screening given face-centric selfies. The investigation focuses on high-risk pregnant patients, a population that is particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. To cope with limited training data resulting from our clinical setup, pre-trained models were utilized in two different approaches: fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) originally designed for facial expression recognition and employing vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of facial expressions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed VLM-based method significantly outperforms CNNs, achieving an accuracy of 77.6% and an F1-score of 56.0%. Although there is significant room for improvement, the results suggest that VLMs can be a promising approach for mental health screening, especially in scenarios with limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid increase in deepfake technology has raised significant concerns about digital media integrity. Detecting deepfakes is crucial for safeguarding digital media. However, most standard image classifiers fail to distinguish between fake and real faces. Our analysis reveals that this failure is due to the model's inability to explicitly focus on the artefacts typically in deepfakes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanhao Sun, Thanos Triantafyllou, Anthos Makris, Maja Drma\v{c}, Kai Xu, Luo Mai, Mahesh K. Marina</p>
<p>Abstract: View synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated impressive fidelity in rendering real-world scenarios. However, practical methods for accurate and efficient epistemic Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in view synthesis are lacking. Existing approaches for NeRF either introduce significant computational overhead (e.g., ``10x increase in training time" or ``10x repeated training") or are limited to specific uncertainty conditions or models. Notably, GS models lack any systematic approach for comprehensive epistemic UQ. This capability is crucial for improving the robustness and scalability of neural view synthesis, enabling active model updates, error estimation, and scalable ensemble modeling based on uncertainty. In this paper, we revisit NeRF and GS-based methods from a function approximation perspective, identifying key differences and connections in 3D representation learning. Building on these insights, we introduce PH-Dropout (Post hoc Dropout), the first real-time and accurate method for epistemic uncertainty estimation that operates directly on pre-trained NeRF and GS models. Extensive evaluations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of PH-Dropout.</p>

<p>Abstract: The outstanding performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has made them widely applied in vision-related tasks. However, various corruptions in the real world mean that images will not be as ideal as in simulations, presenting significant challenges for the practical application of LMMs. To address this issue, we introduce R-Bench, a benchmark focused on the **Real-world Robustness of LMMs**. Specifically, we: (a) model the complete link from user capture to LMMs reception, comprising 33 corruption dimensions, including 7 steps according to the corruption sequence, and 7 groups based on low-level attributes; (b) collect reference/distorted image dataset before/after corruption, including 2,970 question-answer pairs with human labeling; (c) propose comprehensive evaluation for absolute/relative robustness and benchmark 20 mainstream LMMs. Results show that while LMMs can correctly handle the original reference images, their performance is not stable when faced with distorted images, and there is a significant gap in robustness compared to the human visual system. We hope that R-Bench will inspire improving the robustness of LMMs, **extending them from experimental simulations to the real-world application**.

<p>Abstract: QR codes have become ubiquitous in daily life, enabling rapid information exchange. With the increasing adoption of smart wearable devices, there is a need for efficient, and friction-less QR code reading capabilities from Egocentric point-of-views. However, adapting existing phone-based QR code readers to egocentric images poses significant challenges. Code reading from egocentric images bring unique challenges such as wide field-of-view, code distortion and lack of visual feedback as compared to phones where users can adjust the position and framing. Furthermore, wearable devices impose constraints on resources like compute, power and memory. To address these challenges, we present EgoQR, a novel system for reading QR codes from egocentric images, and is well suited for deployment on wearable devices. Our approach consists of two primary components: detection and decoding, designed to operate on high-resolution images on the device with minimal power consumption and added latency. The detection component efficiently locates potential QR codes within the image, while our enhanced decoding component extracts and interprets the encoded information. We incorporate innovative techniques to handle the specific challenges of egocentric imagery, such as varying perspectives, wider field of view, and motion blur. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of egocentric images, demonstrating 34% improvement in reading the code compared to an existing state of the art QR code readers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ray Congrui Yu, Sherry Wu, Jiang Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the strong performance in many computer vision tasks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can sometimes struggle to efficiently capture long-range, complex non-linear dependencies in deeper layers of the network. We address this limitation by introducing Residual KAN, which incorporates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) within the CNN framework as a residual component. Our approach uses Chebyshev polynomials as the basis for KAN convolutions that enables more expressive and adaptive feature representations while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed RKAN blocks, when integrated into established architectures such as ResNet and DenseNet, offer consistent improvements over the baseline models on various well-known benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the potential of RKAN to enhance the capabilities of deep CNNs in visual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Liao, Binbin Xu, Steven L. Waslander</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-level mapping builds a 3D map of objects in a scene with detailed shapes and poses from multi-view sensor observations. Conventional methods struggle to build complete shapes and estimate accurate poses due to partial occlusions and sensor noise. They require dense observations to cover all objects, which is challenging to achieve in robotics trajectories. Recent work introduces generative shape priors for object-level mapping from sparse views, but is limited to single-category objects. In this work, we propose a General Object-level Mapping system, GOM, which leverages a 3D diffusion model as shape prior with multi-category support and outputs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for both texture and geometry for all objects in a scene. GOM includes an effective formulation to guide a pre-trained diffusion model with extra nonlinear constraints from sensor measurements without finetuning. We also develop a probabilistic optimization formulation to fuse multi-view sensor observations and diffusion priors for joint 3D object pose and shape estimation. Our GOM system demonstrates superior multi-category mapping performance from sparse views, and achieves more accurate mapping results compared to state-of-the-art methods on the real-world benchmarks. We will release our code: https://github.com/TRAILab/GeneralObjectMapping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae Shin Yoon, Zhixin Shu, Mengwei Ren, Xuaner Zhang, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Krishna Kumar Singh, He Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a high-fidelity portrait shadow removal model that can effectively enhance the image of a portrait by predicting its appearance under disturbing shadows and highlights. Portrait shadow removal is a highly ill-posed problem where multiple plausible solutions can be found based on a single image. While existing works have solved this problem by predicting the appearance residuals that can propagate local shadow distribution, such methods are often incomplete and lead to unnatural predictions, especially for portraits with hard shadows. We overcome the limitations of existing local propagation methods by formulating the removal problem as a generation task where a diffusion model learns to globally rebuild the human appearance from scratch as a condition of an input portrait image. For robust and natural shadow removal, we propose to train the diffusion model with a compositional repurposing framework: a pre-trained text-guided image generation model is first fine-tuned to harmonize the lighting and color of the foreground with a background scene by using a background harmonization dataset; and then the model is further fine-tuned to generate a shadow-free portrait image via a shadow-paired dataset. To overcome the limitation of losing fine details in the latent diffusion model, we propose a guided-upsampling network to restore the original high-frequency details (wrinkles and dots) from the input image. To enable our compositional training framework, we construct a high-fidelity and large-scale dataset using a lightstage capturing system and synthetic graphics simulation. Our generative framework effectively removes shadows caused by both self and external occlusions while maintaining original lighting distribution and high-frequency details. Our method also demonstrates robustness to diverse subjects captured in real environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Renhe Jiang, Xuan Song, Yinqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) poses a significant challenge in computer vision. A prevailing approach is to prompt models to concentrate on causal attributes, like facial features and hairstyles, rather than confounding elements such as clothing appearance. Traditional methods to achieve this involve integrating multi-modality data or employing manually annotated clothing labels, which tend to complicate the model and require extensive human effort. In our study, we demonstrate that simply reducing feature correlations during training can significantly enhance the baseline model's performance. We theoretically elucidate this effect and introduce a novel regularization technique based on density ratio estimation. This technique aims to minimize feature correlation in the training process of cloth-changing ReID baselines. Our approach is model-independent, offering broad enhancements without needing additional data or labels. We validate our method through comprehensive experiments on prevalent CC-ReID datasets, showing its effectiveness in improving baseline models' generalization capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05557">Rethinking Weak-to-Strong Augmentation in Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuzheng Yang, Song Tang, Yangkuiyi Zhang, Shuaifeng Li, Mao Ye, Jianwei Zhang, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Source-Free domain adaptive Object Detection (SFOD) aims to transfer a detector (pre-trained on source domain) to new unlabelled target domains. Current SFOD methods typically follow the Mean Teacher framework, where weak-to-strong augmentation provides diverse and sharp contrast for self-supervised learning. However, this augmentation strategy suffers from an inherent problem called crucial semantics loss: Due to random, strong disturbance, strong augmentation is prone to losing typical visual components, hindering cross-domain feature extraction. To address this thus-far ignored limitation, this paper introduces a novel Weak-to-Strong Contrastive Learning (WSCoL) approach. The core idea is to distill semantics lossless knowledge in the weak features (from the weak/teacher branch) to guide the representation learning upon the strong features (from the strong/student branch). To achieve this, we project the original features into a shared space using a mapping network, thereby reducing the bias between the weak and strong features. Meanwhile, a weak features-guided contrastive learning is performed in a weak-to-strong manner alternatively. Specifically, we first conduct an adaptation-aware prototype-guided clustering on the weak features to generate pseudo labels for corresponding strong features matched through proposals. Sequentially, we identify positive-negative samples based on the pseudo labels and perform cross-category contrastive learning on the strong features where an uncertainty estimator encourages adaptive background contrast. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WSCoL yields new state-of-the-art performance, offering a built-in mechanism mitigating crucial semantics loss for traditional Mean Teacher framework. The code and data will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD), aiming to identify and localise the objects in underwater images or videos, presents significant challenges due to the optical distortion, water turbidity, and changing illumination in underwater scenes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods, especially deep learning methods, have shown promising performance in UOD. To further facilitate future advancements, we comprehensively study AI-based UOD. In this survey, we first categorise existing algorithms into traditional machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods, and summarise them by considering learning strategy, experimental dataset, utilised features or frameworks, and learning stage. Next, we discuss the potential challenges and suggest possible solutions and new directions. We also perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mainstream algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets by considering the diverse and biased experimental setups. Finally, we introduce two off-the-shelf detection analysis tools, Diagnosis and TIDE, which well-examine the effects of object characteristics and various types of errors on detectors. These tools help identify the strengths and weaknesses of detectors, providing insigts for further improvement. The source codes, trained models, utilised datasets, detection results, and detection analysis tools are public available at \url{https://github.com/LongChenCV/UODReview}, and will be regularly updated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihan Xu, Paul Pu Liang, Haven Kim, Julian McAuley, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Hao-Wen Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Teasers are an effective tool for promoting content in entertainment, commercial and educational fields. However, creating an effective teaser for long videos is challenging for it requires long-range multimodal modeling on the input videos, while necessitating maintaining audiovisual alignments, managing scene changes and preserving factual accuracy for the output teasers. Due to the lack of a publicly-available dataset, progress along this research direction has been hindered. In this work, we present DocumentaryNet, a collection of 1,269 documentaries paired with their teasers, featuring multimodal data streams of video, speech, music, sound effects and narrations. With DocumentaryNet, we propose a new two-stage system for generating teasers from long documentaries. The proposed TeaserGen system first generates the teaser narration from the transcribed narration of the documentary using a pretrained large language model, and then selects the most relevant visual content to accompany the generated narration through language-vision models. For narration-video matching, we explore two approaches: a pretraining-based model using pretrained contrastive language-vision models and a deep sequential model that learns the mapping between the narrations and visuals. Our experimental results show that the pretraining-based approach is more effective at identifying relevant visual content than directly trained deep autoregressive models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in customizing text-to-image and video generation models, generating images and videos that effectively integrate multiple personalized concepts remains a challenging task. To address this, we present TweedieMix, a novel method for composing customized diffusion models during the inference phase. By analyzing the properties of reverse diffusion sampling, our approach divides the sampling process into two stages. During the initial steps, we apply a multiple object-aware sampling technique to ensure the inclusion of the desired target objects. In the later steps, we blend the appearances of the custom concepts in the de-noised image space using Tweedie's formula. Our results demonstrate that TweedieMix can generate multiple personalized concepts with higher fidelity than existing methods. Moreover, our framework can be effortlessly extended to image-to-video diffusion models, enabling the generation of videos that feature multiple personalized concepts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Guo, Tao Dai, Zhihao Ouyang, Taolin Zhang, Yaohua Zha, Bin Chen, Shu-tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based Large Restoration Models (LRMs) have significantly improved photo-realistic image restoration by leveraging the internal knowledge embedded within model weights. However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05624">Remote Sensing Image Segmentation Using Vision Mamba and Multi-Scale Multi-Frequency Feature Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yice Cao, Chenchen Liu, Zhenhua Wu, Wenxin Yao, Liu Xiong, Jie Chen, Zhixiang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As remote sensing imaging technology continues to advance and evolve, processing high-resolution and diversified satellite imagery to improve segmentation accuracy and enhance interpretation efficiency emerg as a pivotal area of investigation within the realm of remote sensing. Although segmentation algorithms based on CNNs and Transformers achieve significant progress in performance, balancing segmentation accuracy and computational complexity remains challenging, limiting their wide application in practical tasks. To address this, this paper introduces state space model (SSM) and proposes a novel hybrid semantic segmentation network based on vision Mamba (CVMH-UNet). This method designs a cross-scanning visual state space block (CVSSBlock) that uses cross 2D scanning (CS2D) to fully capture global information from multiple directions, while by incorporating convolutional neural network branches to overcome the constraints of Vision Mamba (VMamba) in acquiring local information, this approach facilitates a comprehensive analysis of both global and local features. Furthermore, to address the issue of limited discriminative power and the difficulty in achieving detailed fusion with direct skip connections, a multi-frequency multi-scale feature fusion block (MFMSBlock) is designed. This module introduces multi-frequency information through 2D discrete cosine transform (2D DCT) to enhance information utilization and provides additional scale local detail information through point-wise convolution branches. Finally, it aggregates multi-scale information along the channel dimension, achieving refined feature fusion. Findings from experiments conducted on renowned datasets of remote sensing imagery demonstrate that proposed CVMH-UNet achieves superior segmentation performance while maintaining low computational complexity, outperforming surpassing current leading-edge segmentation algorithms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05627">CLOSER: Towards Better Representation Learning for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junghun Oh, Sungyong Baik, Kyoung Mu Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Aiming to incrementally learn new classes with only few samples while preserving the knowledge of base (old) classes, few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) faces several challenges, such as overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Such a challenging problem is often tackled by fixing a feature extractor trained on base classes to reduce the adverse effects of overfitting and forgetting. Under such formulation, our primary focus is representation learning on base classes to tackle the unique challenge of FSCIL: simultaneously achieving the transferability and the discriminability of the learned representation. Building upon the recent efforts for enhancing transferability, such as promoting the spread of features, we find that trying to secure the spread of features within a more confined feature space enables the learned representation to strike a better balance between transferability and discriminability. Thus, in stark contrast to prior beliefs that the inter-class distance should be maximized, we claim that the closer different classes are, the better for FSCIL. The empirical results and analysis from the perspective of information bottleneck theory justify our simple yet seemingly counter-intuitive representation learning method, raising research questions and suggesting alternative research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Guo, Jingyu Liu, Mingda Li, Xiaoying Tang, Qingbin Liu, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05650">SIA-OVD: Shape-Invariant Adapter for Bridging the Image-Region Gap in Open-Vocabulary Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishuo Wang, Wenhao Zhou, Jinglin Xu, Yuxin Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) aims to detect novel objects without instance-level annotations to achieve open-world object detection at a lower cost. Existing OVD methods mainly rely on the powerful open-vocabulary image-text alignment capability of Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLM) such as CLIP. However, CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and lacks the perceptual ability for local regions within an image, resulting in the gap between image and region representations. Directly using CLIP for OVD causes inaccurate region classification. We find the image-region gap is primarily caused by the deformation of region feature maps during region of interest (RoI) extraction. To mitigate the inaccurate region classification in OVD, we propose a new Shape-Invariant Adapter named SIA-OVD to bridge the image-region gap in the OVD task. SIA-OVD learns a set of feature adapters for regions with different shapes and designs a new adapter allocation mechanism to select the optimal adapter for each region. The adapted region representations can align better with text representations learned by CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIA-OVD effectively improves the classification accuracy for regions by addressing the gap between images and regions caused by shape deformation. SIA-OVD achieves substantial improvements over representative methods on the COCO-OVD benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/SIA-OVD_ACMMM2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serin Yang, Taesung Kwon, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start & end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</p>

<p>Abstract: As text-to-image diffusion models become advanced enough for commercial applications, there is also increasing concern about their potential for malicious and harmful use. Model unlearning has been proposed to mitigate the concerns by removing undesired and potentially harmful information from the pre-trained model. So far, the success of unlearning is mainly measured by whether the unlearned model can generate a target concept while maintaining image quality. However, unlearning is typically tested under limited scenarios, and the side effects of unlearning have barely been studied in the current literature. In this work, we thoroughly analyze unlearning under various scenarios with five key aspects. Our investigation reveals that every method has side effects or limitations, especially in more complex and realistic situations. By releasing our comprehensive evaluation framework with the source codes and artifacts, we hope to inspire further research in this area, leading to more reliable and effective unlearning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery has created immense opportunities for various applications. However, processing and analyzing such vast amounts of data in a timely and accurate manner poses significant challenges. The paper presents a new satellite image processing architecture combining edge and cloud computing to better identify man-made structures against natural landscapes. By employing lightweight models at the edge, the system initially identifies potential man-made structures from satellite imagery. These identified images are then transmitted to the cloud, where a more complex model refines the classification, determining specific types of structures. The primary focus is on the trade-off between latency and accuracy, as efficient models often sacrifice accuracy. We compare this hybrid edge-cloud approach against traditional "bent-pipe" method in virtual environment experiments as well as introduce a practical model and compare its performance with existing lightweight models for edge deployment, focusing on accuracy and latency. The results demonstrate that the edge-cloud collaborative model not only reduces overall latency due to minimized data transmission but also maintains high accuracy, offering substantial improvements over traditional approaches under this scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on enhancing a diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) model during the post-training phase by distilling a highly capable consistency model from a pretrained T2V model. Our proposed method, T2V-Turbo-v2, introduces a significant advancement by integrating various supervision signals, including high-quality training data, reward model feedback, and conditional guidance, into the consistency distillation process. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we highlight the crucial importance of tailoring datasets to specific learning objectives and the effectiveness of learning from diverse reward models for enhancing both the visual quality and text-video alignment. Additionally, we highlight the vast design space of conditional guidance strategies, which centers on designing an effective energy function to augment the teacher ODE solver. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by extracting motion guidance from the training datasets and incorporating it into the ODE solver, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the motion quality of the generated videos with the improved motion-related metrics from VBench and T2V-CompBench. Empirically, our T2V-Turbo-v2 establishes a new state-of-the-art result on VBench, with a Total score of 85.13, surpassing proprietary systems such as Gen-3 and Kling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> June Suk Choi, Kyungmin Lee, Jongheon Jeong, Saining Xie, Jinwoo Shin, Kimin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have introduced a new era of text-guided image manipulation, enabling users to create realistic edited images with simple textual prompts. However, there is significant concern about the potential misuse of these methods, especially in creating misleading or harmful content. Although recent defense strategies, which introduce imperceptible adversarial noise to induce model failure, have shown promise, they remain ineffective against more sophisticated manipulations, such as editing with a mask. In this work, we propose DiffusionGuard, a robust and effective defense method against unauthorized edits by diffusion-based image editing models, even in challenging setups. Through a detailed analysis of these models, we introduce a novel objective that generates adversarial noise targeting the early stage of the diffusion process. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of adversarial noises. We also introduce a mask-augmentation technique to enhance robustness against various masks during test time. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of methods in protecting against privacy threats in realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves stronger protection and improved mask robustness with lower computational costs compared to the strongest baseline.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Stefanache, Llu\'is Pastor P\'erez, Julen Costa Watanabe, Ernesto Sanchez Tejedor, Thomas Hofmann, Enis Simsar</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating diffusion-based image-editing models is a crucial task in the field of Generative AI. Specifically, it is imperative to assess their capacity to execute diverse editing tasks while preserving the image content and realism. While recent developments in generative models have opened up previously unheard-of possibilities for image editing, conducting a thorough evaluation of these models remains a challenging and open task. The absence of a standardized evaluation benchmark, primarily due to the inherent need for a post-edit reference image for evaluation, further complicates this issue. Currently, evaluations often rely on established models such as CLIP or require human intervention for a comprehensive understanding of the performance of these image editing models. Our benchmark, PixLens, provides a comprehensive evaluation of both edit quality and latent representation disentanglement, contributing to the advancement and refinement of existing methodologies in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi-Yuan Hu, Yiwu Zhong, Shijia Huang, Michael R. Lyu, Liwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on video-and-language tasks, such as video question answering. However, most existing Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to struggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we propose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling through a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating mechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to achieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive evaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass, and NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the existing Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the performance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Xuanchen (Willow),  Liu, Shuxin Qiao, Kyle Gao, Hongjie He, Michael A. Chapman, Linlin Xu, Jonathan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This research addresses the need for high-definition (HD) maps for autonomous vehicles (AVs), focusing on road lane information derived from aerial imagery. While Earth observation data offers valuable resources for map creation, specialized models for road lane extraction are still underdeveloped in remote sensing. In this study, we perform an extensive comparison of twelve foundational deep learning-based semantic segmentation models for road lane marking extraction from high-definition remote sensing images, assessing their performance under transfer learning with partially labeled datasets. These models were fine-tuned on the partially labeled Waterloo Urban Scene dataset, and pre-trained on the SkyScapes dataset, simulating a likely scenario of real-life model deployment under partial labeling. We observed and assessed the fine-tuning performance and overall performance. Models showed significant performance improvements after fine-tuning, with mean IoU scores ranging from 33.56% to 76.11%, and recall ranging from 66.0% to 98.96%. Transformer-based models outperformed convolutional neural networks, emphasizing the importance of model pre-training and fine-tuning in enhancing HD map development for AV navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sisir Dhakal, Sujan Sigdel, Sandesh Prasad Paudel, Sharad Kumar Ranabhat, Nabin Lamichhane</p>
<p>Abstract: Transforming text-based identity documents, such as Nepali citizenship cards, into a structured digital format poses several challenges due to the distinct characteristics of the Nepali script and minor variations in print alignment and contrast across different cards. This work proposes a robust system using YOLOv8 for accurate text object detection and an OCR algorithm based on Optimized PyTesseract. The system, implemented within the context of a mobile application, allows for the automated extraction of important textual information from both the front and the back side of Nepali citizenship cards, including names, citizenship numbers, and dates of birth. The final YOLOv8 model was accurate, with a mean average precision of 99.1% for text detection on the front and 96.1% on the back. The tested PyTesseract optimized for Nepali characters outperformed the standard OCR regarding flexibility and accuracy, extracting text from images with clean and noisy backgrounds and various contrasts. Using preprocessing steps such as converting the images into grayscale, removing noise from the images, and detecting edges further improved the system's OCR accuracy, even for low-quality photos. This work expands the current body of research in multilingual OCR and document analysis, especially for low-resource languages such as Nepali. It emphasizes the effectiveness of combining the latest object detection framework with OCR models that have been fine-tuned for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyang Kang, Zhaoliang Luan, Kourosh Khoshelham, Bing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration is a foundational task for 3D alignment and reconstruction applications. While both traditional and learning-based registration approaches have succeeded, leveraging the intrinsic symmetry of point cloud data, including rotation equivariance, has received insufficient attention. This prohibits the model from learning effectively, resulting in a requirement for more training data and increased model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a graph neural network model embedded with a local Spherical Euclidean 3D equivariance property through SE(3) message passing based propagation. Our model is composed mainly of a descriptor module, equivariant graph layers, match similarity, and the final regression layers. Such modular design enables us to utilize sparsely sampled input points and initialize the descriptor by self-trained or pre-trained geometric feature descriptors easily. Experiments conducted on the 3DMatch and KITTI datasets exhibit the compelling and robust performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while the model complexity remains relatively low at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Chang, Hao Ai, Tianzhu Zhang, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoramic images provide comprehensive scene information and are suitable for VR applications. Obtaining corresponding depth maps is essential for achieving immersive and interactive experiences. However, panoramic depth estimation presents significant challenges due to the severe distortion caused by equirectangular projection (ERP) and the limited availability of panoramic RGB-D datasets. Inspired by the recent success of neural rendering, we propose a novel method, named $\mathbf{CUBE360}$, that learns a cubic field composed of multiple MPIs from a single panoramic image for $\mathbf{continuous}$ depth estimation at any view direction. Our CUBE360 employs cubemap projection to transform an ERP image into six faces and extract the MPIs for each, thereby reducing the memory consumption required for MPI processing of high-resolution data. Additionally, this approach avoids the computational complexity of handling the uneven pixel distribution inherent to equirectangular projectio. An attention-based blending module is then employed to learn correlations among the MPIs of cubic faces, constructing a cubic field representation with color and density information at various depth levels. Furthermore, a novel sampling strategy is introduced for rendering novel views from the cubic field at both cubic and planar scales. The entire pipeline is trained using photometric loss calculated from rendered views within a self-supervised learning approach, enabling training on 360 videos without depth annotations. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CUBE360 compared to prior SSL methods. We also highlight its effectiveness in downstream applications, such as VR roaming and visual effects, underscoring CUBE360's potential to enhance immersive experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of deep learning, specialized models have driven significant advancements in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, this specialization leads to a fragmented ecosystem where models lack the adaptability for broader applications. To overcome this, we introduce AutoFusion, an innovative framework that fuses distinct model parameters(with the same architecture) for multi-task learning without pre-trained checkpoints. Using an unsupervised, end-to-end approach, AutoFusion dynamically permutes model parameters at each layer, optimizing the combination through a loss-minimization process that does not require labeled data. We validate AutoFusion's effectiveness through experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over established methods like Weight Interpolation, Git Re-Basin, and ZipIt. Our framework offers a scalable and flexible solution for model integration, positioning it as a powerful tool for future research and practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Hung Yeh, Kuang-Huei Lee, Jun-Cheng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with user preferences has been a key challenge. Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the average aesthetics scores for text-to-image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Gao, Xuetao Li, Jiabao Wang, Shengheng Ma, Jun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of steel materials, metallographic analysis has become increasingly important. Unfortunately, grain size analysis is a manual process that requires experts to evaluate metallographic photographs, which is unreliable and time-consuming. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel classifi-cation method based on deep learning, namely GSNets, a family of hybrid models which can effectively introduce guided self-attention for classifying grain size. Concretely, we build our models from three insights:(1) Introducing our novel guided self-attention module can assist the model in finding the generalized necessarily distinct vectors capable of retaining intricate rela-tional connections and rich local feature information; (2) By improving the pixel-wise linear independence of the feature map, the highly condensed semantic representation will be captured by the model; (3) Our novel triple-stream merging module can significantly improve the generalization capability and efficiency of the model. Experiments show that our GSNet yields a classifi-cation accuracy of 90.1%, surpassing the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer V2 by 1.9% on the steel grain size dataset, which comprises 3,599 images with 14 grain size levels. Furthermore, we intuitively believe our approach is applicable to broader ap-plications like object detection and semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Qin, Wei Ji, Xinze Lan, Hao Fei, Xun Yang, Dan Guo, Roger Zimmermann, Lizi Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Luo, Weina Fu, Shuai Liu, Saeed Anwar, Muhammad Saqib, Sambit Bakshi, Khan Muhammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Action detection and understanding provide the foundation for the generation and interaction of multimedia content. However, existing methods mainly focus on constructing complex relational inference networks, overlooking the judgment of detection effectiveness. Moreover, these methods frequently generate detection results with cognitive abnormalities. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a cognitive effectiveness network based on fuzzy inference (Cefdet), which introduces the concept of "cognition-based detection" to simulate human cognition. First, a fuzzy-driven cognitive effectiveness evaluation module (FCM) is established to introduce fuzzy inference into action detection. FCM is combined with human action features to simulate the cognition-based detection process, which clearly locates the position of frames with cognitive abnormalities. Then, a fuzzy cognitive update strategy (FCS) is proposed based on the FCM, which utilizes fuzzy logic to re-detect the cognition-based detection results and effectively update the results with cognitive abnormalities. Experimental results demonstrate that Cefdet exhibits superior performance against several mainstream algorithms on the public datasets, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoji Tian, Chongcheng Chen, Hongyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction of trees is crucial for forest resource assessments and management. Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) is commonly used for reconstructing forest scenes but faces challenges like low efficiency and poor quality. Recently, Novel View Synthesis (NVS) technologies, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have shown promise for 3D plant reconstruction with limited images. However, existing research mainly focuses on small plants in orchards or individual trees, leaving uncertainty regarding their application in larger, complex forest stands. In this study, we collected sequential images of forest plots with varying complexity and performed dense reconstruction using NeRF and 3DGS. The resulting point clouds were compared with those from photogrammetry and laser scanning. Results indicate that NVS methods significantly enhance reconstruction efficiency. Photogrammetry struggles with complex stands, leading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly reconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy regions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method generates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter at breast height (DBH) accuracy. All three methods can extract tree height information, with NeRF yielding the highest accuracy; however, photogrammetry remains superior for DBH accuracy. These findings suggest that NVS methods have significant potential for 3D reconstruction of forest stands, offering valuable support for complex forest resource inventory and visualization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linping Zhang, Yu Liu, Xueqian Wang, Gang Li, You He</p>
<p>Abstract: With the improvement in the quantity and quality of remote sensing images, content-based remote sensing object retrieval (CBRSOR) has become an increasingly important topic. However, existing CBRSOR methods neglect the utilization of global statistical information during both training and test stages, which leads to the overfitting of neural networks to simple sample pairs of samples during training and suboptimal metric performance. Inspired by the Neyman-Pearson theorem, we propose a generalized likelihood ratio test-based metric learning (GLRTML) approach, which can estimate the relative difficulty of sample pairs by incorporating global data distribution information during training and test phases. This guides the network to focus more on difficult samples during the training process, thereby encourages the network to learn more discriminative feature embeddings. In addition, GLRT is a more effective than traditional metric space due to the utilization of global data distribution information. Accurately estimating the distribution of embeddings is critical for GLRTML. However, in real-world applications, there is often a distribution shift between the training and target domains, which diminishes the effectiveness of directly using the distribution estimated on training data. To address this issue, we propose the clustering pseudo-labels-based fast parameter adaptation (CPLFPA) method. CPLFPA efficiently estimates the distribution of embeddings in the target domain by clustering target domain instances and re-estimating the distribution parameters for GLRTML. We reorganize datasets for CBRSOR tasks based on fine-grained ship remote sensing image slices (FGSRSI-23) and military aircraft recognition (MAR20) datasets. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GLRTML and CPLFPA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Salehi, Jae Sung Park, Tanush Yadav, Aditya Kusupati, Ranjay Krishna, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Our world is full of varied actions and moves across specialized domains that we, as humans, strive to identify and understand. Within any single domain, actions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep models to distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal foundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas v1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short videos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a question and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals, asking which choice "best" describes their action within a certain temporal context. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions across 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most existing video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic actions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on intricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern subtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We evaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that the best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile, Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice, achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings with state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is important for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that some leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their default configuration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Tang, Yao Zhao, Meiqin Liu, Chao Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) is renowned for generating perceptually realistic videos, yet it grapples with maintaining detail consistency across frames due to stochastic fluctuations. The traditional approach of pixel-level alignment is ineffective for diffusion-processed frames because of iterative disruptions. To overcome this, we introduce SeeClear--a novel VSR framework leveraging conditional video generation, orchestrated by instance-centric and channel-wise semantic controls. This framework integrates a Semantic Distiller and a Pixel Condenser, which synergize to extract and upscale semantic details from low-resolution frames. The Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) utilizes video-clip-wise tokens to dynamically relate pixels within and across frames, enhancing coherency. Additionally, the Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory (CaTeGory) infuses extrinsic knowledge, capitalizing on long-standing semantic textures. Our method also innovates the blurring diffusion process with the ResShift mechanism, finely balancing between sharpness and diffusion effects. Comprehensive experiments confirm our framework's advantage over state-of-the-art diffusion-based VSR techniques. The code is available: https://github.com/Tang1705/SeeClear-NeurIPS24.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subarnaduti Paul, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Martin Mundt</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep networks are frequently tuned to novel tasks and continue learning from ongoing data streams. Such sequential training requires consolidation of new and past information, a challenge predominantly addressed by retaining the most important data points - formally known as coresets. Traditionally, these coresets consist of entire samples, such as images or sentences. However, recent transformer architectures operate on tokens, leading to the famous assertion that an image is worth 16x16 words. Intuitively, not all of these tokens are equally informative or memorable. Going beyond coresets, we thus propose to construct a deeper-level data summary on the level of tokens. Our respectively named core tokensets both select the most informative data points and leverage feature attribution to store only their most relevant features. We demonstrate that core tokensets yield significant performance retention in incremental image classification, open-ended visual question answering, and continual image captioning with significantly reduced memory. In fact, we empirically find that a core tokenset of 1\% of the data performs comparably to at least a twice as large and up to 10 times larger coreset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) is challenged by background shift, where background categories in sequential data may include previously learned or future classes. Inspired by the vision-language foundation models such as CLIP, these models capture shared attributes from extensive image-text paired data during pre-training. We propose a novel method utilizing attributes in vision-language foundation models for incremental object detection. Our method constructs a Class-Agnostic Shared Attribute base (CASA) to capture common semantic information among incremental classes. Specifically, we utilize large language models to generate candidate textual attributes and select the most relevant ones based on current training data, recording their significance in an attribute assignment matrix. For subsequent tasks, we freeze the retained attributes and continue selecting from the remaining candidates while updating the attribute assignment matrix accordingly. Furthermore, we employ OWL-ViT as our baseline, preserving the original parameters of the pre-trained foundation model. Our method adds only 0.7% to parameter storage through parameter-efficient fine-tuning to significantly enhance the scalability and adaptability of IOD. Extensive two-phase and multi-phase experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting plays a pivotal role in socioeconomic sectors, especially in severe convective weather warnings. Although notable progress has been achieved by approaches mining the spatiotemporal correlations with deep learning, these methods still suffer severe blurriness as the lead time increases, which hampers accurate predictions for extreme precipitation. To alleviate blurriness, researchers explore generative methods conditioned on blurry predictions. However, the pairs of blurry predictions and corresponding ground truth need to be generated in advance, making the training pipeline cumbersome and limiting the generality of generative models within blur modes that appear in training data. By rethinking the blurriness in precipitation nowcasting as a blur kernel acting on predictions, we propose an unsupervised postprocessing method to eliminate the blurriness without the requirement of training with the pairs of blurry predictions and corresponding ground truth. Specifically, we utilize blurry predictions to guide the generation process of a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to obtain high-fidelity predictions with eliminated blurriness. A zero-shot blur kernel estimation mechanism and an auto-scale denoise guidance strategy are introduced to adapt the unconditional DDPM to any blurriness modes varying from datasets and lead times in precipitation nowcasting. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 precipitation radar datasets, demonstrating the generality and superiority of our method.</p>

To this end, we propose a novel vision transformer based random walk framework for group re-ID. Specifically, we design a vision transformer based on a monocular depth estimation algorithm to construct a graph through the average depth value of pedestrian features to fully consider the impact of camera distance on group members relationships. In addition, we propose a random walk module to reconstruct the graph by calculating affinity scores between target and gallery images to remove pedestrians who do not belong to the current group. Experimental results show that our framework is superior to most methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Karantaidis, Athanasios Pantsios, Yiannis Kompatsiaris, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target recognition in static scenarios relying on predefined datasets. However, in real-world scenarios, models must incrementally learn new information without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Models' tendency to forget old knowledge when learning new tasks, known as catastrophic forgetting, remains an open challenge. In this paper, an incremental learning framework, called IncSAR, is proposed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in SAR target recognition. IncSAR comprises a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in individual branches combined through a late-fusion strategy. A denoising module, utilizing the properties of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), is introduced to alleviate the speckle noise present in SAR images. Moreover, a random projection layer is employed to enhance the linear separability of features, and a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) approach is proposed to decorrelate the extracted class prototypes. Experimental results on the MSTAR and OpenSARShip benchmark datasets demonstrate that IncSAR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, leading to an improvement from $98.05\%$ to $99.63\%$ in average accuracy and from $3.05\%$ to $0.33\%$ in performance dropping rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanhu Zeng, Fei Zhu, Haiyang Guo, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable multi-tasking ability by learning mixed datasets jointly. However, novel tasks would be encountered sequentially in dynamic world, and continually fine-tuning LMMs often leads to performance degrades. To handle the challenges of catastrophic forgetting, existing methods leverage data replay or model expansion, both of which are not specially developed for LMMs and have their inherent limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-modality guided prompt learning framework (ModalPrompt) tailored for multimodal continual learning to effectively learn new tasks while alleviating forgetting of previous knowledge. Concretely, we learn prototype prompts for each task and exploit efficient prompt selection for task identifiers and prompt fusion for knowledge transfer based on image-text supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach, e.g., ModalPrompt achieves +20% performance gain on LMMs continual learning benchmarks with $\times$ 1.42 inference speed refraining from growing training cost in proportion to the number of tasks. The code will be made publically available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can we detect an object that is not visible in an image? This study introduces the novel task of 2D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to solve this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision--language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that captures different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluations on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k dataset with COCO object categories demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task. The current work presents a promising step towards compelling applications like visual search and probabilistic planning that can leverage object detection beyond what can be directly observed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detection of anomaly events is relevant for public safety and requires a combination of fine-grained motion information and contextual events at variable time-scales. To this end, we propose a Multi-Timescale Feature Learning (MTFL) method to enhance the representation of anomaly features. Short, medium, and long temporal tubelets are employed to extract spatio-temporal video features using a Video Swin Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that MTFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving an anomaly detection performance 89.78% AUC. Moreover, it performs complementary to SotA with 95.32% AUC on the ShanghaiTech and 84.57% AP on the XD-Violence dataset. Furthermore, we generate an extended dataset of the UCF-Crime for development and evaluation on a wider range of anomalies, namely Video Anomaly Detection Dataset (VADD), involving 2,591 videos in 18 classes with extensive coverage of realistic anomalies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Ye, Ziyang Chen, Jianpeng Zhang, Yutong Xie, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal segmentation models offer significant potential in addressing a wide range of tasks by effectively leveraging discrete annotations. As the scope of tasks and modalities expands, it becomes increasingly important to generate and strategically position task- and modal-specific priors within the universal model. However, existing universal models often overlook the correlations between different priors, and the optimal placement and frequency of these priors remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MedUniSeg, a prompt-driven universal segmentation model designed for 2D and 3D multi-task segmentation across diverse modalities and domains. MedUniSeg employs multiple modal-specific prompts alongside a universal task prompt to accurately characterize the modalities and tasks. To generate the related priors, we propose the modal map (MMap) and the fusion and selection (FUSE) modules, which transform modal and task prompts into corresponding priors. These modal and task priors are systematically introduced at the start and end of the encoding process. We evaluate MedUniSeg on a comprehensive multi-modal upstream dataset consisting of 17 sub-datasets. The results demonstrate that MedUniSeg achieves superior multi-task segmentation performance, attaining a 1.2% improvement in the mean Dice score across the 17 upstream tasks compared to nnUNet baselines, while using less than 1/10 of the parameters. For tasks that underperform during the initial multi-task joint training, we freeze MedUniSeg and introduce new modules to re-learn these tasks. This approach yields an enhanced version, MedUniSeg*, which consistently outperforms MedUniSeg across all tasks. Moreover, MedUniSeg surpasses advanced self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models on six downstream tasks, establishing itself as a high-quality, highly generalizable pre-trained segmentation model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Singh, Mansi Gupta, Shivank Garg, Abhinav Kumar, Vansh Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed tasks requiring visual and reasoning abilities, such as image retrieval and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite their success, VLMs face significant challenges with tasks involving geometric reasoning, algebraic problem-solving, and counting. These limitations stem from difficulties effectively integrating multiple modalities and accurately interpreting geometry-related tasks. Various works claim that introducing a captioning pipeline before VQA tasks enhances performance. We incorporated this pipeline for tasks involving geometry, algebra, and counting. We found that captioning results are not generalizable, specifically with larger VLMs primarily trained on downstream QnA tasks showing random performance on math-related challenges. However, we present a promising alternative: task-based prompting, enriching the prompt with task-specific guidance. This approach shows promise and proves more effective than direct captioning methods for math-heavy problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takara Taniguchi, Ryosuke Furuta</p>
<p>Abstract: We tackle one-shot object detection in Japanese Manga. The rising global popularity of Japanese manga has made the object detection of character faces increasingly important, with potential applications such as automatic colorization. However, obtaining sufficient data for training conventional object detectors is challenging due to copyright restrictions. Additionally, new characters appear every time a new volume of manga is released, making it impractical to re-train object detectors each time to detect these new characters. Therefore, one-shot object detection, where only a single query (reference) image is required to detect a new character, is an essential task in the manga industry. One challenge with one-shot object detection in manga is the large variation in the poses and facial expressions of characters in target images, despite having only one query image as a reference. Another challenge is that the frequency of character appearances follows a long-tail distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a data augmentation method in feature space to increase the variation of the query. The proposed method augments the feature from the query by adding Gaussian noise, with the noise variance at each channel learned during training. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the performance for both seen and unseen classes, surpassing data augmentation methods in image space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Xing, Xiangyuan Lan, Ruiping Wang, Dongmei Jiang, Wenjun Huang, Qingfang Zheng, Yaowei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba-based architectures have shown to be a promising new direction for deep learning models owing to their competitive performance and sub-quadratic deployment speed. However, current Mamba multi-modal large language models (MLLM) are insufficient in extracting visual features, leading to imbalanced cross-modal alignment between visual and textural latents, negatively impacting performance on multi-modal tasks. In this work, we propose Empowering Multi-modal Mamba with Structural and Hierarchical Alignment (EMMA), which enables the MLLM to extract fine-grained visual information. Specifically, we propose a pixel-wise alignment module to autoregressively optimize the learning and processing of spatial image-level features along with textual tokens, enabling structural alignment at the image level. In addition, to prevent the degradation of visual information during the cross-model alignment process, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module to combine multi-scale visual features from intermediate layers, enabling hierarchical alignment at the feature level. Extensive experiments are conducted across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks. Our model shows lower latency than other Mamba-based MLLMs and is nearly four times faster than transformer-based MLLMs of similar scale during inference. Due to better cross-modal alignment, our model exhibits lower degrees of hallucination and enhanced sensitivity to visual details, which manifests in superior performance across diverse multi-modal benchmarks. Code will be provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Streli, Mark Richardson, Fadi Botros, Shugao Ma, Robert Wang, Christian Holz</p>
<p>Abstract: While passive surfaces offer numerous benefits for interaction in mixed reality, reliably detecting touch input solely from head-mounted cameras has been a long-standing challenge. Camera specifics, hand self-occlusion, and rapid movements of both head and fingers introduce considerable uncertainty about the exact location of touch events. Existing methods have thus not been capable of achieving the performance needed for robust interaction. In this paper, we present a real-time pipeline that detects touch input from all ten fingers on any physical surface, purely based on egocentric hand tracking. Our method TouchInsight comprises a neural network to predict the moment of a touch event, the finger making contact, and the touch location. TouchInsight represents locations through a bivariate Gaussian distribution to account for uncertainties due to sensing inaccuracies, which we resolve through contextual priors to accurately infer intended user input. We first evaluated our method offline and found that it locates input events with a mean error of 6.3 mm, and accurately detects touch events (F1=0.99) and identifies the finger used (F1=0.96). In an online evaluation, we then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for a core application of dexterous touch input: two-handed text entry. In our study, participants typed 37.0 words per minute with an uncorrected error rate of 2.9% on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangtao Lv, Huangsen Cao, Kainan Tu, Yihuai Xu, Zhimeng Zhang, Xin Ding, Yongwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision models have been found vulnerable to adversarial examples, emphasizing the need for enhancing their adversarial robustness. While adversarial training is an effective defense for deep convolutional models, it often faces scalability issues with large vision models due to high computational costs. Recent approaches propose robust fine-tuning methods, such as adversarial tuning of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in large vision models, but they still struggle to match the accuracy of full parameter adversarial fine-tuning. The integration of various defense mechanisms offers a promising approach to enhancing the robustness of large vision models, yet this paradigm remains underexplored. To address this, we propose hyper adversarial tuning (HyperAT), which leverages shared defensive knowledge among different methods to improve model robustness efficiently and effectively simultaneously. Specifically, adversarial tuning of each defense method is formulated as a learning task, and a hypernetwork generates LoRA specific to this defense. Then, a random sampling and tuning strategy is proposed to extract and facilitate the defensive knowledge transfer between different defenses. Finally, diverse LoRAs are merged to enhance the adversarial robustness. Experiments on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that HyperAT significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of pretrained large vision models without excessive computational overhead, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Jin, Zhicheng Sun, Ningyuan Li, Kun Xu, Kun Xu, Hao Jiang, Nan Zhuang, Quzhe Huang, Yang Song, Yadong Mu, Zhouchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation requires modeling a vast spatiotemporal space, which demands significant computational resources and data usage. To reduce the complexity, the prevailing approaches employ a cascaded architecture to avoid direct training with full resolution. Despite reducing computational demands, the separate optimization of each sub-stage hinders knowledge sharing and sacrifices flexibility. This work introduces a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm. It reinterprets the original denoising trajectory as a series of pyramid stages, where only the final stage operates at the full resolution, thereby enabling more efficient video generative modeling. Through our sophisticated design, the flows of different pyramid stages can be interlinked to maintain continuity. Moreover, we craft autoregressive video generation with a temporal pyramid to compress the full-resolution history. The entire framework can be optimized in an end-to-end manner and with a single unified Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method supports generating high-quality 5-second (up to 10-second) videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05963">Training-Free Open-Ended Object Detection and Segmentation via Attention as Prompts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Lin, Yongtao Wang, Zhi Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing perception models achieve great success by learning from large amounts of labeled data, but they still struggle with open-world scenarios. To alleviate this issue, researchers introduce open-set perception tasks to detect or segment unseen objects in the training set. However, these models require predefined object categories as inputs during inference, which are not available in real-world scenarios. Recently, researchers pose a new and more practical problem, \textit{i.e.}, open-ended object detection, which discovers unseen objects without any object categories as inputs. In this paper, we present VL-SAM, a training-free framework that combines the generalized object recognition model (\textit{i.e.,} Vision-Language Model) with the generalized object localization model (\textit{i.e.,} Segment-Anything Model), to address the open-ended object detection and segmentation task. Without additional training, we connect these two generalized models with attention maps as the prompts. Specifically, we design an attention map generation module by employing head aggregation and a regularized attention flow to aggregate and propagate attention maps across all heads and layers in VLM, yielding high-quality attention maps. Then, we iteratively sample positive and negative points from the attention maps with a prompt generation module and send the sampled points to SAM to segment corresponding objects. Experimental results on the long-tail instance segmentation dataset (LVIS) show that our method surpasses the previous open-ended method on the object detection task and can provide additional instance segmentation masks. Besides, VL-SAM achieves favorable performance on the corner case object detection dataset (CODA), demonstrating the effectiveness of VL-SAM in real-world applications. Moreover, VL-SAM exhibits good model generalization that can incorporate various VLMs and SAMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking aims to determine the location of human targets in a scene using signals captured by a multi-sensor platform, whose accuracy and robustness can be improved by multi-modal fusion methods. Recently, several fusion methods have been proposed to model the correlation in multiple modalities. However, for the speaker tracking problem, the cross-modal interaction between audio and visual signals hasn't been well exploited. To this end, we present a novel Speaker Tracking Network (STNet) with a deep audio-visual fusion model in this work. We design a visual-guided acoustic measurement method to fuse heterogeneous cues in a unified localization space, which employs visual observations via a camera model to construct the enhanced acoustic map. For feature fusion, a cross-modal attention module is adopted to jointly model multi-modal contexts and interactions. The correlated information between audio and visual features is further interacted in the fusion model. Moreover, the STNet-based tracker is applied to multi-speaker cases by a quality-aware module, which evaluates the reliability of multi-modal observations to achieve robust tracking in complex scenarios. Experiments on the AV16.3 and CAV3D datasets show that the proposed STNet-based tracker outperforms uni-modal methods and state-of-the-art audio-visual speaker trackers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Document understanding is a challenging task to process and comprehend large amounts of textual and visual information. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of this task. However, existing methods typically focus on either plain text or a limited number of document images, struggling to handle long PDF documents with interleaved text and images, especially in academic papers. In this paper, we introduce PDF-WuKong, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) which is designed to enhance multimodal question-answering (QA) for long PDF documents. PDF-WuKong incorporates a sparse sampler that operates on both text and image representations, significantly improving the efficiency and capability of the MLLM. The sparse sampler is integrated with the MLLM's image encoder and selects the paragraphs or diagrams most pertinent to user queries for processing by the language model. To effectively train and evaluate our model, we construct PaperPDF, a dataset consisting of a broad collection of academic papers sourced from arXiv, multiple strategies are proposed to generate automatically 1M QA pairs along with their corresponding evidence sources. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and high efficiency of our approach over other models on the task of long multimodal PDF understanding, surpassing proprietary products by an average of 8.6% on F1.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bozhou Zhang, Nan Song, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting for traffic agents is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. Mainstream methods adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-modal trajectories. While straightforward and effective, the absence of detailed representation of future trajectories may yield suboptimal outcomes, given that the agent states dynamically evolve over time. To address this problem, we introduce DeMo, a framework that decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries capturing distinct directional intentions and state queries tracking the agent's dynamic states over time. By leveraging this format, we separately optimize the multi-modality and dynamic evolutionary properties of trajectories. Subsequently, the mode and state queries are integrated to obtain a comprehensive and detailed representation of the trajectories. To achieve these operations, we additionally introduce combined Attention and Mamba techniques for global information aggregation and state sequence modeling, leveraging their respective strengths. Extensive experiments on both the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that our DeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charalambos Tzamos, Viktor Kocur, Yaqing Ding, Torsten Sattler, Zuzana Kukelova</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the relative pose between two cameras is a fundamental step in many applications such as Structure-from-Motion. The common approach to relative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop. Highly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras exhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to (significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are significantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and implementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with a simple-to-implement approach that combines an efficient pinhole solver with sampled radial distortion parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and RANSAC variants show that this simple approach performs similarly or better than the most accurate minimal distortion solvers at faster run-times while being significantly more accurate than faster non-minimal solvers. We clearly show that complex radial distortion solvers are not necessary in practice. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/kocurvik/rd.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a popular format on the web and in the design industry. However, despite the great strides made in generative modeling, SVG has remained underexplored due to the discrete and complex nature of such data. We introduce GRIMOIRE, a text-guided SVG generative model that is comprised of two modules: A Visual Shape Quantizer (VSQ) learns to map raster images onto a discrete codebook by reconstructing them as vector shapes, and an Auto-Regressive Transformer (ART) models the joint probability distribution over shape tokens, positions and textual descriptions, allowing us to generate vector graphics from natural language. Unlike existing models that require direct supervision from SVG data, GRIMOIRE learns shape image patches using only raster image supervision which opens up vector generative modeling to significantly more data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fitting GRIMOIRE for closed filled shapes on the MNIST and for outline strokes on icon and font data, surpassing previous image-supervised methods in generative quality and vector-supervised approach in flexibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information comes in diverse modalities. Multimodal native AI models are essential to integrate real-world information and deliver comprehensive understanding. While proprietary multimodal native models exist, their lack of openness imposes obstacles for adoptions, let alone adaptations. To fill this gap, we introduce Aria, an open multimodal native model with best-in-class performance across a wide range of multimodal, language, and coding tasks. Aria is a mixture-of-expert model with 3.9B and 3.5B activated parameters per visual token and text token, respectively. It outperforms Pixtral-12B and Llama3.2-11B, and is competitive against the best proprietary models on various multimodal tasks. We pre-train Aria from scratch following a 4-stage pipeline, which progressively equips the model with strong capabilities in language understanding, multimodal understanding, long context window, and instruction following. We open-source the model weights along with a codebase that facilitates easy adoptions and adaptations of Aria in real-world applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06007">Motion Forecasting in Continuous Driving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Song, Bozhou Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion forecasting for agents in autonomous driving is highly challenging due to the numerous possibilities for each agent's next action and their complex interactions in space and time. In real applications, motion forecasting takes place repeatedly and continuously as the self-driving car moves. However, existing forecasting methods typically process each driving scene within a certain range independently, totally ignoring the situational and contextual relationships between successive driving scenes. This significantly simplifies the forecasting task, making the solutions suboptimal and inefficient to use in practice. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a novel motion forecasting framework for continuous driving, named RealMotion. It comprises two integral streams both at the scene level: (1) The scene context stream progressively accumulates historical scene information until the present moment, capturing temporal interactive relationships among scene elements. (2) The agent trajectory stream optimizes current forecasting by sequentially relaying past predictions. Besides, a data reorganization strategy is introduced to narrow the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world applications, consistent with our network. These approaches enable exploiting more broadly the situational and progressive insights of dynamic motion across space and time. Extensive experiments on Argoverse series with different settings demonstrate that our RealMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, along with the advantage of efficient real-world inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Kirchhof, James Thornton, Pierre Ablin, Louis B\'ethune, Eugene Ndiaye, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased adoption of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has triggered concerns on their reliability. Such models are now closely scrutinized under the lens of various metrics, notably calibration, fairness, or compute efficiency. We focus in this work on two issues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when prompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To solve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories of pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a reference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE throughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is expected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our method is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive most of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation trajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either with a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by updating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently generated within a batch. We show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity while impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better than other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how SPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected images by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haadia Amjad, Kilian Goeller, Steffen Seitz, Carsten Knoll, Naseer Bajwa, Muhammad Imran Malik, Ronald Tetzlaff</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning is actively being used in biometrics to develop efficient identification and verification systems. Handwritten signatures are a common subset of biometric data for authentication purposes. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn from original and forged signatures to generate forged signatures. While most GAN techniques create a strong signature verifier, which is the discriminator, there is a need to focus more on the quality of forgeries generated by the generator model. This work focuses on creating a generator that produces forged samples that achieve a benchmark in spoofing signature verification systems. We use CycleGANs infused with Inception model-like blocks with attention heads as the generator and a variation of the SigCNN model as the base Discriminator. We train our model with a new technique that results in 80% to 100% success in signature spoofing. Additionally, we create a custom evaluation technique to act as a goodness measure of the generated forgeries. Our work advocates generator-focused GAN architectures for spoofing data quality that aid in a better understanding of biometric data generation and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huangsen Cao, Yongwei Wang, Yinfeng Liu, Sixian Zheng, Kangtao Lv, Zhimeng Zhang, Bo Zhang, Xin Ding, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of diverse generative vision models has recently enabled the synthesis of visually realistic images, underscoring the critical need for effectively detecting these generated images from real photos. Despite advances in this field, existing detection approaches often struggle to accurately identify synthesized images generated by different generative models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable detection framework termed HyperDet, which innovatively captures and integrates shared knowledge from a collection of functionally distinct and lightweight expert detectors. HyperDet leverages a large pretrained vision model to extract general detection features while simultaneously capturing and enhancing task-specific features. To achieve this, HyperDet first groups SRM filters into five distinct groups to efficiently capture varying levels of pixel artifacts based on their different functionality and complexity. Then, HyperDet utilizes a hypernetwork to generate LoRA model weights with distinct embedding parameters. Finally, we merge the LoRA networks to form an efficient model ensemble. Also, we propose a novel objective function that balances the pixel and semantic artifacts effectively. Extensive experiments on the UnivFD and Fake2M datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our work paves a new way to establish generalizable domain-specific fake image detectors based on pretrained large vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyuan Cao, Jiaxin Ye, Yujie Wei, Hongming Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as Stable Diffusion, often experience significant structural distortions when directly generating high-resolution (HR) images that exceed their original training resolutions. A straightforward and cost-effective solution is to adapt pre-trained LDMs for HR image generation; however, existing methods often suffer from poor image quality and long inference time. In this paper, we propose an Attentive and Progressive LDM (AP-LDM), a novel, training-free framework aimed at enhancing HR image quality while accelerating the generation process. AP-LDM decomposes the denoising process of LDMs into two stages: (i) attentive training-resolution denoising, and (ii) progressive high-resolution denoising. The first stage generates a latent representation of a higher-quality training-resolution image through the proposed attentive guidance, which utilizes a novel parameter-free self-attention mechanism to enhance the structural consistency. The second stage progressively performs upsampling in pixel space, alleviating the severe artifacts caused by latent space upsampling. Leveraging the effective initialization from the first stage enables denoising at higher resolutions with significantly fewer steps, enhancing overall efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AP-LDM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering up to a 5x speedup in HR image generation, thereby highlighting its substantial advantages for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Mulrooney, Austin J. Brockmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the neural response to natural images in the visual cortex requires extracting relevant features from the images and relating those feature to the observed responses. In this work, we optimize the feature extraction in order to maximize the information shared between the image features and the neural response across voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) extracted from the BOLD signal measured by fMRI. We adapt contrastive learning (CL) to fine-tune a convolutional neural network, which was pretrained for image classification, such that a mapping of a given image's features are more similar to the corresponding fMRI response than to the responses to other images. We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al., 2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which contains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of thousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature extraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as compared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a regression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response encoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models, including subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023). We also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding performance. Finally, we examine the performance of the fine-tuned models on common image classification tasks, explore the landscape of ROI-specific models by applying dimensionality reduction on the Bhattacharya dissimilarity matrix created using the predictions on those tasks (Mao et al., 2024), and investigate lateralization of the processing for early visual ROIs using salience maps of the classifiers built on the CL-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Xia, Xueqi Hu, Li Sun, Qingli Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In StyleGAN, convolution kernels are shaped by both static parameters shared across images and dynamic modulation factors $w^+\in\mathcal{W}^+$ specific to each image. Therefore, $\mathcal{W}^+$ space is often used for image inversion and editing. However, pre-trained model struggles with synthesizing out-of-domain images due to the limited capabilities of $\mathcal{W}^+$ and its resultant kernels, necessitating full fine-tuning or adaptation through a complex hypernetwork. This paper proposes an efficient refining strategy for dynamic kernels. The key idea is to modify kernels by low-rank residuals, learned from input image or domain guidance. These residuals are generated by matrix multiplication between two sets of tokens with the same number, which controls the complexity. We validate the refining scheme in image inversion and domain adaptation. In the former task, we design grouped transformer blocks to learn these token sets by one- or two-stage training. In the latter task, token sets are directly optimized to support synthesis in the target domain while preserving original content. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves low distortions for image inversion and high quality for out-of-domain editing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The data-hungry approach of supervised classification drives the interest of the researchers toward unsupervised approaches, especially for problems such as medical image segmentation, where labeled data are difficult to get. Motivated by the recent success of Vision transformers (ViT) in various computer vision tasks, we propose an unsupervised segmentation framework with a pre-trained ViT. Moreover, by harnessing the graph structure inherent within the image, the proposed method achieves a notable performance in segmentation, especially in medical images. We further introduce a modularity-based loss function coupled with an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) filter to capture the inherent graph topology within the image. Finally, we observe that employing Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) and SILU (Swish) activation functions within the proposed Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture enhances the performance of segmentation. The proposed method provides state-of-the-art performance (even comparable to supervised methods) on benchmark image segmentation datasets such as ECSSD, DUTS, and CUB, as well as challenging medical image segmentation datasets such as KVASIR, CVC-ClinicDB, ISIC-2018.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Jin, Liaoruxing Zhang, Chenyu Fan, Wenbo Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the development of photography art, many so-called "templates" have been formed, namely visual styles summarized from a series of themed and stylized photography works. In this paper, we propose to analysize and and summarize these 'templates' in photography by learning composite templates of photography images. We present a framework for learning a hierarchical reconfigurable image template from photography images to learn and characterize the "templates" used in these photography images. Using this method, we measured the artistic quality of photography on the photos and conducted photography guidance. In addition, we also utilized the "templates" for guidance in several image generation tasks. Experimental results show that the learned templates can well describe the photography techniques and styles, whereas the proposed approach can assess the quality of photography images as human being does.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yize Chen, Zhiyuan Yan, Siwei Lyu, Baoyuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become an important task. Most existing detection methods provide only real/fake predictions without offering human-comprehensible explanations. Recent studies leveraging MLLMs for deepfake detection have shown improvements in explainability. However, the performance of pre-trained MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA) remains limited due to a lack of understanding of their capabilities for this task and strategies to enhance them. In this work, we empirically assess the strengths and weaknesses of MLLMs specifically in deepfake detection via forgery features analysis. Building on these assessments, we propose a novel framework called ${X}^2$-DFD, consisting of three core modules. The first module, Model Feature Assessment (MFA), measures the detection capabilities of forgery features intrinsic to MLLMs, and gives a descending ranking of these features. The second module, Strong Feature Strengthening (SFS), enhances the detection and explanation capabilities by fine-tuning the MLLM on a dataset constructed based on the top-ranked features. The third module, Weak Feature Supplementing (WFS), improves the fine-tuned MLLM's capabilities on lower-ranked features by integrating external dedicated deepfake detectors. To verify the effectiveness of this framework, we further present a practical implementation, where an automated forgery features generation, evaluation, and ranking procedure is designed for MFA module; an automated generation procedure of the fine-tuning dataset containing real and fake images with explanations based on top-ranked features is developed for SFS model; an external conventional deepfake detector focusing on blending artifact, which corresponds to a low detection capability in the pre-trained MLLM, is integrated for WFS module. Experiments show that our approach enhances both detection and explanation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangfan Deng, Zhuang Jia, Zhaoxue Wang, Xiang Long, Daniel K. Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding the eye and parsing out the parts (e.g. pupil and iris) is a key prerequisite for image-based eye tracking, which has become an indispensable module in today's head-mounted VR/AR devices. However, a typical route for training a segmenter requires tedious handlabeling. In this work, we explore an unsupervised way. First, we utilize priors of human eye and extract signals from the image to establish rough clues indicating the eye-region structure. Upon these sparse and noisy clues, a segmentation network is trained to gradually identify the precise area for each part. To achieve accurate parsing of the eye-region, we first leverage the pretrained foundation model Segment Anything (SAM) in an automatic way to refine the eye indications. Then, the learning process is designed in an end-to-end manner following progressive and prior-aware principle. Experiments show that our unsupervised approach can easily achieve 90% (the pupil and iris) and 85% (the whole eye-region) of the performances under supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingle Xu, Jaehwan Lee, Sook Yoon, Dong Sun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which aims to distinguish unknown classes from known classes, has received increasing attention recently. A main challenge within is the unavailable of samples from the unknown classes in the training process, and an effective strategy is to improve the performance for known classes. Using beneficial strategies such as data augmentation and longer training is thus a way to improve OOD detection. However, label smoothing, an effective method for classifying known classes, degrades the performance of OOD detection, and this phenomenon is under exploration. In this paper, we first analyze that the limited and predefined learning target in label smoothing results in the smaller maximal probability and logit, which further leads to worse OOD detection performance. To mitigate this issue, we then propose a novel regularization method, called adaptive label smoothing (ALS), and the core is to push the non-true classes to have same probabilities whereas the maximal probability is neither fixed nor limited. Extensive experimental results in six datasets with two backbones suggest that ALS contributes to classifying known samples and discerning unknown samples with clear margins. Our code will be available to the public.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06149">Toward Scalable Image Feature Compression: A Content-Adaptive and Diffusion-Based Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sha Guo, Zhuo Chen, Yang Zhao, Ning Zhang, Xiaotong Li, Lingyu Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional image codecs emphasize signal fidelity and human perception, often at the expense of machine vision tasks. Deep learning methods have demonstrated promising coding performance by utilizing rich semantic embeddings optimized for both human and machine vision. However, these compact embeddings struggle to capture fine details such as contours and textures, resulting in imperfect reconstructions. Furthermore, existing learning-based codecs lack scalability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a content-adaptive diffusion model for scalable image compression. The proposed method encodes fine textures through a diffusion process, enhancing perceptual quality while preserving essential features for machine vision tasks. The approach employs a Markov palette diffusion model combined with widely used feature extractors and image generators, enabling efficient data compression. By leveraging collaborative texture-semantic feature extraction and pseudo-label generation, the method accurately captures texture information. A content-adaptive Markov palette diffusion model is then applied to represent both low-level textures and high-level semantic content in a scalable manner. This framework offers flexible control over compression ratios by selecting intermediate diffusion states, eliminating the need for retraining deep learning models at different operating points. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both image reconstruction and downstream machine vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and facial landmark detection, achieving superior perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method (GLOV) enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as implicit Optimizers for Vision-Langugage Models (VLMs) to enhance downstream vision tasks. Our GLOV meta-prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to a purity measure obtained through a fitness function. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of text prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we also explicitly steer the LLM generation process in each optimization step by specifically adding an offset difference vector of the embeddings from the positive and negative solutions found by the LLM, in previous optimization steps, to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation step. This offset vector steers the LLM generation toward the type of language preferred by the downstream VLM, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on 16 diverse datasets using two families of VLMs, i.e., dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LLaVa) models -- showing that the discovered solutions can enhance the recognition performance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% (3.8% and 21.6% on average) for these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Li, Yuanxin Liu, Linli Yao, Peiyuan Zhang, Chenxin An, Lean Wang, Xu Sun, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in video comprehension, yet they struggle with tracking temporal changes and reasoning about temporal relationships. While previous research attributed this limitation to the ineffective temporal encoding of visual inputs, our diagnostic study reveals that video representations contain sufficient information for even small probing classifiers to achieve perfect accuracy. Surprisingly, we find that the key bottleneck in Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capability stems from the underlying LLM's inherent difficulty with temporal concepts, as evidenced by poor performance on textual temporal question-answering tasks. Building on this discovery, we introduce the Textual Temporal reasoning Transfer (T3). T3 synthesizes diverse temporal reasoning tasks in pure text format from existing image-text datasets, addressing the scarcity of video samples with complex temporal scenarios. Remarkably, without using any video data, T3 enhances LongVA-7B's temporal understanding, yielding a 5.3 absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging TempCompass benchmark, which enables our model to outperform ShareGPT4Video-8B trained on 28,000 video samples. Additionally, the enhanced LongVA-7B model achieves competitive performance on comprehensive video benchmarks. For example, it achieves a 49.7 accuracy on the Temporal Reasoning task of Video-MME, surpassing powerful large-scale models such as InternVL-Chat-V1.5-20B and VILA1.5-40B. Further analysis reveals a strong correlation between textual and video temporal task performance, validating the efficacy of transferring temporal reasoning abilities from text to video domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phu Pham, Wentian Zhao, Kun Wan, Yu-Jhe Li, Zeliang Zhang, Daniel Miranda, Ajinkya Kale, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past year, the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved across various aspects. However, constrained by the quadratic growth of computation in LLMs as the number of tokens increases, efficiency has become a bottleneck for further scaling MLLMs. Although recent efforts have been made to prune visual tokens or use more lightweight LLMs to reduce computation, the problem of quadratic growth in computation with the increase of visual tokens still persists. To address this, we propose a novel approach: instead of reducing the input visual tokens for LLMs, we focus on pruning vision-related computations within the LLMs. After pruning, the computation growth in the LLM is no longer quadratic with the increase of visual tokens, but linear. Surprisingly, we found that after applying such extensive pruning, the capabilities of MLLMs are comparable with the original one and even superior on some benchmarks with only 25% of the computation. This finding opens up the possibility for MLLMs to incorporate much denser visual tokens. Additionally, based on this finding, we further analyzed some architectural design deficiencies in existing MLLMs and proposed promising improvements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the computational redundancy in the LLM's vision component of MLLMs. Code and checkpoints will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Miao, Delong Chen, Fan Liu, Chuanyi Zhang, Yanhui Gu, Shengjie Guo, Jun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Direct Segment Anything Model (DirectSAM) excels in class-agnostic contour extraction. In this paper, we explore its use by applying it to optical remote sensing imagery, where semantic contour extraction-such as identifying buildings, road networks, and coastlines-holds significant practical value. Those applications are currently handled via training specialized small models separately on small datasets in each domain. We introduce a foundation model derived from DirectSAM, termed DirectSAM-RS, which not only inherits the strong segmentation capability acquired from natural images, but also benefits from a large-scale dataset we created for remote sensing semantic contour extraction. This dataset comprises over 34k image-text-contour triplets, making it at least 30 times larger than individual dataset. DirectSAM-RS integrates a prompter module: a text encoder and cross-attention layers attached to the DirectSAM architecture, which allows flexible conditioning on target class labels or referring expressions. We evaluate the DirectSAM-RS in both zero-shot and fine-tuning setting, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across several downstream benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyuan Zhang, Zhengfei Kuang, Haian Jin, Zexiang Xu, Sai Bi, Hao Tan, He Zhang, Yiwei Hu, Milos Hasan, William T. Freeman, Kai Zhang, Fujun Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Andrew Irvin, Emily Ruoyu Liu, Joyce Chuyi Chen, Ines Dormoy, Jinyoung Kim, Samar Khanna, Zhuo Zheng, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision and language assistants have enabled new capabilities for interpreting natural images. These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than specialist models trained to perform these specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single EO image instruction-following model. We publicly release our data, models, and code at https://github.com/ermongroup/TEOChat .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Binninger, Olga Sorkine-Hornung</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-resolution quantized imagery, such as pixel art, is seeing a revival in modern applications ranging from video game graphics to digital design and fabrication, where creativity is often bound by a limited palette of elemental units. Despite their growing popularity, the automated generation of quantized images from raw inputs remains a significant challenge, often necessitating intensive manual input. We introduce SD-$\pi$XL, an approach for producing quantized images that employs score distillation sampling in conjunction with a differentiable image generator. Our method enables users to input a prompt and optionally an image for spatial conditioning, set any desired output size $H \times W$, and choose a palette of $n$ colors or elements. Each color corresponds to a distinct class for our generator, which operates on an $H \times W \times n$ tensor. We adopt a softmax approach, computing a convex sum of elements, thus rendering the process differentiable and amenable to backpropagation. We show that employing Gumbel-softmax reparameterization allows for crisp pixel art effects. Unique to our method is the ability to transform input images into low-resolution, quantized versions while retaining their key semantic features. Our experiments validate SD-$\pi$XL's performance in creating visually pleasing and faithful representations, consistently outperforming the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we showcase SD-$\pi$XL's practical utility in fabrication through its applications in interlocking brick mosaic, beading and embroidery design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazi Bu, Pengyang Ling, Pan Zhang, Tong Wu, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The text-to-video (T2V) generation models, offering convenient visual creation, have recently garnered increasing attention. Despite their substantial potential, the generated videos may present artifacts, including structural implausibility, temporal inconsistency, and a lack of motion, often resulting in near-static video. In this work, we have identified a correlation between the disparity of temporal attention maps across different blocks and the occurrence of temporal inconsistencies. Additionally, we have observed that the energy contained within the temporal attention maps is directly related to the magnitude of motion amplitude in the generated videos. Based on these observations, we present BroadWay, a training-free method to improve the quality of text-to-video generation without introducing additional parameters, augmenting memory or sampling time. Specifically, BroadWay is composed of two principal components: 1) Temporal Self-Guidance improves the structural plausibility and temporal consistency of generated videos by reducing the disparity between the temporal attention maps across various decoder blocks. 2) Fourier-based Motion Enhancement enhances the magnitude and richness of motion by amplifying the energy of the map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BroadWay significantly improves the quality of text-to-video generation with negligible additional cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinong Oliver Wang, Eileen Li, Jinqi Luo, Zhaoning Wang, Fernando De la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring model explainability and robustness is essential for reliable deployment of deep vision systems. Current methods for evaluating robustness rely on collecting and annotating extensive test sets. While this is common practice, the process is labor-intensive and expensive with no guarantee of sufficient coverage across attributes of interest. Recently, model diagnosis frameworks have emerged leveraging user inputs (e.g., text) to assess the vulnerability of the model. However, such dependence on human can introduce bias and limitation given the domain knowledge of particular users. This paper proposes Unsupervised Model Diagnosis (UMO), that leverages generative models to produce semantic counterfactual explanations without any user guidance. Given a differentiable computer vision model (i.e., the target model), UMO optimizes for the most counterfactual directions in a generative latent space. Our approach identifies and visualizes changes in semantics, and then matches these changes to attributes from wide-ranging text sources, such as dictionaries or language models. We validate the framework on multiple vision tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, keypoint detection). Extensive experiments show that our unsupervised discovery of semantic directions can correctly highlight spurious correlations and visualize the failure mode of target models without any human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Mao, Xiaoke Huang, Yunfei Xie, Yuanqi Chang, Mude Hui, Bingjie Xu, Yuyin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Story visualization, the task of generating coherent images based on a narrative, has seen significant advancements with the emergence of text-to-image models, particularly diffusion models. However, maintaining semantic consistency, generating high-quality fine-grained interactions, and ensuring computational feasibility remain challenging, especially in long story visualization (i.e., up to 100 frames). In this work, we propose a training-free and computationally efficient framework, termed Story-Adapter, to enhance the generative capability of long stories. Specifically, we propose an iterative paradigm to refine each generated image, leveraging both the text prompt and all generated images from the previous iteration. Central to our framework is a training-free global reference cross-attention module, which aggregates all generated images from the previous iteration to preserve semantic consistency across the entire story, while minimizing computational costs with global embeddings. This iterative process progressively optimizes image generation by repeatedly incorporating text constraints, resulting in more precise and fine-grained interactions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of Story-Adapter in improving both semantic consistency and generative capability for fine-grained interactions, particularly in long story scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengji Tang, Weicai Ye, Peng Ye, Weihao Lin, Yang Zhou, Tao Chen, Wanli Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness. Project website: https://open3dvlab.github.io/HiSplat/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gongxin Yao, Xinyang Li, Luowei Fu, Yu Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving monocular camera localization within pre-built LiDAR maps can bypass the simultaneous mapping process of visual SLAM systems, potentially reducing the computational overhead of autonomous localization. To this end, one of the key challenges is cross-modal place recognition, which involves retrieving 3D scenes (point clouds) from a LiDAR map according to online RGB images. In this paper, we introduce an efficient framework to learn descriptors for both RGB images and point clouds. It takes visual state space model (VMamba) as the backbone and employs a pixel-view-scene joint training strategy for cross-modal contrastive learning. To address the field-of-view differences, independent descriptors are generated from multiple evenly distributed viewpoints for point clouds. A visible 3D points overlap strategy is then designed to quantify the similarity between point cloud views and RGB images for multi-view supervision. Additionally, when generating descriptors from pixel-level features using NetVLAD, we compensate for the loss of geometric information, and introduce an efficient scheme for multi-view generation. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simona Reale, Pietro Di Stasio, Francesco Mauro, Alessandro Sebastianelli, Paolo Gamba, Silvia Liberata Ullo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel method for data splitting is presented: an iterative procedure divides the input dataset of volcanic eruption, chosen as the proposed use case, into two parts using a dissimilarity index calculated on the cumulative histograms of these two parts. The Cumulative Histogram Dissimilarity (CHD) index is introduced as part of the design. Based on the obtained results the proposed model in this case, compared to both Random splitting and K-means implemented over different configurations, achieves the best performance, with a slightly higher number of epochs. However, this demonstrates that the model can learn more deeply from the input dataset, which is attributable to the quality of the splitting. In fact, each model was trained with early stopping, suitable in case of overfitting, and the higher number of epochs in the proposed method demonstrates that early stopping did not detect overfitting, and consequently, the learning was optimal.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06353">Language-Assisted Human Part Motion Learning for Skeleton-Based Temporal Action Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Chen, Haoyu Ji, Zhiyong Wang, Benjamin Filtjens, Chunzhuo Wang, Weihong Ren, Bart Vanrumste, Honghai Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based Temporal Action Segmentation involves the dense action classification of variable-length skeleton sequences. Current approaches primarily apply graph-based networks to extract framewise, whole-body-level motion representations, and use one-hot encoded labels for model optimization. However, whole-body motion representations do not capture fine-grained part-level motion representations and the one-hot encoded labels neglect the intrinsic semantic relationships within the language-based action definitions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method named Language-assisted Human Part Motion Representation Learning (LPL), which contains a Disentangled Part Motion Encoder (DPE) to extract dual-level (i.e., part and whole-body) motion representations and a Language-assisted Distribution Alignment (LDA) strategy for optimizing spatial relations within representations. Specifically, after part-aware skeleton encoding via DPE, LDA generates dual-level action descriptions to construct a textual embedding space with the help of a large-scale language model. Then, LDA motivates the alignment of the embedding space between text descriptions and motions. This alignment allows LDA not only to enhance intra-class compactness but also to transfer the language-encoded semantic correlations among actions to skeleton-based motion learning. Moreover, we propose a simple yet efficient Semantic Offset Adapter to smooth the cross-domain misalignment. Our experiments indicate that LPL achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets (e.g., +4.4\% Accuracy, +5.6\% F1 on the PKU-MMD dataset). Moreover, LDA is compatible with existing methods and improves their performance (e.g., +4.8\% Accuracy, +4.3\% F1 on the LARa dataset) without additional inference costs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper delves into the interplay between vision backbones and optimizers, unvealing an inter-dependent phenomenon termed \textit{\textbf{b}ackbone-\textbf{o}ptimizer \textbf{c}oupling \textbf{b}ias} (BOCB). We observe that canonical CNNs, such as VGG and ResNet, exhibit a marked co-dependency with SGD families, while recent architectures like ViTs and ConvNeXt share a tight coupling with the adaptive learning rate ones. We further show that BOCB can be introduced by both optimizers and certain backbone designs and may significantly impact the pre-training and downstream fine-tuning of vision models. Through in-depth empirical analysis, we summarize takeaways on recommended optimizers and insights into robust vision backbone architectures. We hope this work can inspire the community to question long-held assumptions on backbones and optimizers, stimulate further explorations, and thereby contribute to more robust vision systems.

<p>Abstract: Adverse weather conditions pose a significant challenge to the widespread adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by impacting sensors like LiDARs and cameras. Even though Collaborative Perception (CP) improves AV perception in difficult conditions, existing CP datasets lack adverse weather conditions. To address this, we introduce Adver-City, the first open-source synthetic CP dataset focused on adverse weather conditions. Simulated in CARLA with OpenCDA, it contains over 24 thousand frames, over 890 thousand annotations, and 110 unique scenarios across six different weather conditions: clear weather, soft rain, heavy rain, fog, foggy heavy rain and, for the first time in a synthetic CP dataset, glare. It has six object categories including pedestrians and cyclists, and uses data from vehicles and roadside units featuring LiDARs, RGB and semantic segmentation cameras, GNSS, and IMUs. Its scenarios, based on real crash reports, depict the most relevant road configurations for adverse weather and poor visibility conditions, varying in object density, with both dense and sparse scenes, allowing for novel testing conditions of CP models. Benchmarks run on the dataset show that weather conditions created challenging conditions for perception models, reducing multi-modal object detection performance by up to 19%, while object density affected LiDAR-based detection by up to 29%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Yudong Xu, Scott Sanner, Elias Boutros Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Resani, Behrooz Nasihatkon</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-efficient and privacy-preserving continual learning in 3D object classification. Unlike conventional memory-based approaches in continual learning that require storing numerous exemplars, our method constructs a compact shape model for each class, retaining only the mean shape along with a few key modes of variation. This strategy not only enables the generation of diverse training samples while drastically reducing memory usage but also enhances privacy by eliminating the need to store original data. To further improve model robustness against input variations, an issue common in 3D domains due to the absence of strong backbones and limited training data, we incorporate Gradient Mode Regularization. This technique enhances model stability and broadens classification margins, resulting in accuracy improvements. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanNet datasets, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method consumes only 15% of the memory required by competing methods on the ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, while achieving comparable performance on the challenging ScanNet dataset with just 8.5% of the memory. These results underscore the scalability, effectiveness, and privacy-preserving strengths of our framework for 3D object classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Bai, Yang Zhou, Jun Zhou, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Daniel Shu Wei Ting, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) combine large language models with vision encoders, demonstrating promise across various tasks. However, they often underperform in task-specific applications due to domain gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning. We introduce VITask, a novel framework that enhances task-specific adaptability of VLMs by integrating task-specific models (TSMs). VITask employs three key strategies: exemplar prompting (EP), response distribution alignment (RDA), and contrastive response tuning (CRT) to improve the task-specific performance of VLMs by adjusting their response distributions. EP allows TSM features to guide VLMs, while RDA enables VLMs to adapt without TSMs during inference by learning from exemplar-prompted models. CRT further optimizes the ranking of correct image-response pairs, thereby reducing the risk of generating undesired responses. Experiments on 12 medical diagnosis datasets across 9 imaging modalities show that VITask outperforms both vanilla instruction-tuned VLMs and TSMs, showcasing its ability to integrate complementary features from both models effectively. Additionally, VITask offers practical advantages such as flexible TSM integration and robustness to incomplete instructions, making it a versatile and efficient solution for task-specific VLM tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Li, Zhouhui Lian</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of automatically synthesizing high-quality vector fonts, particularly for writing systems (e.g., Chinese) consisting of huge amounts of complex glyphs, remains unsolved. Existing font synthesis techniques fall into two categories: 1) methods that directly generate vector glyphs, and 2) methods that initially synthesize glyph images and then vectorize them. However, the first category often fails to construct complete and correct shapes for complex glyphs, while the latter struggles to efficiently synthesize high-resolution (i.e., 1024 $\times$ 1024 or higher) glyph images while preserving local details. In this paper, we introduce HFH-Font, a few-shot font synthesis method capable of efficiently generating high-resolution glyph images that can be converted into high-quality vector glyphs. More specifically, our method employs a diffusion model-based generative framework with component-aware conditioning to learn different levels of style information adaptable to varying input reference sizes. We also design a distillation module based on Score Distillation Sampling for 1-step fast inference, and a style-guided super-resolution module to refine and upscale low-resolution synthesis results. Extensive experiments, including a user study with professional font designers, have been conducted to demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing font synthesis approaches. Experimental results show that our method produces high-fidelity, high-resolution raster images which can be vectorized into high-quality vector fonts. Using our method, for the first time, large-scale Chinese vector fonts of a quality comparable to those manually created by professional font designers can be automatically generated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Liu, Yunyao Mao, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MotionRL, the first approach to utilize Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimizing text-to-motion generation tasks and aligning them with human preferences. Previous works focused on improving numerical performance metrics on the given datasets, often neglecting the variability and subjectivity of human feedback. In contrast, our novel approach uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune the motion generator based on human preferences prior knowledge of the human perception model, allowing it to generate motions that better align human preferences. In addition, MotionRL introduces a novel multi-objective optimization strategy to approximate Pareto optimality between text adherence, motion quality, and human preferences. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that MotionRL not only allows control over the generated results across different objectives but also significantly enhances performance across these metrics compared to other algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baiyu Pan, jichao jiao, Bowen Yao, Jianxin Pang, Jun Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The soft-argmax operation is widely adopted in neural network-based stereo matching methods to enable differentiable regression of disparity. However, network trained with soft-argmax is prone to being multimodal due to absence of explicit constraint to the shape of the probability distribution. Previous methods leverages Laplacian distribution and cross-entropy for training but failed to effectively improve the accuracy and even compromises the efficiency of the network. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the previous distribution-based methods and propose a novel supervision method for stereo matching, Sampling-Gaussian. We sample from the Gaussian distribution for supervision. Moreover, we interpret the training as minimizing the distance in vector space and propose a combined loss of L1 loss and cosine similarity loss. Additionally, we leveraged bilinear interpolation to upsample the cost volume. Our method can be directly applied to any soft-argmax-based stereo matching method without a reduction in efficiency. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our Sampling-Gaussian. The experimental results prove that we have achieved better accuracy on five baseline methods and two datasets. Our method is easy to implement, and the code is available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Ma, Fei Zhu, Zhun Zhong, Wenzhuo Liu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Constantly discovering novel concepts is crucial in evolving environments. This paper explores the underexplored task of Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD), which aims to incrementally discover new classes from unlabeled data while maintaining the ability to recognize previously learned classes. Although several settings are proposed to study the C-GCD task, they have limitations that do not reflect real-world scenarios. We thus study a more practical C-GCD setting, which includes more new classes to be discovered over a longer period, without storing samples of past classes. In C-GCD, the model is initially trained on labeled data of known classes, followed by multiple incremental stages where the model is fed with unlabeled data containing both old and new classes. The core challenge involves two conflicting objectives: discover new classes and prevent forgetting old ones. We delve into the conflicts and identify that models are susceptible to prediction bias and hardness bias. To address these issues, we introduce a debiased learning framework namely Happy. For the prediction bias, we first introduce clustering-guided initialization to provide robust features. In addition, we propose soft entropy regularization to assign appropriate probabilities to new classes, which can significantly enhance the clustering performance of new classes. For the harness bias, we present the hardness-aware prototype sampling, which can effectively reduce the forgetting issue for previously seen classes, especially for difficult classes. Experimental results demonstrate our method proficiently manages the conflicts of C-GCD and achieves remarkable performance across various datasets, e.g., 7.5% overall gains on ImageNet-100.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-Yuan Huang, Haofan Wang, Qixun Wang, Xu Bai, Hao Ai, Peng Xing, Jen-Tse Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling test-time unknown degradation is the major challenge in Blind Image Restoration (BIR), necessitating high model generalization. An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianyu Hu, Tongkai Shi, Wei Feng, Fanhua Shang, Liang Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models have shown excellent performance over a series of tasks powered by the large corpus of paired multimodal training data. Generally, they are always assumed to receive modality-complete inputs. However, this simple assumption may not always hold in the real world due to privacy constraints or collection difficulty, where models pretrained on modality-complete data easily demonstrate degraded performance on missing-modality cases. To handle this issue, we refer to prompt learning to adapt large pretrained multimodal models to handle missing-modality scenarios by regarding different missing cases as different types of input. Instead of only prepending independent prompts to the intermediate layers, we present to leverage the correlations between prompts and input features and excavate the relationships between different layers of prompts to carefully design the instructions. We also incorporate the complementary semantics of different modalities to guide the prompting design for each modality. Extensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the previous approaches upon different missing scenarios. Plentiful ablations are further given to show the generalizability and reliability of our method upon different modality-missing ratios and types.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06576">On The Relationship between Visual Anomaly-free and Anomalous Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Riya Sadrani, Hrishikesh Sharma, Ayush Bachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly Detection is an important problem within computer vision, having variety of real-life applications. Yet, the current set of solutions to this problem entail known, systematic shortcomings. Specifically, contemporary surface Anomaly Detection task assumes the presence of multiple specific anomaly classes e.g. cracks, rusting etc., unlike one-class classification model of past. However, building a deep learning model in such setup remains a challenge because anomalies arise rarely, and hence anomaly samples are quite scarce. Transfer learning has been a preferred paradigm in such situations. But the typical source domains with large dataset sizes e.g. ImageNet, JFT-300M, LAION-2B do not correlate well with the domain of surfaces and materials, an important premise of transfer learning. In this paper, we make an important hypothesis and show, by exhaustive experimentation, that the space of anomaly-free visual patterns of the normal samples correlates well with each of the various spaces of anomalous patterns of the class-specific anomaly samples. The first results of using this hypothesis in transfer learning have indeed been quite encouraging. We expect that finding such a simple closeby domain that readily entails large number of samples, and which also oftentimes shows interclass separability though with narrow margins, will be a useful discovery. Especially, it is expected to improve domain adaptation for anomaly detection, and few-shot learning for anomaly detection, making in-the-wild anomaly detection realistically possible in future.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06593">Towards Natural Image Matting in the Wild via Real-Scenario Prior</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihao Xia, Yu Liang, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Qianru Sun, Yang Tang, Bo Li, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches attempt to adapt powerful interactive segmentation models, such as SAM, to interactive matting and fine-tune the models based on synthetic matting datasets. However, models trained on synthetic data fail to generalize to complex and occlusion scenes. We address this challenge by proposing a new matting dataset based on the COCO dataset, namely COCO-Matting. Specifically, the construction of our COCO-Matting includes accessory fusion and mask-to-matte, which selects real-world complex images from COCO and converts semantic segmentation masks to matting labels. The built COCO-Matting comprises an extensive collection of 38,251 human instance-level alpha mattes in complex natural scenarios. Furthermore, existing SAM-based matting methods extract intermediate features and masks from a frozen SAM and only train a lightweight matting decoder by end-to-end matting losses, which do not fully exploit the potential of the pre-trained SAM. Thus, we propose SEMat which revamps the network architecture and training objectives. For network architecture, the proposed feature-aligned transformer learns to extract fine-grained edge and transparency features. The proposed matte-aligned decoder aims to segment matting-specific objects and convert coarse masks into high-precision mattes. For training objectives, the proposed regularization and trimap loss aim to retain the prior from the pre-trained model and push the matting logits extracted from the mask decoder to contain trimap-based semantic information. Extensive experiments across seven diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, proving its efficacy in interactive natural image matting. We open-source our code, models, and dataset at https://github.com/XiaRho/SEMat.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyong Wang, Yujie Liu, Mingyue Li, Wenxin Zhang, Zongmin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In occluded person re-identification(ReID), severe occlusions lead to a significant amount of irrelevant information that hinders the accurate identification of individuals. These irrelevant cues primarily stem from background interference and occluding interference, adversely affecting the final retrieval results. Traditional discriminative models, which rely on the specific content and positions of the images, often misclassify in cases of occlusion. To address these limitations, we propose the Data Distribution Reconstruction Network (DDRN), a generative model that leverages data distribution to filter out irrelevant details, enhancing overall feature perception ability and reducing irrelevant feature interference. Additionally, severe occlusions lead to the complexity of the feature space. To effectively handle this, we design a multi-center approach through the proposed Hierarchical SubcenterArcface (HS-Arcface) loss function, which can better approximate complex feature spaces. On the Occluded-Duke dataset, we achieved a mAP of 62.4\% (+1.1\%) and a rank-1 accuracy of 71.3\% (+0.6\%), surpassing the latest state-of-the-art methods(FRT) significantly.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and affordable indoor 3D reconstruction is critical for effective robot navigation and interaction. Traditional LiDAR-based mapping provides high precision but is costly, heavy, and power-intensive, with limited ability for novel view rendering. Vision-based mapping, while cost-effective and capable of capturing visual data, often struggles with high-quality 3D reconstruction due to sparse point clouds. We propose ES-Gaussian, an end-to-end system using a low-altitude camera and single-line LiDAR for high-quality 3D indoor reconstruction. Our system features Visual Error Construction (VEC) to enhance sparse point clouds by identifying and correcting areas with insufficient geometric detail from 2D error maps. Additionally, we introduce a novel 3DGS initialization method guided by single-line LiDAR, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view setups and enabling effective reconstruction in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experimental results on our new Dreame-SR dataset and a publicly available dataset demonstrate that ES-Gaussian outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06618">Decomposing Relationship from 1-to-N into N 1-to-1 for Text-Video Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xiao, Zhenzhen Hu, Jia Li, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) has seen substantial advancements in recent years, fueled by the utilization of pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, achieving accurate matching in TVR remains challenging due to inherent disparities between video and textual modalities and irregularities in data representation. In this paper, we propose Text-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the conventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships. By replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not only broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each text proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by mechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's direction and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only facilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the disparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three representative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an improvement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline. TV-ProxyNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on MSRVTT and ActivityNet Captions, and a 2.0% improvement on DiDeMo compared to existing methods, validating our approach's ability to enhance semantic mapping and reduce error propensity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Ding, Bolian Li, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones for multimodal intelligence, yet significant safety challenges limit their real-world application. While textual inputs are often effectively safeguarded, adversarial visual inputs can easily bypass VLM defense mechanisms. Existing defense methods are either resource-intensive, requiring substantial data and compute, or fail to simultaneously ensure safety and usefulness in responses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-phase inference-time alignment framework, Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA): 1) Evaluating input visual contents and output responses to establish a robust safety awareness in multimodal settings, and 2) Aligning unsafe behaviors at both shallow and deep levels by conditioning the VLMs' generative distribution with an interference prefix and performing sentence-level best-of-N to search the most harmless and helpful generation paths. Extensive experiments show that ETA outperforms baseline methods in terms of harmlessness, helpfulness, and efficiency, reducing the unsafe rate by 87.5% in cross-modality attacks and achieving 96.6% win-ties in GPT-4 helpfulness evaluation.

<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a critical technique for effective scene understanding. Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Liu, Boyu Diao, Libo Huang, Zijia An, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is designed to learn new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an effective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. However, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based methods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems in resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying sensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient elimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to enhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the input features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map the original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively reducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the feature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct classes for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference of output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes across various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the feature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various rehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge environments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency. Specifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to 6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6$\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Ma, Xuefei Ning, Dongrui Liu, Li Niu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are trained by learning a sequence of models that reverse each step of noise corruption. Typically, the model parameters are fully shared across multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency. However, since the denoising tasks differ at each timestep, the gradients computed at different timesteps may conflict, potentially degrading the overall performance of image generation. To solve this issue, this work proposes a Decouple-then-Merge (DeMe) framework, which begins with a pretrained model and finetunes separate models tailored to specific timesteps. We introduce several improved techniques during the finetuning stage to promote effective knowledge sharing while minimizing training interference across timesteps. Finally, after finetuning, these separate models can be merged into a single model in the parameter space, ensuring efficient and practical inference. Experimental results show significant generation quality improvements upon 6 benchmarks including Stable Diffusion on COCO30K, ImageNet1K, PartiPrompts, and DDPM on LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, and CIFAR10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Yudong Yang, Jimin Zhuang, Guangzhi Sun, Wei Li, Zujun Ma, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimization (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we introduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the process. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning abilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO LLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised labels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmark among models of similar size.

<p>Abstract: No-reference bitstream-layer point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) can be deployed without full decoding at any network node to achieve real-time quality monitoring. In this work, we develop the first PCQA model dedicated to Trisoup-Lifting encoded 3D point clouds by analyzing bitstreams without full decoding. Specifically, we investigate the relationship among texture bitrate per point (TBPP), texture complexity (TC) and texture quantization parameter (TQP) while geometry encoding is lossless. Subsequently, we estimate TC by utilizing TQP and TBPP. Then, we establish a texture distortion evaluation model based on TC, TBPP and TQP. Ultimately, by integrating this texture distortion model with a geometry attenuation factor, a function of trisoupNodeSizeLog2 (tNSL), we acquire a comprehensive NR bitstream-layer PCQA model named streamPCQ-TL. In addition, this work establishes a database named WPC6.0, the first and largest PCQA database dedicated to Trisoup-Lifting encoding mode, encompassing 400 distorted point clouds with both 4 geometric multiplied by 5 texture distortion levels. Experiment results on M-PCCD, ICIP2020 and the proposed WPC6.0 database suggest that the proposed streamPCQ-TL model exhibits robust and notable performance in contrast to existing advanced PCQA metrics, particularly in terms of computational cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Friedhelm Hamann, Suman Ghosh, Ignacio Juarez Martinez, Tom Hart, Alex Kacelnik, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired vision sensors that measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of images at a given frame rate. They offer promising advantages, namely a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. We propose approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier Transform. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, we apply our approaches to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for "ecstatic display", a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. We find that our approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. We hope this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Wang, Chaohu Liu, Yanqiu Qu, Haoyu Cao, Deqiang Jiang, Linli Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) integrate visual information into large language models, showcasing remarkable multi-modal conversational capabilities. However, the visual modules introduces new challenges in terms of robustness for LVLMs, as attackers can craft adversarial images that are visually clean but may mislead the model to generate incorrect answers. In general, LVLMs rely on vision encoders to transform images into visual tokens, which are crucial for the language models to perceive image contents effectively. Therefore, we are curious about one question: Can LVLMs still generate correct responses when the encoded visual tokens are attacked and disrupting the visual information? To this end, we propose a non-targeted attack method referred to as VT-Attack (Visual Tokens Attack), which constructs adversarial examples from multiple perspectives, with the goal of comprehensively disrupting feature representations and inherent relationships as well as the semantic properties of visual tokens output by image encoders. Using only access to the image encoder in the proposed attack, the generated adversarial examples exhibit transferability across diverse LVLMs utilizing the same image encoder and generality across different tasks. Extensive experiments validate the superior attack performance of the VT-Attack over baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in attacking LVLMs with image encoders, which in turn can provide guidance on the robustness of LVLMs, particularly in terms of the stability of the visual feature space.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of aerial image datasets, dense stereo matching has gained tremendous progress. This work analyses dense stereo correspondence analysis on aerial images using different techniques. Traditional methods, optimization based methods and learning based methods have been implemented and compared here for aerial images. For traditional methods, we implemented the architecture of Stereo SGBM while using different cost functions to get an understanding of their performance on aerial datasets. Analysis of most of the methods in standard datasets has shown good performance, however in case of aerial dataset, not much benchmarking is available. Visual qualitative and quantitative analysis has been carried out for two stereo aerial datasets in order to compare different cost functions and techniques for the purpose of depth estimation from stereo images. Using existing pre-trained models, recent learning based architectures have also been tested on stereo pairs along with different cost functions in SGBM. The outputs and given ground truth are compared using MSE, SSIM and other error metrics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06719">Suppress Content Shift: Better Diffusion Features via Off-the-Shelf Generation Techniques</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinfeng Zhu, Jiaze Cao, Yuanzhi Cai, Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud semantic segmentation, the process of classifying each point into predefined categories, is essential for 3D scene understanding. While image-based segmentation is widely adopted due to its maturity, methods relying solely on RGB information often suffer from degraded performance due to color inaccuracies. Recent advancements have incorporated additional features such as intensity and geometric information, yet RGB channels continue to negatively impact segmentation accuracy when errors in colorization occur. Despite this, previous studies have not rigorously quantified the effects of erroneous colorization on segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical approach to evaluate the impact of inaccurate RGB information on image-based point cloud segmentation. We categorize RGB inaccuracies into two types: incorrect color information and similar color information. Our results demonstrate that both types of color inaccuracies significantly degrade segmentation accuracy, with similar color errors particularly affecting the extraction of geometric features. These findings highlight the critical need to reassess the role of RGB information in point cloud segmentation and its implications for future algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhui Ye, Tianyun Zhong, Yi Ren, Ziyue Jiang, Jiawei Huang, Rongjie Huang, Jinglin Liu, Jinzheng He, Chen Zhang, Zehan Wang, Xize Chen, Xiang Yin, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Talking face generation (TFG) aims to animate a target identity's face to create realistic talking videos. Personalized TFG is a variant that emphasizes the perceptual identity similarity of the synthesized result (from the perspective of appearance and talking style). While previous works typically solve this problem by learning an individual neural radiance field (NeRF) for each identity to implicitly store its static and dynamic information, we find it inefficient and non-generalized due to the per-identity-per-training framework and the limited training data. To this end, we propose MimicTalk, the first attempt that exploits the rich knowledge from a NeRF-based person-agnostic generic model for improving the efficiency and robustness of personalized TFG. To be specific, (1) we first come up with a person-agnostic 3D TFG model as the base model and propose to adapt it into a specific identity; (2) we propose a static-dynamic-hybrid adaptation pipeline to help the model learn the personalized static appearance and facial dynamic features; (3) To generate the facial motion of the personalized talking style, we propose an in-context stylized audio-to-motion model that mimics the implicit talking style provided in the reference video without information loss by an explicit style representation. The adaptation process to an unseen identity can be performed in 15 minutes, which is 47 times faster than previous person-dependent methods. Experiments show that our MimicTalk surpasses previous baselines regarding video quality, efficiency, and expressiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hari Prabhat Gupta, Rahul Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment, human life, and property. Early detection and response are crucial to mitigating the impact of these disasters. However, traditional forest fire detection methods are often hindered by our reliability on manual observation and satellite imagery with low spatial resolution. This paper emphasizes the role of transfer learning in enhancing forest fire detection in India, particularly in overcoming data collection challenges and improving model accuracy across various regions. We compare traditional learning methods with transfer learning, focusing on the unique challenges posed by regional differences in terrain, climate, and vegetation. Transfer learning can be categorized into several types based on the similarity between the source and target tasks, as well as the type of knowledge transferred. One key method is utilizing pre-trained models for efficient transfer learning, which significantly reduces the need for extensive labeled data. We outline the transfer learning process, demonstrating how researchers can adapt pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 for specific tasks such as forest fire detection. Finally, we present experimental results from training and evaluating a deep learning model using the Uttarakhand forest fire dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of transfer learning in this context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Li, Yiming Chen, Peidong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D/3D generative techniques have facilitated the generation of dynamic 3D objects from monocular videos. Previous methods mainly rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices. In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm, which is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score distillation loss as well as other regularizers in a two-stage manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of our method. Furthermore, our method is compatible with modern graphic pipelines, showcasing its potential in the 3D gaming and film industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keliang Li, Zaifei Yang, Jiahe Zhao, Hongze Shen, Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The significant advancements in visual understanding and instruction following from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have opened up more possibilities for broader applications in diverse and universal human-centric scenarios. However, existing image-text data may not support the precise modality alignment and integration of multi-grained information, which is crucial for human-centric visual understanding. In this paper, we introduce HERM-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the human-centric understanding capabilities of MLLMs. Our work reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in understanding complex human-centric scenarios. To address these challenges, we present HERM-100K, a comprehensive dataset with multi-level human-centric annotations, aimed at enhancing MLLMs' training. Furthermore, we develop HERM-7B, a MLLM that leverages enhanced training data from HERM-100K. Evaluations on HERM-Bench demonstrate that HERM-7B significantly outperforms existing MLLMs across various human-centric dimensions, reflecting the current inadequacy of data annotations used in MLLM training for human-centric visual understanding. This research emphasizes the importance of specialized datasets and benchmarks in advancing the MLLMs' capabilities for human-centric understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Xie, Weijia Zhang, Zhongdao Wang, Chao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in State Space Models, notably Mamba, have demonstrated superior performance over the dominant Transformer models, particularly in reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Yet, difficulties in adapting Mamba from language to vision tasks arise due to the distinct characteristics of visual data, such as the spatial locality and adjacency within images and large variations in information granularity across visual tokens. Existing vision Mamba approaches either flatten tokens into sequences in a raster scan fashion, which breaks the local adjacency of images, or manually partition tokens into windows, which limits their long-range modeling and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a new vision Mamba model, coined QuadMamba, that effectively captures local dependencies of varying granularities via quadtree-based image partition and scan. Concretely, our lightweight quadtree-based scan module learns to preserve the 2D locality of spatial regions within learned window quadrants. The module estimates the locality score of each token from their features, before adaptively partitioning tokens into window quadrants. An omnidirectional window shifting scheme is also introduced to capture more intact and informative features across different local regions. To make the discretized quadtree partition end-to-end trainable, we further devise a sequence masking strategy based on Gumbel-Softmax and its straight-through gradient estimator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06811">Rethinking the Evaluation of Visible and Infrared Image Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayan Guan, Yixuan Wu, Tianzhu Liu, Alex C. Kot, Yanfeng Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visible and Infrared Image Fusion (VIF) has garnered significant interest across a wide range of high-level vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the evaluation of VIF methods remains challenging due to the absence of ground truth. This paper proposes a Segmentation-oriented Evaluation Approach (SEA) to assess VIF methods by incorporating the semantic segmentation task and leveraging segmentation labels available in latest VIF datasets. Specifically, SEA utilizes universal segmentation models, capable of handling diverse images and classes, to predict segmentation outputs from fused images and compare these outputs with segmentation labels. Our evaluation of recent VIF methods using SEA reveals that their performance is comparable or even inferior to using visible images only, despite nearly half of the infrared images demonstrating better performance than visible images. Further analysis indicates that the two metrics most correlated to our SEA are the gradient-based fusion metric $Q_{\text{ABF}}$ and the visual information fidelity metric $Q_{\text{VIFF}}$ in conventional VIF evaluation metrics, which can serve as proxies when segmentation labels are unavailable. We hope that our evaluation will guide the development of novel and practical VIF methods. The code has been released in \url{https://github.com/Yixuan-2002/SEA/}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Narjes Benameur, Ramzi Mahmoudi, Mohamed Deriche, Amira fayouka, Imene Masmoudi, Nessrine Zoghlami</p>
<p>Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most important clinical parameter of cardiovascular function. The accuracy in estimating this parameter is highly dependent upon the precise segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) structure at the end diastole and systole phases. Therefore, it is crucial to develop robust algorithms for the precise segmentation of the heart structure during different phases. Methodology: In this work, an improved 3D UNet model is introduced to segment the myocardium and LV, while excluding papillary muscles, as per the recommendation of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. For the practical testing of the proposed framework, a total of 8,400 cardiac MRI images were collected and analysed from the military hospital in Tunis (HMPIT), as well as the popular ACDC public dataset. As performance metrics, we used the Dice coefficient and the F1 score for validation/testing of the LV and the myocardium segmentation. Results: The data was split into 70%, 10%, and 20% for training, validation, and testing, respectively. It is worth noting that the proposed segmentation model was tested across three axis views: basal, medio basal and apical at two different cardiac phases: end diastole and end systole instances. The experimental results showed a Dice index of 0.965 and 0.945, and an F1 score of 0.801 and 0.799, at the end diastolic and systolic phases, respectively. Additionally, clinical evaluation outcomes revealed a significant difference in the LVEF and other clinical parameters when the papillary muscles were included or excluded.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled a wide range of works exploiting their ability to generate high-volume, high-quality data for use in various downstream tasks. One subclass of such models, dubbed Layout-to-Image Synthesis (LIS), learns to generate images conditioned on a spatial layout (bounding boxes, masks, poses, etc.) and has shown a promising ability to generate realistic images, albeit with limited layout-adherence. Moreover, the question of how to effectively transfer those models for scalable augmentation of few-shot detection data remains unanswered. Thus, we propose a collaborative framework employing a Large Language Model (LLM) and an LIS model for enhancing few-shot detection beyond state-of-the-art generative augmentation approaches. We leverage LLM's reasoning ability to extrapolate the spatial prior of the annotation space by generating new bounding boxes given only a few example annotations. Additionally, we introduce our novel layout-aware CLIP score for sample ranking, enabling tight coupling between generated layouts and images. Significant improvements on COCO few-shot benchmarks are observed. With our approach, a YOLOX-S baseline is boosted by more than 140%, 50%, 35% in mAP on the COCO 5-,10-, and 30-shot settings, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Kang, Qingpeng Li, Leyuan Fang, Jian Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Concealed object detection (COD) in cluttered scenes is significant for various image processing applications. However, due to that concealed objects are always similar to their background, it is extremely hard to distinguish them. Here, the major obstacle is the tiny feature differences between the inside and outside object boundary region, which makes it trouble for existing COD methods to achieve accurate results. In this paper, considering that the surrounding environment information can be well utilized to identify the concealed objects, and thus, we propose a novel deep Surrounding-Aware Network, namely SurANet, for COD tasks, which introduces surrounding information into feature extraction and loss function to improve the discrimination. First, we enhance the semantics of feature maps using differential fusion of surrounding features to highlight concealed objects. Next, a Surrounding-Aware Contrastive Loss is applied to identify the concealed object via learning surrounding feature maps contrastively. Then, SurANet can be trained end-to-end with high efficiency via our proposed Spatial-Compressed Correlation Transmission strategy after our investigation of feature dynamics, and extensive experiments improve that such features can be well reserved respectively. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SurANet outperforms state-of-the-art COD methods on multiple real datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao-Xiang Zhang, Yu Ran, Weixuan Tang, Yuan-Gen Wang, Qingxiao Guan, Chunsheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential surge in video traffic has intensified the imperative for Video Quality Assessment (VQA). Leveraging cutting-edge architectures, current VQA models have achieved human-comparable accuracy. However, recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of existing VQA models against adversarial attacks. To establish a reliable and practical assessment system, a secure VQA model capable of resisting such malicious attacks is urgently demanded. Unfortunately, no attempt has been made to explore this issue. This paper first attempts to investigate general adversarial defense principles, aiming at endowing existing VQA models with security. Specifically, we first introduce random spatial grid sampling on the video frame for intra-frame defense. Then, we design pixel-wise randomization through a guardian map, globally neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we extract temporal information from the video sequence as compensation for inter-frame defense. Building upon these principles, we present a novel VQA framework from the security-oriented perspective, termed SecureVQA. Extensive experiments indicate that SecureVQA sets a new benchmark in security while achieving competitive VQA performance compared with state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies delve deeper into analyzing the principles of SecureVQA, demonstrating their generalization and contributions to the security of leading VQA models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of pattern recognition, achieving high accuracy is essential. While training a model to recognize different complex images, it is vital to fine-tune the model to achieve the highest accuracy possible. One strategy for fine-tuning a model involves changing its activation function. Most pre-trained models use ReLU as their default activation function, but switching to a different activation function like Hard-Swish could be beneficial. This study evaluates the performance of models using ReLU, Swish and Hard-Swish activation functions across diverse image datasets. Our results show a 2.06% increase in accuracy for models on the CIFAR-10 dataset and a 0.30% increase in accuracy for models on the ATLAS dataset. Modifying the activation functions in architecture of pre-trained models lead to improved overall accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungho Lee, Hwijeong Lee, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes.

This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avik Pal, Max van Spengler, Guido Maria D'Amely di Melendugno, Alessandro Flaborea, Fabio Galasso, Pascal Mettes</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-text representation learning forms a cornerstone in vision-language models, where pairs of images and textual descriptions are contrastively aligned in a shared embedding space. Since visual and textual concepts are naturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve as a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with strong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to fully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by looking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment Learning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is not only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object boxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be obtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available localized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images, image boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and entailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic vision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the proposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean CLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot and retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06940">Representation Alignment for Generation: Training Diffusion Transformers Is Easier Than You Think</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihyun Yu, Sangkyung Kwak, Huiwon Jang, Jongheon Jeong, Jonathan Huang, Jinwoo Shin, Saining Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06964">Bridge the Points: Graph-based Few-shot Segment Anything Semantically</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Zhang, Guangyu Gao, Jianbo Jiao, Chi Harold Liu, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in large-scale pre-training techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of vision foundation models, notably the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which can generate precise masks based on point and box prompts. Recent studies extend SAM to Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), focusing on prompt generation for SAM-based automatic semantic segmentation. However, these methods struggle with selecting suitable prompts, require specific hyperparameter settings for different scenarios, and experience prolonged one-shot inference times due to the overuse of SAM, resulting in low efficiency and limited automation ability. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach based on graph analysis. In particular, a Positive-Negative Alignment module dynamically selects the point prompts for generating masks, especially uncovering the potential of the background context as the negative reference. Another subsequent Point-Mask Clustering module aligns the granularity of masks and selected points as a directed graph, based on mask coverage over points. These points are then aggregated by decomposing the weakly connected components of the directed graph in an efficient manner, constructing distinct natural clusters. Finally, the positive and overshooting gating, benefiting from graph-based granularity alignment, aggregate high-confident masks and filter out the false-positive masks for final prediction, reducing the usage of additional hyperparameters and redundant mask generation. Extensive experimental analysis across standard FSS, One-shot Part Segmentation, and Cross Domain FSS datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, surpassing state-of-the-art generalist models with a mIoU of 58.7% on COCO-20i and 35.2% on LVIS-92i.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyue Li, Shuoyi Chen, Mang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Wildlife ReID involves utilizing visual technology to identify specific individuals of wild animals in different scenarios, holding significant importance for wildlife conservation, ecological research, and environmental monitoring. Existing wildlife ReID methods are predominantly tailored to specific species, exhibiting limited applicability. Although some approaches leverage extensively studied person ReID techniques, they struggle to address the unique challenges posed by wildlife. Therefore, in this paper, we present a unified, multi-species general framework for wildlife ReID. Given that high-frequency information is a consistent representation of unique features in various species, significantly aiding in identifying contours and details such as fur textures, we propose the Adaptive High-Frequency Transformer model with the goal of enhancing high-frequency information learning. To mitigate the inevitable high-frequency interference in the wilderness environment, we introduce an object-aware high-frequency selection strategy to adaptively capture more valuable high-frequency components. Notably, we unify the experimental settings of multiple wildlife datasets for ReID, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art ReID methods. In domain generalization scenarios, our approach demonstrates robust generalization to unknown species.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Chen, Haiyong Luo, Fang Zhao, Jingze Yu, Yupeng Jia, Juan Wang, Xuepeng Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular depth estimation, enabled by self-supervised learning, is a key technique for 3D perception in computer vision. However, it faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, which encompass adverse weather variations, motion blur, as well as scenes with poor lighting conditions at night. Our research reveals that we can divide monocular depth estimation into three sub-problems: depth structure consistency, local texture disambiguation, and semantic-structural correlation. Our approach tackles the non-robustness of existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation models to interference textures by adopting a structure-centered perspective and utilizing the scene structure characteristics demonstrated by semantics and illumination. We devise a novel approach to reduce over-reliance on local textures, enhancing robustness against missing or interfering patterns. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic expert model as the teacher and construct inter-model feature dependencies via learnable isomorphic graphs to enable aggregation of semantic structural knowledge. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art out-of-distribution monocular depth estimation performance across a range of public adverse scenario datasets. It demonstrates notable scalability and compatibility, without necessitating extensive model engineering. This showcases the potential for customizing models for diverse industrial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-view consistency remains a challenge for image diffusion models. Even within the Text-to-Texture problem, where perfect geometric correspondences are known a priori, many methods fail to yield aligned predictions across views, necessitating non-trivial fusion methods to incorporate the results onto the original mesh. We explore this issue for a Collaborative Control workflow specifically in PBR Text-to-Texture. Collaborative Control directly models PBR image probability distributions, including normal bump maps; to our knowledge, the only diffusion model to directly output full PBR stacks. We discuss the design decisions involved in making this model multi-view consistent, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ablation studies, as well as practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Hein, Zhihong Chen, Sophie Ostmeier, Justin Xu, Maya Varma, Eduardo Pontes Reis, Arne Edward Michalson, Christian Bluethgen, Hyun Joo Shin, Curtis Langlotz, Akshay S Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiologists play a crucial role by translating medical images into medical reports. However, the field faces staffing shortages and increasing workloads. While automated approaches using vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as assistants, they require exceptionally high accuracy. Most current VLMs in radiology rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Meanwhile, in the general domain, additional preference fine-tuning has become standard practice. The challenge in radiology lies in the prohibitive cost of obtaining radiologist feedback. We propose a scalable automated preference alignment technique for VLMs in radiology, focusing on chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. Our method leverages publicly available datasets with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, eliminating the need for additional expert radiologist feedback. We evaluate and benchmark five direct alignment algorithms (DAAs). Our results show up to a 57.4% improvement in average GREEN scores, a LLM-based metric for evaluating CXR reports, and a 9.2% increase in an average across six metrics (domain specific and general), compared to the SFT baseline. We study reward overoptimization via length exploitation, with reports lengthening by up to 3.2x. To assess a potential alignment tax, we benchmark on six additional diverse tasks, finding no significant degradations. A reader study involving four board-certified radiologists indicates win rates of up to 0.62 over the SFT baseline, while significantly penalizing verbosity. Our analysis provides actionable insights for the development of VLMs in high-stakes fields like radiology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyuan Lu, Shujie Miao, Wai Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: How to evaluate large language models (LLMs) cleanly has been established as an important research era to genuinely report the performance of possibly contaminated LLMs. Yet, how to cleanly evaluate the visual language models (VLMs) is an under-studied problem. We propose a novel approach to achieve such goals through data augmentation methods on the visual input information. We then craft a new visual clean evaluation benchmark with thousands of data instances. Through extensive experiments, we found that the traditional visual data augmentation methods are useful, but they are at risk of being used as a part of the training data as a workaround. We further propose using BGR augmentation to switch the colour channel of the visual information. We found that it is a simple yet effective method for reducing the effect of data contamination and fortunately, it is also harmful to be used as a data augmentation method during training. It means that it is hard to integrate such data augmentation into training by malicious trainers and it could be a promising technique to cleanly evaluate visual LLMs. Our code, data, and model weights will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Lin, Shengji Tang, Chong Yu, Peng Ye, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, differentiable mask pruning methods optimize the continuous relaxation architecture (soft network) as the proxy of the pruned discrete network (hard network) for superior sub-architecture search. However, due to the agnostic impact of the discretization process, the hard network struggles with the equivalent representational capacity as the soft network, namely discretization gap, which severely spoils the pruning performance. In this paper, we first investigate the discretization gap and propose a novel structural differentiable mask pruning framework named S2HPruner to bridge the discretization gap in a one-stage manner. In the training procedure, SH2Pruner forwards both the soft network and its corresponding hard network, then distills the hard network under the supervision of the soft network. To optimize the mask and prevent performance degradation, we propose a decoupled bidirectional knowledge distillation. It blocks the weight updating from the hard to the soft network while maintaining the gradient corresponding to the mask. Compared with existing pruning arts, S2HPruner achieves surpassing pruning performance without fine-tuning on comprehensive benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet with a variety of network architectures. Besides, investigation and analysis experiments explain the effectiveness of S2HPruner. Codes will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces TinyEmo, a family of small multi-modal language models for emotional reasoning and classification. Our approach features: (1) a synthetic emotional instruct dataset for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages, (2) a Metric Projector that delegates classification from the language model allowing for more efficient training and inference, (3) a multi-modal large language model (MM-LLM) for emotional reasoning, and (4) a semi-automated framework for bias detection. TinyEmo is able to perform emotion classification and emotional reasoning, all while using substantially fewer parameters than comparable models. This efficiency allows us to freely incorporate more diverse emotional datasets, enabling strong performance on classification tasks, with our smallest model (700M parameters) outperforming larger state-of-the-art models based on general-purpose MM-LLMs with over 7B parameters. Additionally, the Metric Projector allows for interpretability and indirect bias detection in large models without additional training, offering an approach to understand and improve AI systems.

<p>Abstract: We introduce Pixtral-12B, a 12--billion-parameter multimodal language model. Pixtral-12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \& Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral-12B is released under Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although it is traditionally believed that lossy image compression, such as JPEG compression, has a negative impact on the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), it is shown by recent works that well-crafted JPEG compression can actually improve the performance of deep learning (DL). Inspired by this, we propose JPEG-DL, a novel DL framework that prepends any underlying DNN architecture with a trainable JPEG compression layer. To make the quantization operation in JPEG compression trainable, a new differentiable soft quantizer is employed at the JPEG layer, and then the quantization operation and underlying DNN are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that in comparison with the standard DL, JPEG-DL delivers significant accuracy improvements across various datasets and model architectures while enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks. Particularly, on some fine-grained image classification datasets, JPEG-DL can increase prediction accuracy by as much as 20.9%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Wang, Donglin Yang, Ziqin Wang, Hohin Kwan, Jinyu Chen, Wenjun Wu, Hongsheng Li, Yue Liao, Si Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing agents capable of navigating to a target location based on language instructions and visual information, known as vision-language navigation (VLN), has attracted widespread interest. Most research has focused on ground-based agents, while UAV-based VLN remains relatively underexplored. Recent efforts in UAV vision-language navigation predominantly adopt ground-based VLN settings, relying on predefined discrete action spaces and neglecting the inherent disparities in agent movement dynamics and the complexity of navigation tasks between ground and aerial environments. To address these disparities and challenges, we propose solutions from three perspectives: platform, benchmark, and methodology. To enable realistic UAV trajectory simulation in VLN tasks, we propose the OpenUAV platform, which features diverse environments, realistic flight control, and extensive algorithmic support. We further construct a target-oriented VLN dataset consisting of approximately 12k trajectories on this platform, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for realistic UAV VLN tasks. To tackle the challenges posed by complex aerial environments, we propose an assistant-guided UAV object search benchmark called UAV-Need-Help, which provides varying levels of guidance information to help UAVs better accomplish realistic VLN tasks. We also propose a UAV navigation LLM that, given multi-view images, task descriptions, and assistant instructions, leverages the multimodal understanding capabilities of the MLLM to jointly process visual and textual information, and performs hierarchical trajectory generation. The evaluation results of our method significantly outperform the baseline models, while there remains a considerable gap between our results and those achieved by human operators, underscoring the challenge presented by the UAV-Need-Help task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language plays a vital role in the realm of human motion. Existing methods have largely depended on CLIP text embeddings for motion generation, yet they fall short in effectively aligning language and motion due to CLIP's pretraining on static image-text pairs. This work introduces LaMP, a novel Language-Motion Pretraining model, which transitions from a language-vision to a more suitable language-motion latent space. It addresses key limitations by generating motion-informative text embeddings, significantly enhancing the relevance and semantics of generated motion sequences. With LaMP, we advance three key tasks: text-to-motion generation, motion-text retrieval, and motion captioning through aligned language-motion representation learning. For generation, we utilize LaMP to provide the text condition instead of CLIP, and an autoregressive masked prediction is designed to achieve mask modeling without rank collapse in transformers. For retrieval, motion features from LaMP's motion transformer interact with query tokens to retrieve text features from the text transformer, and vice versa. For captioning, we finetune a large language model with the language-informative motion features to develop a strong motion captioning model. In addition, we introduce the LaMP-BertScore metric to assess the alignment of generated motions with textual descriptions. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods across all three tasks. The code of our method will be made public.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other critical aspects such as fairness, multilinguality, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various datasets to cover one or more of the 9 aspects: visual perception, knowledge, reasoning, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 22 VLMs on 21 existing datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the fact that efficiency-focused models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku or Gemini 1.5 Flash) perform significantly worse than their full models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the bias benchmark but not when evaluated on the other aspects. For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website (https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.1). VHELM is intended to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new datasets and models over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress; however, these models exhibit a notable limitation, which we refer to as "face blindness". Specifically, they can engage in general conversations but fail to conduct personalized dialogues targeting at specific individuals. This deficiency hinders the application of MLLMs in personalized settings, such as tailored visual assistants on mobile devices, or domestic robots that need to recognize members of the family. In this paper, we introduce Personalized Visual Instruction Tuning (PVIT), a novel data curation and training framework designed to enable MLLMs to identify target individuals within an image and engage in personalized and coherent dialogues. Our approach involves the development of a sophisticated pipeline that autonomously generates training data containing personalized conversations. This pipeline leverages the capabilities of various visual experts, image generation models, and (multi-modal) large language models. To evaluate the personalized potential of MLLMs, we present a benchmark called P-Bench, which encompasses various question types with different levels of difficulty. The experiments demonstrate a substantial personalized performance enhancement after fine-tuning with our curated dataset.</p>

These models also appear to tolerate the use of image preprocessing techniques where existing topological data analysis techniques such as persistent homology do not. This paper investigates how methods from algebraic topology, combined with image processing techniques such as morphology, can be used to generate topologically sophisticated and diverse-looking 2-, 3-, and 4D image-type data with topological labels in simulation. These approaches are illustrated in 2D and 3D with the aim of providing a roadmap towards achieving this in 4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Douba Jafuno, Ammar Mian, Guillaume Ginolhac, Nickolas Stelzenmuller</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, a new classification model based on covariance matrices is built in order to classify buried objects. The inputs of the proposed models are the hyperbola thumbnails obtained with a classical Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system. These thumbnails are entered in the first layers of a classical CNN which results in a covariance matrix by using the outputs of the convolutional filters. Next, the covariance matrix is given to a network composed of specific layers to classify Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We show in a large database that our approach outperform shallow networks designed for GPR data and conventional CNNs typically used in computer vision applications, particularly when the number of training data decreases and in the presence of mislabeled data. We also illustrate the interest of our models when training data and test sets are obtained from different weather modes or considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Galdran</p>
<p>Abstract: This short abstract describes a solution to the COSAS 2024 competition on Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation from histopathological image patches. The main challenge in the task of segmenting this type of cancer is a noticeable domain shift encountered when changing acquisition devices (microscopes) and also when tissue comes from different organs. The two tasks proposed in COSAS were to train on a dataset of images from three different organs, and then predict segmentations on data from unseen organs (dataset T1), and to train on a dataset of images acquired on three different scanners and then segment images acquired with another unseen microscope. We attempted to bridge the domain shift gap by experimenting with three different strategies: standard training for each dataset, pretraining on dataset T1 and then fine-tuning on dataset T2 (and vice-versa, a strategy we call \textit{Cross-Task Pretraining}), and training on the combination of dataset A and B. Our experiments showed that Cross-Task Pre-training is a more promising approach to domain generalization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07128">Neural Differential Appearance Equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liu, Tobias Ritschel</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to reproduce dynamic appearance textures with space-stationary but time-varying visual statistics. While most previous work decomposes dynamic textures into static appearance and motion, we focus on dynamic appearance that results not from motion but variations of fundamental properties, such as rusting, decaying, melting, and weathering. To this end, we adopt the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to learn the underlying dynamics of appearance from a target exemplar. We simulate the ODE in two phases. At the "warm-up" phase, the ODE diffuses a random noise to an initial state. We then constrain the further evolution of this ODE to replicate the evolution of visual feature statistics in the exemplar during the generation phase. The particular innovation of this work is the neural ODE achieving both denoising and evolution for dynamics synthesis, with a proposed temporal training scheme. We study both relightable (BRDF) and non-relightable (RGB) appearance models. For both we introduce new pilot datasets, allowing, for the first time, to study such phenomena: For RGB we provide 22 dynamic textures acquired from free online sources; For BRDFs, we further acquire a dataset of 21 flash-lit videos of time-varying materials, enabled by a simple-to-construct setup. Our experiments show that our method consistently yields realistic and coherent results, whereas prior works falter under pronounced temporal appearance variations. A user study confirms our approach is preferred to previous work for such exemplars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhao, Hangjie Yuan, Yujie Wei, Shiwei Zhang, Yuchao Gu, Lingmin Ran, Xiang Wang, Zhangjie Wu, Junhao Zhang, Yingya Zhang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generation models have showcased remarkable capabilities in generating fantastic content. However, most of them are trained on proprietary high-quality data, and some models withhold their parameters and only provide accessible application programming interfaces (APIs), limiting their benefits for downstream tasks. To explore the feasibility of training a text-to-image generation model comparable to advanced models using publicly available resources, we introduce EvolveDirector. This framework interacts with advanced models through their public APIs to obtain text-image data pairs to train a base model. Our experiments with extensive data indicate that the model trained on generated data of the advanced model can approximate its generation capability. However, it requires large-scale samples of 10 million or more. This incurs significant expenses in time, computational resources, and especially the costs associated with calling fee-based APIs. To address this problem, we leverage pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) to guide the evolution of the base model. VLM continuously evaluates the base model during training and dynamically updates and refines the training dataset by the discrimination, expansion, deletion, and mutation operations. Experimental results show that this paradigm significantly reduces the required data volume. Furthermore, when approaching multiple advanced models, EvolveDirector can select the best samples generated by them to learn powerful and balanced abilities. The final trained model Edgen is demonstrated to outperform these advanced models. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/showlab/EvolveDirector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clement Neo, Luke Ong, Philip Torr, Mor Geva, David Krueger, Fazl Barez</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding text and images. We study the processing of visual tokens in the language model component of LLaVA, a prominent VLM. Our approach focuses on analyzing the localization of object information, the evolution of visual token representations across layers, and the mechanism of integrating visual information for predictions. Through ablation studies, we demonstrated that object identification accuracy drops by over 70\% when object-specific tokens are removed. We observed that visual token representations become increasingly interpretable in the vocabulary space across layers, suggesting an alignment with textual tokens corresponding to image content. Finally, we found that the model extracts object information from these refined representations at the last token position for prediction, mirroring the process in text-only language models for factual association tasks. These findings provide crucial insights into how VLMs process and integrate visual information, bridging the gap between our understanding of language and vision models, and paving the way for more interpretable and controllable multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donglin Di, He Feng, Wenzhang Sun, Yongjia Ma, Hao Li, Wei Chen, Xiaofei Gou, Tonghua Su, Xun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating talking face videos from various conditions has recently become a highly popular research area within generative tasks. However, building a high-quality face video generation model requires a well-performing pre-trained backbone, a key obstacle that universal models fail to adequately address. Most existing works rely on universal video or image generation models and optimize control mechanisms, but they neglect the evident upper bound in video quality due to the limited capabilities of the backbones, which is a result of the lack of high-quality human face video datasets. In this work, we investigate the unsatisfactory results from related studies, gather and trim existing public talking face video datasets, and additionally collect and annotate a large-scale dataset, resulting in a comprehensive, high-quality multiracial face collection named \textbf{FaceVid-1K}. Using this dataset, we craft several effective pre-trained backbone models for face video generation. Specifically, we conduct experiments with several well-established video generation models, including text-to-video, image-to-video, and unconditional video generation, under various settings. We obtain the corresponding performance benchmarks and compared them with those trained on public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our dataset. These experiments also allow us to investigate empirical strategies for crafting domain-specific video generation tasks with cost-effective settings. We will make our curated dataset, along with the pre-trained talking face video generation models, publicly available as a resource contribution to hopefully advance the research field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Wen, Mengyuan Liu, Songtao Wu, Beichen Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based multi-entity action recognition is a challenging task aiming to identify interactive actions or group activities involving multiple diverse entities. Existing models for individuals often fall short in this task due to the inherent distribution discrepancies among entity skeletons, leading to suboptimal backbone optimization. To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull Adaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which mitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and unbiases subsequent backbones. Specifically, CHASE comprises a learnable parameterized network and an auxiliary objective. The parameterized network achieves plausible, sample-adaptive repositioning of skeleton sequences through two key components. First, the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift ensures that the new origin of the coordinate system is within the skeleton convex hull. Second, the Coefficient Learning Block provides a lightweight parameterization of the mapping from skeleton sequences to their specific coefficients in convex combinations. Moreover, to guide the optimization of this network for discrepancy minimization, we propose the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the additional objective. CHASE operates as a sample-adaptive normalization method to mitigate inter-entity distribution discrepancies, thereby reducing data bias and improving the subsequent classifier's multi-entity action recognition performance. Extensive experiments on six datasets, including NTU Mutual 11/26, H2O, Assembly101, Collective Activity and Volleyball, consistently verify our approach by seamlessly adapting to single-entity backbones and boosting their performance in multi-entity scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video generation, further improving the effectiveness of 4D synthesis. Existing 4D generation methods can generate high-quality 4D objects or scenes based on user-friendly conditions, benefiting the gaming and video industries. However, these methods struggle to synthesize significant object deformation of complex 4D transitions and interactions within scenes. To address this challenge, we propose Trans4D, a novel text-to-4D synthesis framework that enables realistic complex scene transitions. Specifically, we first use multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce a physic-aware scene description for 4D scene initialization and effective transition timing planning. Then we propose a geometry-aware 4D transition network to realize a complex scene-level 4D transition based on the plan, which involves expressive geometrical object deformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Trans4D consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in generating 4D scenes with accurate and high-quality transitions, validating its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luchuan Song, Lele Chen, Celong Liu, Pinxin Liu, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose TextToon, a method to generate a drivable toonified avatar. Given a short monocular video sequence and a written instruction about the avatar style, our model can generate a high-fidelity toonified avatar that can be driven in real-time by another video with arbitrary identities. Existing related works heavily rely on multi-view modeling to recover geometry via texture embeddings, presented in a static manner, leading to control limitations. The multi-view video input also makes it difficult to deploy these models in real-world applications. To address these issues, we adopt a conditional embedding Tri-plane to learn realistic and stylized facial representations in a Gaussian deformation field. Additionally, we expand the stylization capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing an adaptive pixel-translation neural network and leveraging patch-aware contrastive learning to achieve high-quality images. To push our work into consumer applications, we develop a real-time system that can operate at 48 FPS on a GPU machine and 15-18 FPS on a mobile machine. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating textual avatars over existing methods in terms of quality and real-time animation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07164">AvatarGO: Zero-shot 4D Human-Object Interaction Generation and Animation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukang Cao, Liang Pan, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have led to significant improvements in the generation and animation of 4D full-body human-object interactions (HOI). Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on SMPL-based motion generation, which is limited by the scarcity of realistic large-scale interaction data. This constraint affects their ability to create everyday HOI scenes. This paper addresses this challenge using a zero-shot approach with a pre-trained diffusion model. Despite this potential, achieving our goals is difficult due to the diffusion model's lack of understanding of ''where'' and ''how'' objects interact with the human body. To tackle these issues, we introduce AvatarGO, a novel framework designed to generate animatable 4D HOI scenes directly from textual inputs. Specifically, 1) for the ''where'' challenge, we propose LLM-guided contact retargeting, which employs Lang-SAM to identify the contact body part from text prompts, ensuring precise representation of human-object spatial relations. 2) For the ''how'' challenge, we introduce correspondence-aware motion optimization that constructs motion fields for both human and object models using the linear blend skinning function from SMPL-X. Our framework not only generates coherent compositional motions, but also exhibits greater robustness in handling penetration issues. Extensive experiments with existing methods validate AvatarGO's superior generation and animation capabilities on a variety of human-object pairs and diverse poses. As the first attempt to synthesize 4D avatars with object interactions, we hope AvatarGO could open new doors for human-centric 4D content creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qidong Huang, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Dahua Lin, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Modality Integration Rate (MIR), an effective, robust, and generalized metric to indicate the multi-modal pre-training quality of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Large-scale pre-training plays a critical role in building capable LVLMs, while evaluating its training quality without the costly supervised fine-tuning stage is under-explored. Loss, perplexity, and in-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less indicative when aligning a well-trained LLM with a new modality. Due to the lack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the critical pre-training stage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module design, etc. In this paper, we propose evaluating the pre-training quality from the inter-modal distribution distance perspective and present MIR, the Modality Integration Rate, which is 1) \textbf{Effective} to represent the pre-training quality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after supervised fine-tuning. 2) \textbf{Robust} toward different training/evaluation data. 3) \textbf{Generalize} across training configurations and architecture choices. We conduct a series of pre-training experiments to explore the effectiveness of MIR and observe satisfactory results that MIR is indicative about training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model architecture design to get better pre-training results. We hope MIR could be a helpful metric for building capable LVLMs and inspire the following research about modality alignment in different areas.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinchen Zhang, Ling Yang, Guohao Li, Yaqi Cai, Jiake Xie, Yong Tang, Yujiu Yang, Mengdi Wang, Bin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced diffusion models like RPG, Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX have made notable strides in compositional text-to-image generation. However, these methods typically exhibit distinct strengths for compositional generation, with some excelling in handling attribute binding and others in spatial relationships. This disparity highlights the need for an approach that can leverage the complementary strengths of various models to comprehensively improve the composition capability. To this end, we introduce IterComp, a novel framework that aggregates composition-aware model preferences from multiple models and employs an iterative feedback learning approach to enhance compositional generation. Specifically, we curate a gallery of six powerful open-source diffusion models and evaluate their three key compositional metrics: attribute binding, spatial relationships, and non-spatial relationships. Based on these metrics, we develop a composition-aware model preference dataset comprising numerous image-rank pairs to train composition-aware reward models. Then, we propose an iterative feedback learning method to enhance compositionality in a closed-loop manner, enabling the progressive self-refinement of both the base diffusion model and reward models over multiple iterations. Theoretical proof demonstrates the effectiveness and extensive experiments show our significant superiority over previous SOTA methods (e.g., Omost and FLUX), particularly in multi-category object composition and complex semantic alignment. IterComp opens new research avenues in reward feedback learning for diffusion models and compositional generation. Code: https://github.com/YangLing0818/IterComp</p>

<p>Abstract: This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding. To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we develop a data engine that efficiently generates 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long, based on human-annotated data. This is currently the largest egocentric QA dataset. Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated. Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel "Memory Pointer Prompting" mechanism. This design includes a global glimpse step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content. With the data, benchmark, and model, we successfully build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Taimur Ahad, Israt Jahan Payel, Bo Song, Yan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Blood cancer can only be diagnosed properly if it is detected early. Each year, more than 1.24 million new cases of blood cancer are reported worldwide. There are about 6,000 cancers worldwide due to this disease. The importance of cancer detection and classification has prompted researchers to evaluate Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for the purpose of classifying blood cancers. The objective of this research is to conduct an in-depth investigation of the efficacy and suitability of modern Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for the detection and classification of blood malignancies. The study focuses on investigating the potential of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs), comprising not only the foundational CNN models but also those improved through transfer learning methods and incorporated into ensemble strategies, to detect diverse forms of blood cancer with a high degree of accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive investigation into five deep learning architectures derived from CNNs. These models, namely VGG19, ResNet152v2, SEresNet152, ResNet101, and DenseNet201, integrate ensemble learning techniques with transfer learning strategies. A comparison of DenseNet201 (98.08%), VGG19 (96.94%), and SEresNet152 (90.93%) shows that DVS outperforms CNN. With transfer learning, DenseNet201 had 95.00% accuracy, VGG19 had 72.29%, and SEresNet152 had 94.16%. In the study, the ensemble DVS model achieved 98.76% accuracy. Based on our study, the ensemble DVS model is the best for detecting and classifying blood cancers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching-Chun Chang, Kai Gao, Shuying Xu, Anastasia Kordoni, Christopher Leckie, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural backdoors represent insidious cybersecurity loopholes that render learning machinery vulnerable to unauthorised manipulations, potentially enabling the weaponisation of artificial intelligence with catastrophic consequences. A backdoor attack involves the clandestine infiltration of a trigger during the learning process, metaphorically analogous to hypnopaedia, where ideas are implanted into a subject's subconscious mind under the state of hypnosis or unconsciousness. When activated by a sensory stimulus, the trigger evokes conditioned reflex that directs a machine to mount a predetermined response. In this study, we propose a cybernetic framework for constant surveillance of backdoors threats, driven by the dynamic nature of untrustworthy data sources. We develop a self-aware unlearning mechanism to autonomously detach a machine's behaviour from the backdoor trigger. Through reverse engineering and statistical inference, we detect deceptive patterns and estimate the likelihood of backdoor infection. We employ model inversion to elicit artificial mental imagery, using stochastic processes to disrupt optimisation pathways and avoid convergent but potentially flawed patterns. This is followed by hypothesis analysis, which estimates the likelihood of each potentially malicious pattern being the true trigger and infers the probability of infection. The primary objective of this study is to maintain a stable state of equilibrium between knowledge fidelity and backdoor vulnerability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised audiovisual speech enhancement (AVSE) approach that combines a diffusion-based audio-visual speech generative model with a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) noise model. First, the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution. This pre-trained model is then paired with the NMF-based noise model to iteratively estimate clean speech. Specifically, a diffusion-based posterior sampling approach is implemented within the reverse diffusion process, where after each iteration, a speech estimate is obtained and used to update the noise parameters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed AVSE approach not only outperforms its audio-only counterpart but also generalizes better than a recent supervisedgenerative AVSE method. Additionally, the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Gao, Yuanyuan Yang, Jianrui Wei, Xuntao Yin, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: The insufficient supervision limit the performance of the deep supervised models for brain disease diagnosis. It is important to develop a learning framework that can capture more information in limited data and insufficient supervision. To address these issues at some extend, we propose a multi-stage graph learning framework which incorporates 1) pretrain stage : self-supervised graph learning on insufficient supervision of the fmri data 2) fine-tune stage : supervised graph learning for brain disorder diagnosis. Experiment results on three datasets, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE I, ABIDE II and ADHD with AAL1,demonstrating the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework compared to the state of art of models.(ranging from 0.7330 to 0.9321,0.7209 to 0.9021,0.6338 to 0.6699)</p>

<p>Abstract: Classifiers trained with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tend to rely on attributes that have high spurious correlation with the target. This can degrade the performance on underrepresented (or 'minority') groups that lack these attributes, posing significant challenges for both out-of-distribution generalization and fairness objectives. Many studies aim to enhance robustness to spurious correlation, but they sometimes depend on group annotations for training. Additionally, a common limitation in previous research is the reliance on group-annotated validation datasets for model selection. This constrains their applicability in situations where the nature of the spurious correlation is not known, or when group labels for certain spurious attributes are not available. To enhance model robustness with minimal group annotation assumptions, we propose Environment-based Validation and Loss-based Sampling (EVaLS). It uses the losses from an ERM-trained model to construct a balanced dataset of high-loss and low-loss samples, mitigating group imbalance in data. This significantly enhances robustness to group shifts when equipped with a simple post-training last layer retraining. By using environment inference methods to create diverse environments with correlation shifts, EVaLS can potentially eliminate the need for group annotation in validation data. In this context, the worst environment accuracy acts as a reliable surrogate throughout the retraining process for tuning hyperparameters and finding a model that performs well across diverse group shifts. EVaLS effectively achieves group robustness, showing that group annotation is not necessary even for validation. It is a fast, straightforward, and effective approach that reaches near-optimal worst group accuracy without needing group annotations, marking a new chapter in the robustness of trained models against spurious correlation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksey Valouev, Rachel Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering is vital for precisely controlling the focus of light in computational imaging, with applications in neural imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and biophotonics. The PSF is derived from the magnitude of the Fourier transform of a phase function, making the construction of the phase function given the PSF (PSF engineering) an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional PSF engineering methods rely on physical basis functions, limiting their ability to generalize across the range of PSFs required for imaging tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging implicit neural representations that significantly outperforms existing pixel-wise optimization methods in phase function quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Liu, Yiren Song, Hai Ci, Yu Zhang, Haofan Wang, Mike Zheng Shou, Yuheng Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image watermark techniques provide an effective way to assert ownership, deter misuse, and trace content sources, which has become increasingly essential in the era of large generative models. A critical attribute of watermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this paper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively nullifying the state of the art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight involves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian noise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and spatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and the spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising process towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the cleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off between watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose an adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying numbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image, followed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent representation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent representation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the desired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various watermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer superior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance compared to existing regeneration approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Song, Thomas Anderson Keller, Yisong Yue, Pietro Perona, Max Welling</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a vast literature on representation learning based on principles such as coding efficiency, statistical independence, causality, controllability, or symmetry. In this paper we propose to learn representations from sequence data by factorizing the transformations of the latent variables into sparse components. Input data are first encoded as distributions of latent activations and subsequently transformed using a probability flow model, before being decoded to predict a future input state. The flow model is decomposed into a number of rotational (divergence-free) vector fields and a number of potential flow (curl-free) fields. Our sparsity prior encourages only a small number of these fields to be active at any instant and infers the speed with which the probability flows along these fields. Training this model is completely unsupervised using a standard variational objective and results in a new form of disentangled representations where the input is not only represented by a combination of independent factors, but also by a combination of independent transformation primitives given by the learned flow fields. When viewing the transformations as symmetries one may interpret this as learning approximately equivariant representations. Empirically we demonstrate that this model achieves state of the art in terms of both data likelihood and unsupervised approximate equivariance errors on datasets composed of sequence transformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyao Yu, Yixiang Qiu, Hao Fang, Bin Chen, Sijin Yu, Bin Wang, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) aim at recovering privacy-sensitive training data from the knowledge encoded in the released machine learning models. Recent advances in the MIA field have significantly enhanced the attack performance under multiple scenarios, posing serious privacy risks of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the development of defense strategies against MIAs is relatively backward to resist the latest MIAs and existing defenses fail to achieve further trade-off between model utility and model robustness. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of intrinsic vulnerabilities of MIAs, comprehensively uncovering the weaknesses inherent in the basic pipeline, which are partially investigated in the previous defenses. Building upon these new insights, we propose a robust defense mechanism, integrating Confidence Adaptation and Low-Rank compression(CALoR). Our method includes a novel robustness-enhanced classification loss specially-designed for model inversion defenses and reveals the extraordinary effectiveness of compressing the classification header. With CALoR, we can mislead the optimization objective, reduce the leaked information and impede the backpropagation of MIAs, thus mitigating the risk of privacy leakage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense performance against MIAs and exhibits superior generalization to existing defenses across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michel Pohl, Mitsuru Uesaka, Hiroyuki Takahashi, Kazuyuki Demachi, Ritu Bhusal Chhatkuli</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung radiotherapy treatment systems are subject to a latency that leads to uncertainty in the estimated tumor location and high irradiation of healthy tissue. This work addresses future frame prediction in chest dynamic MRI sequences to compensate for that delay using RNNs trained with online learning algorithms. The latter enable networks to mitigate irregular movements, as they update synaptic weights with each new training example. Experiments were conducted using four publicly available 2D thoracic cine-MRI sequences. PCA decomposes the time-varying deformation vector field (DVF), computed with the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, into static deformation fields and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various algorithms to forecast the latter: linear regression, least mean squares (LMS), and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces and sparse 1-step approximation (SnAp-1). That enables estimating the future DVFs and, in turn, the next frames by warping the initial image. Linear regression led to the lowest mean DVF error at a horizon h = 0.32s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made), equal to 1.30mm, followed by SnAp-1 and RTRL, whose error increased from 1.37mm to 1.44mm as h increased from 0.62s to 2.20s. Similarly, the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of LMS decreased from 0.904 to 0.898 as h increased from 0.31s to 1.57s and was the highest among the algorithms compared for the latter horizons. SnAp-1 attained the highest SSIM for h $\geq$ 1.88s, with values of less than 0.898. The predicted images look similar to the original ones, and the highest errors occurred at challenging areas such as the diaphragm boundary at the end-of-inhale phase, where motion variability is more prominent, and regions where out-of-plane motion was more prevalent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Malard, Michel Olvera, St\'ephane Lathuiliere, Slim Essid</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models have fueled progress in image captioning. These models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding of semantic concepts. In this work, we show that this ability can be re-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be leveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within videos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal alignment. Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. Moreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive learning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders smooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image captioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the image tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an unsupervised fashion while keeping the initial image captioning component unaltered. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Streli, Jiaxi Jiang, Andreas Fender, Manuel Meier, Hugo Romat, Christian Holz</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the advent of touchscreens, typing on physical keyboards remains most efficient for entering text, because users can leverage all fingers across a full-size keyboard for convenient typing. As users increasingly type on the go, text input on mobile and wearable devices has had to compromise on full-size typing. In this paper, we present TapType, a mobile text entry system for full-size typing on passive surfaces--without an actual keyboard. From the inertial sensors inside a band on either wrist, TapType decodes and relates surface taps to a traditional QWERTY keyboard layout. The key novelty of our method is to predict the most likely character sequences by fusing the finger probabilities from our Bayesian neural network classifier with the characters' prior probabilities from an n-gram language model. In our online evaluation, participants on average typed 19 words per minute with a character error rate of 0.6% after 30 minutes of training. Expert typists thereby consistently achieved more than 25 WPM at a similar error rate. We demonstrate applications of TapType in mobile use around smartphones and tablets, as a complement to interaction in situated Mixed Reality outside visual control, and as an eyes-free mobile text input method using an audio feedback-only interface.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Liu, Tianyi Zhang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Weiming Zhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent developments for robots to represent environments have focused on photorealistic reconstructions. This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saqib Javed, Hieu Le, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that perform well not only on the training (source) domains but also on novel, unseen target data distributions. A key challenge in DG is preventing overfitting to source domains, which can be mitigated by finding flatter minima in the loss landscape. In this work, we propose Quantization-aware Training for Domain Generalization (QT-DoG) and demonstrate that weight quantization effectively leads to flatter minima in the loss landscape, thereby enhancing domain generalization. Unlike traditional quantization methods focused on model compression, QT-DoG exploits quantization as an implicit regularizer by inducing noise in model weights, guiding the optimization process toward flatter minima that are less sensitive to perturbations and overfitting. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence demonstrating that quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better generalization across domains. Moreover, with the benefit of reducing the model size through quantization, we demonstrate that an ensemble of multiple quantized models further yields superior accuracy than the state-of-the-art DG approaches with no computational or memory overheads. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that QT-DoG generalizes across various datasets, architectures, and quantization algorithms, and can be combined with other DG methods, establishing its versatility and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Precision pose detection is increasingly demanded in fields such as personal fabrication, Virtual Reality (VR), and robotics due to its critical role in ensuring accurate positioning information. However, conventional vision-based systems used in these systems often struggle with achieving high precision and accuracy, particularly when dealing with complex environments or fast-moving objects. To address these limitations, we investigate Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI), an emerging optical tracking method that offers promising potential for improving pose estimation accuracy. Specifically, our proposed LSI-Based Tracking (SpecTrack) leverages the captures from a lensless camera and a retro-reflector marker with a coded aperture to achieve multi-axis rotational pose estimation with high precision. Our extensive trials using our in-house built testbed have shown that SpecTrack achieves an accuracy of 0.31{\deg} (std=0.43{\deg}), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches and improving accuracy up to 200%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barak Gahtan, Robert J. Shahla, Reuven Cohen, Alex M. Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: QUIC, a new and increasingly used transport protocol, enhances TCP by providing better security, performance, and features like stream multiplexing. These features, however, also impose challenges for network middle-boxes that need to monitor and analyze web traffic. This paper proposes a novel solution for estimating the number of HTTP/3 responses in a given QUIC connection by an observer. This estimation reveals server behavior, client-server interactions, and data transmission efficiency, which is crucial for various applications such as designing a load balancing solution and detecting HTTP/3 flood attacks. The proposed scheme transforms QUIC connection traces into a sequence of images and trains machine learning (ML) models to predict the number of responses. Then, by aggregating images of a QUIC connection, an observer can estimate the total number of responses. As the problem is formulated as a discrete regression problem, we introduce a dedicated loss function. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a dataset of over seven million images, generated from $100,000$ traces collected from over $44,000$ websites over a four-month period, from various vantage points. The scheme achieves up to 97\% cumulative accuracy in both known and unknown web server settings and 92\% accuracy in estimating the total number of responses in unseen QUIC traces.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the structural growth of paediatric brains is a key step in the identification of various neuro-developmental disorders. However, our knowledge is limited by many factors, including the lack of automated image analysis tools, especially in Low and Middle Income Countries from the lack of high field MR images available. Low-field systems are being increasingly explored in these countries, and, therefore, there is a need to develop automated image analysis tools for these images. In this work, as a preliminary step, we consider two tasks: 1) automated quality assurance and 2) hippocampal segmentation, where we compare multiple approaches. For the automated quality assurance task a DenseNet combined with appearance-based transformations for synthesising artefacts produced the best performance, with a weighted accuracy of 82.3%. For the segmentation task, registration of an average atlas performed the best, with a final Dice score of 0.61. Our results show that although the images can provide understanding of large scale pathologies and gross scale anatomical development, there still remain barriers for their use for more granular analyses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

<p>Abstract: Current evaluation practices in speech-driven gesture generation lack standardisation and focus on aspects that are easy to measure over aspects that actually matter. This leads to a situation where it is impossible to know what is the state of the art, or to know which method works better for which purpose when comparing two publications. In this position paper, we review and give details on issues with existing gesture-generation evaluation, and present a novel proposal for remedying them. Specifically, we announce an upcoming living leaderboard to benchmark progress in conversational motion synthesis. Unlike earlier gesture-generation challenges, the leaderboard will be updated with large-scale user studies of new gesture-generation systems multiple times per year, and systems on the leaderboard can be submitted to any publication venue that their authors prefer. By evolving the leaderboard evaluation data and tasks over time, the effort can keep driving progress towards the most important end goals identified by the community. We actively seek community involvement across the entire evaluation pipeline: from data and tasks for the evaluation, via tooling, to the systems evaluated. In other words, our proposal will not only make it easier for researchers to perform good evaluations, but their collective input and contributions will also help drive the future of gesture-generation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Pope, Md Hassanuzzaman, Mingmar Sherpa, Omar Emara, Ayush Joshi, Nirmala Adhikari</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Many open-source skin cancer image datasets are the result of clinical trials conducted in countries with lighter skin tones. Due to this tone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform well at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these models could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the artificial intelligence health field.
  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a significant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias. To address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional neural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then evaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to dark or light skin tone.
  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in a disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the model is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter versus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or balanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well below the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with respect to skin tone.
  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models can be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone imbalance is not the cause of the bias. Other techniques will be necessary to identify and address the bias in these models, an area of future investigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Klammer, Michael Kaess</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground to aerial matching is a crucial and challenging task in outdoor robotics, particularly when GPS is absent or unreliable. Structures like buildings or large dense forests create interference, requiring GNSS replacements for global positioning estimates. The true difficulty lies in reconciling the perspective difference between the ground and air images for acceptable localization. Taking inspiration from the autonomous driving community, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing a birds-eye-view (BEV) scene representation to match and localize against an aerial map in off-road environments. We leverage contrastive learning with domain specific hard negative mining to train a network to learn similar representations between the synthesized BEV and the aerial map. During inference, BEVLoc guides the identification of the most probable locations within the aerial map through a coarse-to-fine matching strategy. Our results demonstrate promising initial outcomes in extremely difficult forest environments with limited semantic diversity. We analyze our model's performance for coarse and fine matching, assessing both the raw matching capability of our model and its performance as a GNSS replacement. Our work delves into off-road map localization while establishing a foundational baseline for future developments in localization. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rpl-cmu/bevloc</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourjyadip Ray, Kushal Gupta, Soumi Kundu, Payal Arvind Kasat, Somak Aditya, Pawan Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: The global shortage of healthcare workers has demanded the development of smart healthcare assistants, which can help monitor and alert healthcare workers when necessary. We examine the healthcare knowledge of existing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) via the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task in hospital settings through expert annotated open-ended questions. We introduce the Emergency Room Visual Question Answering (ERVQA) dataset, consisting of <image, question, answer> triplets covering diverse emergency room scenarios, a seminal benchmark for LVLMs. By developing a detailed error taxonomy and analyzing answer trends, we reveal the nuanced nature of the task. We benchmark state-of-the-art open-source and closed LVLMs using traditional and adapted VQA metrics: Entailment Score and CLIPScore Confidence. Analyzing errors across models, we infer trends based on properties like decoder type, model size, and in-context examples. Our findings suggest the ERVQA dataset presents a highly complex task, highlighting the need for specialized, domain-specific solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Fifty, Ronald G. Junkins, Dennis Duan, Aniketh Iger, Jerry W. Liu, Ehsan Amid, Sebastian Thrun, Christopher R\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) are designed to compress a continuous input to a discrete latent space and reconstruct it with minimal distortion. They operate by maintaining a set of vectors -- often referred to as the codebook -- and quantizing each encoder output to the nearest vector in the codebook. However, as vector quantization is non-differentiable, the gradient to the encoder flows around the vector quantization layer rather than through it in a straight-through approximation. This approximation may be undesirable as all information from the vector quantization operation is lost. In this work, we propose a way to propagate gradients through the vector quantization layer of VQ-VAEs. We smoothly transform each encoder output into its corresponding codebook vector via a rotation and rescaling linear transformation that is treated as a constant during backpropagation. As a result, the relative magnitude and angle between encoder output and codebook vector becomes encoded into the gradient as it propagates through the vector quantization layer and back to the encoder. Across 11 different VQ-VAE training paradigms, we find this restructuring improves reconstruction metrics, codebook utilization, and quantization error.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kojiro Takeyama, Yimeng Liu, Misha Sra</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human locomotion is crucial for AI agents such as robots, particularly in complex indoor home environments. Modeling human trajectories in these spaces requires insight into how individuals maneuver around physical obstacles and manage social navigation dynamics. These dynamics include subtle behaviors influenced by proxemics - the social use of space, such as stepping aside to allow others to pass or choosing longer routes to avoid collisions. Previous research has developed datasets of human motion in indoor scenes, but these are often limited in scale and lack the nuanced social navigation dynamics common in home environments. To address this, we present LocoVR, a dataset of 7000+ two-person trajectories captured in virtual reality from over 130 different indoor home environments. LocoVR provides full body pose data and precise spatial information, along with rich examples of socially-motivated movement behaviors. For example, the dataset captures instances of individuals navigating around each other in narrow spaces, adjusting paths to respect personal boundaries in living areas, and coordinating movements in high-traffic zones like entryways and kitchens. Our evaluation shows that LocoVR significantly enhances model performance in three practical indoor tasks utilizing human trajectories, and demonstrates predicting socially-aware navigation patterns in home environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Chen, Qian Chen, Jian Lou, Xiaoyu Zhang, Kai Wu, Zilong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is becoming a promising paradigm to achieve the "right to be forgotten", where the training trace of any chosen data points could be eliminated, while maintaining the model utility on general testing samples after unlearning. With the advancement of forgetting research, many fundamental open questions remain unanswered: do different samples exhibit varying levels of difficulty in being forgotten? Further, does the sequence in which samples are forgotten, determined by their respective difficulty levels, influence the performance of forgetting algorithms? In this paper, we identify key factor affecting unlearning difficulty and the performance of unlearning algorithms. We find that samples with higher privacy risks are more likely to be unlearning, indicating that the unlearning difficulty varies among different samples which motives a more precise unlearning mode. Built upon this insight, we propose a general unlearning framework, dubbed RSU, which consists of Ranking module and SeqUnlearn module.</p>

It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06478">MaskBlur: Spatial and Angular Data Augmentation for Light Field Image Super-Resolution</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Chao, Fuqing Duan, Yulan Guo, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is an effective approach for enhancing model performance with limited data, such as light field (LF) image super-resolution (SR). LF images inherently possess rich spatial and angular information. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of DA methodologies explicitly tailored for LF images, and existing works tend to concentrate solely on either the spatial or angular domain. This paper proposes a novel spatial and angular DA strategy named MaskBlur for LF image SR by concurrently addressing spatial and angular aspects. MaskBlur consists of spatial blur and angular dropout two components. Spatial blur is governed by a spatial mask, which controls where pixels are blurred, i.e., pasting pixels between the low-resolution and high-resolution domains. The angular mask is responsible for angular dropout, i.e., selecting which views to perform the spatial blur operation. By doing so, MaskBlur enables the model to treat pixels differently in the spatial and angular domains when super-resolving LF images rather than blindly treating all pixels equally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of MaskBlur in significantly enhancing the performance of existing SR methods. We further extend MaskBlur to other LF image tasks such as denoising, deblurring, low-light enhancement, and real-world SR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyao Qin, Arun J. Thirunavukarasu, Le Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of diabetes, characterized by thickening of the central portion of the retina due to accumulation of fluid. DME is a significant and common cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients. Center-involved DME (ci-DME) is the highest risk form of disease as fluid extends close to the fovea which is responsible for sharp central vision. Earlier diagnosis or prediction of ci-DME may improve treatment outcomes. Here, we propose an ensemble method to predict ci-DME onset within a year using ultra-wide-field color fundus photography (UWF-CFP) images provided by the DIAMOND Challenge. We adopted a variety of baseline state-of-the-art classification networks including ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and VGG with the aim of enhancing model robustness. The best performing models were Densenet 121, Resnet 152 and EfficientNet b7, and these were assembled into a definitive predictive model. The final ensemble model demonstrates a strong performance with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.7017, an F1 score of 0.6512, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.2057 when deployed on a synthetic dataset. The performance of this ensemble model is comparable to previous studies despite training and testing in a more realistic setting, indicating the potential of UWF-CFP combined with a deep learning classification system to facilitate earlier diagnosis, better treatment decisions, and improved prognostication in ci-DME.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present MedImageInsight, an open-source medical imaging embedding model. MedImageInsight is trained on medical images with associated text and labels across a diverse collection of domains, including X-Ray, CT, MRI, dermoscopy, OCT, fundus photography, ultrasound, histopathology, and mammography. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate MedImageInsight's ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) or human expert level performance across classification, image-image search, and fine-tuning tasks. Specifically, on public datasets, MedImageInsight achieves SOTA in CT 3D medical image retrieval, as well as SOTA in disease classification and search for chest X-ray, dermatology, and OCT imaging. Furthermore, MedImageInsight achieves human expert performance in bone age estimation (on both public and partner data), as well as AUC above 0.9 in most other domains. When paired with a text decoder, MedImageInsight achieves near SOTA level single image report findings generation with less than 10\% the parameters of other models. Compared to fine-tuning GPT-4o with only MIMIC-CXR data for the same task, MedImageInsight outperforms in clinical metrics, but underperforms on lexical metrics where GPT-4o sets a new SOTA. Importantly for regulatory purposes, MedImageInsight can generate ROC curves, adjust sensitivity and specificity based on clinical need, and provide evidence-based decision support through image-image search (which can also enable retrieval augmented generation). In an independent clinical evaluation of image-image search in chest X-ray, MedImageInsight outperformed every other publicly available foundation model evaluated by large margins (over 6 points AUC), and significantly outperformed other models in terms of AI fairness (across age and gender). We hope releasing MedImageInsight will help enhance collective progress in medical imaging AI research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Hausler, Peyman Moghadam</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we propose a novel joint training method for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which simultaneously learns a global descriptor and a pair classifier for re-ranking. The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

<p>Abstract: We propose M^3Bench, a new benchmark for whole-body motion generation for mobile manipulation tasks. Given a 3D scene context, M^3Bench requires an embodied agent to understand its configuration, environmental constraints and task objectives, then generate coordinated whole-body motion trajectories for object rearrangement tasks. M^3Bench features 30k object rearrangement tasks across 119 diverse scenes, providing expert demonstrations generated by our newly developed M^3BenchMaker. This automatic data generation tool produces coordinated whole-body motion trajectories from high-level task instructions, requiring only basic scene and robot information. Our benchmark incorporates various task splits to assess generalization across different dimensions and leverages realistic physics simulation for trajectory evaluation. Through extensive experimental analyses, we reveal that state-of-the-art models still struggle with coordinated base-arm motion while adhering to environment-context and task-specific constraints, highlighting the need to develop new models that address this gap. Through M^3Bench, we aim to facilitate future robotics research towards more adaptive and capable mobile manipulation in diverse, real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba2 are a promising alternative to Transformers, with faster theoretical training and inference times -- especially for long context lengths. Recent work on Matryoshka Representation Learning -- and its application to Transformer backbones in works like MatFormer -- showed how to introduce nested granularities of smaller submodels in one universal elastic model. In this work, we present MatMamba: a state space model which combines Matryoshka-style learning with Mamba2, by modifying the block to contain nested dimensions to enable joint training and adaptive inference. MatMamba allows for efficient and adaptive deployment across various model sizes. We train a single large MatMamba model and are able to get a number of smaller nested models for free -- while maintaining or improving upon the performance of a baseline smaller model trained from scratch. We train language and image models at a variety of parameter sizes from 35M to 1.4B. Our results on ImageNet and FineWeb show that MatMamba models scale comparably to Transformers, while having more efficient inference characteristics. This makes MatMamba a practically viable option for deploying large-scale models in an elastic way based on the available inference compute.

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have recently become a popular research direction within computational pathology. They are intended to be general-purpose feature extractors, promising to achieve good performance on a range of downstream tasks. Real-world pathology image data does however exhibit considerable variability. Foundation models should be robust to these variations and other distribution shifts which might be encountered in practice. We evaluate two computational pathology foundation models: UNI (trained on more than 100,000 whole-slide images) and CONCH (trained on more than 1.1 million image-caption pairs), by utilizing them as feature extractors within prostate cancer grading models. We find that while UNI and CONCH perform well relative to baselines, the absolute performance can still be far from satisfactory in certain settings. The fact that foundation models have been trained on large and varied datasets does not guarantee that downstream models always will be robust to common distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Chen, Bowen Zhang, Gang Wang, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: While advancements in NLP have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring vertical thinking, their lateral thinking capabilities remain under-explored and challenging to measure due to the complexity of assessing creative thought processes and the scarcity of relevant data. To address these challenges, we introduce SPLAT, a benchmark leveraging Situation Puzzles to evaluate and elicit LAteral Thinking of LLMs. This benchmark, containing 975 graded situation puzzles across three difficulty levels, employs a new multi-turn player-judge framework instead of the traditional model-based evaluation, which often necessitates a stronger evaluation model. This framework simulates an interactive game where the model (player) asks the evaluation model (judge) questions about an incomplete story to infer the full scenario. The judge answers based on a detailed reference scenario or evaluates if the player's predictions align with the reference one. This approach lessens dependence on more robust evaluation models, enabling the assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs. The experiments demonstrate that a robust evaluation model, such as WizardLM-2, closely matches human judgements in both intermediate question-answering and final scenario accuracy, achieving over 80% agreement-similar to the agreement levels among humans. Furthermore, applying data and reasoning processes from our benchmark to other lateral thinking-related benchmarks, e.g., RiddleSense and BrainTeaser, leads to performance enhancements. This suggests that our benchmark effectively evaluates and elicits the lateral thinking abilities of LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/chenqi008/LateralThinking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a real-time, noninvasive optical imaging technology that plays a significant role in biomedical research. Nevertheless, the ill-posedness of the inverse problem poses huge challenges in FMT reconstructions. Previous various deep learning algorithms have been extensively explored to address the critical issues, but they remain faces the challenge of high data dependency with poor image quality. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose a FMT reconstruction method based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), termed Diff-FMT, which is capable of obtaining high-quality reconstructed images from noisy images. Specifically, we utilize the noise addition mechanism of DDPM to generate diverse training samples. Through the step-by-step probability sampling mechanism in the inverse process, we achieve fine-grained reconstruction of the image, avoiding issues such as loss of image detail that can occur with end-to-end deep-learning methods. Additionally, we introduce the fluorescence signals as conditional information in the model training to sample a reconstructed image that is highly consistent with the input fluorescence signals from the noisy images. Numerous experimental results show that Diff-FMT can achieve high-resolution reconstruction images without relying on large-scale datasets compared with other cutting-edge algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Lin, Haoran Chen, Dawei Zhu, Xiaoyu Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia. However, there is still considerable debate on constructing MLLM architectures, particularly regarding the selection of appropriate connectors for perception tasks of varying granularities. This paper systematically investigates the impact of connectors on MLLM performance. Specifically, we classify connectors into feature-preserving and feature-compressing types. Utilizing a unified classification standard, we categorize sub-tasks from three comprehensive benchmarks, MMBench, MME, and SEED-Bench, into three task types: coarse-grained perception, fine-grained perception, and reasoning, and evaluate the performance. Our findings reveal that feature-preserving connectors excel in \emph{fine-grained perception} tasks due to their ability to retain detailed visual information. In contrast, feature-compressing connectors, while less effective in fine-grained perception tasks, offer significant speed advantages and perform comparably in \emph{coarse-grained perception} and \emph{reasoning} tasks. These insights are crucial for guiding MLLM architecture design and advancing the optimization of MLLM architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Through automation, deep learning (DL) can enhance the analysis of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) images. However, DL methods require large amounts of high-quality data to produce accurate results, which is difficult to satisfy. Data augmentation is commonly used to tackle this issue. In this work, we develop a pipeline to generate synthetic TEE images and corresponding semantic labels. The proposed data generation pipeline expands on an existing pipeline that generates synthetic transthoracic echocardiography images by transforming slices from anatomical models into synthetic images. We also demonstrate that such images can improve DL network performance through a left-ventricle semantic segmentation task. For the pipeline's unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation section, we explore two generative methods: CycleGAN and contrastive unpaired translation. Next, we evaluate the synthetic images quantitatively using the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) Score and qualitatively through a human perception quiz involving expert cardiologists and the average researcher.
  In this study, we achieve a dice score improvement of up to 10% when we augment datasets with our synthetic images. Furthermore, we compare established methods of assessing unpaired I2I translation and observe a disagreement when evaluating the synthetic images. Finally, we see which metric better predicts the generated data's efficacy when used for data augmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) are a significant challenge, i.e., generating objects that are not presented in the visual input, which impairs their reliability. Recent studies often attribute hallucinations to a lack of understanding of visual input, yet ignore a more fundamental issue: the model's inability to effectively extract or decouple visual features. In this paper, we revisit the hallucinations in LVLMs from an architectural perspective, investigating whether the primary cause lies in the visual encoder (feature extraction) or the modal alignment module (feature decoupling). Motivated by our findings on the preliminary investigation, we propose a novel tuning strategy, PATCH, to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. This plug-and-play method can be integrated into various LVLMs, utilizing adaptive virtual tokens to extract object features from bounding boxes, thereby addressing hallucinations caused by insufficient decoupling of visual features. PATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple multi-modal hallucination datasets. We hope this approach provides researchers with deeper insights into the underlying causes of hallucinations in LVLMs, fostering further advancements and innovation in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyun Yang, Jingge Wang, Guoqing Zhang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The medical image processing field often encounters the critical issue of scarce annotated data. Transfer learning has emerged as a solution, yet how to select an adequate source task and effectively transfer the knowledge to the target task remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel sequential transfer scheme with a task affinity metric tailored for medical images. Considering the characteristics of medical image segmentation tasks, we analyze the image and label similarity between tasks and compute the task affinity scores, which assess the relatedness among tasks. Based on this, we select appropriate source tasks and develop an effective sequential transfer strategy by incorporating intermediate source tasks to gradually narrow the domain discrepancy and minimize the transfer cost. Thereby we identify the best sequential transfer path for the given target task. Extensive experiments on three MRI medical datasets, FeTS 2022, iSeg-2019, and WMH, demonstrate the efficacy of our method in finding the best source sequence. Compared with directly transferring from a single source task, the sequential transfer results underline a significant improvement in target task performance, achieving an average of 2.58% gain in terms of segmentation Dice score, notably, 6.00% for FeTS 2022. Code is available at the git repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deok-Kyeong Jang, Dongseok Yang, Deok-Yun Jang, Byeoli Choi, Donghoon Shin, Sung-hee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salah A. Aly, Ali Bakhiet, Mazen Balat</p>
<p>Abstract: Lymphoma diagnosis, particularly distinguishing between subtypes, is critical for effective treatment but remains challenging due to the subtle morphological differences in histopathological images. This study presents a novel hybrid deep learning framework that combines DenseNet201 for feature extraction with a Dense Neural Network (DNN) for classification, optimized using the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm. The model was trained on a dataset of 15,000 biopsy images, spanning three lymphoma subtypes: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Our approach achieved a testing accuracy of 99.33\%, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and model interpretability. Comprehensive evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC underscores the model's robustness and potential for clinical adoption. This framework offers a scalable solution for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in oncology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Rachid Jennane, Aladine Chetouani, Mohamed Jarraya</p>
<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, and X-rays are commonly used for its diagnosis due to their cost-effectiveness. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), on the other hand, offers detailed soft tissue visualization and has become a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool for KOA. Unfortunately, the high cost and limited accessibility of MRI hinder its widespread use, leaving many patients with KOA reliant solely on X-ray imaging. In this study, we introduce a novel diffusion-based Xray2MRI model capable of generating pseudo-MRI volumes from one single X-ray image. In addition to using X-rays as conditional input, our model integrates target depth, KOA probability distribution, and image intensity distribution modules to guide the synthesis process, ensuring that the generated corresponding slices accurately correspond to the anatomical structures. Experimental results demonstrate that by integrating information from X-rays with additional input data, our proposed approach is capable of generating pseudo-MRI sequences that approximate real MRI scans. Moreover, by increasing the inference times, the model achieves effective interpolation, further improving the continuity and smoothness of the generated MRI sequences, representing one promising initial attempt for cost-effective medical imaging solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel optical flow based approach to enhance the axial resolution of anisotropic 3D EM volumes to achieve isotropic 3D reconstruction. Assuming spatial continuity of 3D biological structures in well aligned EM volumes, we reasoned that optical flow estimation techniques, often applied for temporal resolution enhancement in videos, can be utilized. Pixel level motion is estimated between neighboring 2D slices along z, using spatial gradient flow estimates to interpolate and generate new 2D slices resulting in isotropic voxels. We leverage recent state-of-the-art learning methods for video frame interpolation and transfer learning techniques, and demonstrate the success of our approach on publicly available ultrastructure EM volumes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Rezaei, Mohammad Sabokrou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when learning new classes. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. However, rehearsal-based learning, which retains samples from previous classes, typically achieves good performance but tends to memorize specific instances, struggling with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. This often leads to high forgetting rates and poor generalization. Surprisingly, the OOD generalization capabilities of these methods have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we highlight this issue and propose a simple yet effective strategy inspired by contrastive learning and data-centric principles to address it. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Replay (ACR), a method that employs dual optimization to simultaneously train both the encoder and the classifier. ACR adaptively populates the replay buffer with misclassified samples while ensuring a balanced representation of classes and tasks. By refining the decision boundary in this way, ACR achieves a balance between stability and plasticity. Our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in terms of OOD generalization, achieving an improvement of 13.41\% on Split CIFAR-100, 9.91\% on Split Mini-ImageNet, and 5.98\% on Split Tiny-ImageNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Choonghan Kim, Seonhee Cho, Joo Heung Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) are gaining use in clinical settings, but their performance can suffer with incomplete radiology reports. We tested whether multimodal LLMs (using text and images) could improve accuracy and understanding in chest radiography reports, making them more effective for clinical decision support.
  Purpose: To assess the robustness of LLMs in generating accurate impressions from chest radiography reports using both incomplete data and multimodal data. Material and Methods: We used 300 radiology image-report pairs from the MIMIC-CXR database. Three LLMs (OpenFlamingo, MedFlamingo, IDEFICS) were tested in both text-only and multimodal formats. Impressions were first generated from the full text, then tested by removing 20%, 50%, and 80% of the text. The impact of adding images was evaluated using chest x-rays, and model performance was compared using three metrics with statistical analysis.
  Results: The text-only models (OpenFlamingo, MedFlamingo, IDEFICS) had similar performance (ROUGE-L: 0.39 vs. 0.21 vs. 0.21; F1RadGraph: 0.34 vs. 0.17 vs. 0.17; F1CheXbert: 0.53 vs. 0.40 vs. 0.40), with OpenFlamingo performing best on complete text (p<0.001). Performance declined with incomplete data across all models. However, adding images significantly boosted the performance of MedFlamingo and IDEFICS (p<0.001), equaling or surpassing OpenFlamingo, even with incomplete text. Conclusion: LLMs may produce low-quality outputs with incomplete radiology data, but multimodal LLMs can improve reliability and support clinical decision-making.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erzhen Hu, Mingyi Li, Jungtaek Hong, Xun Qian, Alex Olwal, David Kim, Seongkook Heo, Ruofei Du</p>
<p>Abstract: During remote communication, participants often share both digital and physical content, such as product designs, digital assets, and environments, to enhance mutual understanding. Recent advances in augmented communication have facilitated users to swiftly create and share digital 2D copies of physical objects from video feeds into a shared space. However, conventional 2D representations of digital objects restricts users' ability to spatially reference items in a shared immersive environment. To address this, we propose Thing2Reality, an Extended Reality (XR) communication platform that enhances spontaneous discussions of both digital and physical items during remote sessions. With Thing2Reality, users can quickly materialize ideas or physical objects in immersive environments and share them as conditioned multiview renderings or 3D Gaussians. Thing2Reality enables users to interact with remote objects or discuss concepts in a collaborative manner. Our user study revealed that the ability to interact with and manipulate 3D representations of objects significantly enhances the efficiency of discussions, with the potential to augment discussion of 2D artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjung Park, Suhyun Ahn, Jinah Park</p>
<p>Abstract: The deformation of the lateral ventricle (LV) shape is widely studied to identify specific morphometric changes associated with diseases. Since LV enlargement is considered a relative change due to brain atrophy, local longitudinal LV deformation can indicate deformation in adjacent brain areas. However, conventional methods for LV shape analysis focus on modeling the solely segmented LV mask. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach using peripheral area projection, which is the first attempt to analyze LV considering its surrounding areas. Our approach matches the baseline LV mesh by deforming the shape of follow-up LVs, while optimizing the corresponding points of the same adjacent brain area between the baseline and follow-up LVs. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluated the deformation of the left LV in normal (n=10) and demented subjects (n=10), and we found that each surrounding area (thalamus, caudate, hippocampus, amygdala, and right LV) projected onto the surface of LV shows noticeable differences between normal and demented subjects.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a Graph-QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jona Ruthardt, Gertjan J. Burghouts, Serge Belongie, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: How well do text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) grasp the visual world? As LLMs are increasingly used in computer vision, addressing this question becomes both fundamental and pertinent. However, existing studies have primarily focused on limited scenarios, such as their ability to generate visual content or cluster multimodal data. To this end, we propose the Visual Text Representation Benchmark (ViTeRB) to isolate key properties that make language models well-aligned with the visual world. With this, we identify large-scale decoder-based LLMs as ideal candidates for representing text in vision-centric contexts, counter to the current practice of utilizing text encoders. Building on these findings, we propose ShareLock, an ultra-lightweight CLIP-like model. By leveraging precomputable frozen features from strong vision and language models, ShareLock achieves an impressive 51% accuracy on ImageNet despite utilizing just 563k image-caption pairs. Moreover, training requires only 1 GPU hour (or 10 hours including the precomputation of features) - orders of magnitude less than prior methods. Code will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a simple and effective approach for non-blind image deblurring, combining classical techniques and deep learning. In contrast to existing methods that deblur the image directly in the standard image space, we propose to perform an explicit deconvolution process in a feature space by integrating a classical Wiener deconvolution framework with learned deep features. A multi-scale cascaded feature refinement module then predicts the deblurred image from the deconvolved deep features, progressively recovering detail and small-scale structures. The proposed model is trained in an end-to-end manner and evaluated on scenarios with simulated Gaussian noise, saturated pixels, or JPEG compression artifacts as well as real-world images. Moreover, we present detailed analyses of the benefit of the feature-based Wiener deconvolution and of the multi-scale cascaded feature refinement as well as the robustness of the proposed approach. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed deep Wiener deconvolution network facilitates deblurred results with visibly fewer artifacts and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art non-blind image deblurring methods by a wide margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-spectral face recognition (CFR) refers to recognizing individuals using face images stemming from different spectral bands, such as infrared versus visible. While CFR is inherently more challenging than classical face recognition due to significant variation in facial appearance caused by the modality gap, it is useful in many scenarios including night-vision biometrics and detecting presentation attacks. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have resulted in significant improvement in the performance of CFR systems. Given these developments, the contributions of this survey are three-fold. First, we provide an overview of CFR, by formalizing the CFR problem and presenting related applications. Secondly, we discuss the appropriate spectral bands for face recognition and discuss recent CFR methods, placing emphasis on deep neural networks. In particular we describe techniques that have been proposed to extract and compare heterogeneous features emerging from different spectral bands. We also discuss the datasets that have been used for evaluating CFR methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future lines of research on this topic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image restoration tasks have witnessed great performance improvement in recent years by developing large deep models. Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Savadikar, Michelle Dai, Tianfu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies task-incremental continual learning (TCL) using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Our goal is to improve the overall streaming-task performance without catastrophic forgetting by learning task synergies (e.g., a new task learns to automatically reuse/adapt modules from previous similar tasks, or to introduce new modules when needed, or to skip some modules when it appears to be an easier task). One grand challenge is how to tame ViTs at streaming diverse tasks in terms of balancing their plasticity and stability in a task-aware way while overcoming the catastrophic forgetting. To address the challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that identifies a lightweight yet expressive ``sweet spot'' in the ViT block as the task-synergy memory in TCL. We present a Hierarchical task-synergy Exploration-Exploitation (HEE) sampling based neural architecture search (NAS) method for effectively learning task synergies by structurally updating the identified memory component with respect to four basic operations (reuse, adapt, new and skip) at streaming tasks. The proposed method is thus dubbed as CHEEM (Continual Hierarchical-Exploration-Exploitation Memory). In experiments, we test the proposed CHEEM on the challenging Visual Domain Decathlon (VDD) benchmark and the 5-Dataset benchmark. It obtains consistently better performance than the prior art with sensible CHEEM learned continually.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study challenging problems of estimating the relative pose of three cameras and propose novel efficient solutions to the configurations (1) of four points in three calibrated cameras (the 4p3v problem), and (2) of four points in three cameras with unknown shared focal length (the 4p3vf problem). Our solutions are based on the simple idea of generating one or two additional virtual point correspondences in two views by using the information from the locations of the input correspondences. We generate such correspondences using a very simple and efficient strategy, where the new points are the mean points of three corresponding input points. The new solvers are efficient and easy to implement, since they are based on existing efficient minimal solvers, i.e., the well-known 5-point and 6-point relative pose solvers and the P3P solver. Extensive experiments on real data show that our solvers achieve state-of-the-art results. We also present a simple network that can improve the precision of the mean-point correspondences, showing the potential to learn better virtual point correspondences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiafeng Mao, Xueting Wang, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have the ability to generate high quality images by denoising pure Gaussian noise images. While previous research has primarily focused on improving the control of image generation through adjusting the denoising process, we propose a novel direction of manipulating the initial noise to control the generated image. Through experiments on stable diffusion, we show that blocks of pixels in the initial latent images have a preference for generating specific content, and that modifying these blocks can significantly influence the generated image. In particular, we show that modifying a part of the initial image affects the corresponding region of the generated image while leaving other regions unaffected, which is useful for repainting tasks. Furthermore, we find that the generation preferences of pixel blocks are primarily determined by their values, rather than their position. By moving pixel blocks with a tendency to generate user-desired content to user-specified regions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout-to-image generation. Our results highlight the flexibility and power of initial image manipulation in controlling the generated image. Project Page: https://ut-mao.github.io/swap.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhui Lei, Xu Wei, Xiaofan Zhang, Kang Li, Shaoting Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have shown significant potential in medical image analysis. However, there is still a gap in models specifically designed for medical image localization. To address this, we introduce MedLAM, a 3D medical foundation localization model that accurately identifies any anatomical part within the body using only a few template scans. MedLAM employs two self-supervision tasks: unified anatomical mapping (UAM) and multi-scale similarity (MSS) across a comprehensive dataset of 14,012 CT scans. Furthermore, we developed MedLSAM by integrating MedLAM with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This innovative framework requires extreme point annotations across three directions on several templates to enable MedLAM to locate the target anatomical structure in the image, with SAM performing the segmentation. It significantly reduces the amount of manual annotation required by SAM in 3D medical imaging scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments on two 3D datasets covering 38 distinct organs. Our findings are twofold: 1) MedLAM can directly localize anatomical structures using just a few template scans, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models; 2) MedLSAM closely matches the performance of SAM and its specialized medical adaptations with manual prompts, while minimizing the need for extensive point annotations across the entire dataset. Moreover, MedLAM has the potential to be seamlessly integrated with future 3D SAM models, paving the way for enhanced segmentation performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hieu Le, Jingyi Xu, Nicolas Talabot, Jiancheng Yang, Pascal Fua</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical applications often require accurate 3D representations of complex organs with multiple parts, such as the heart and spine. Their individual parts must adhere to specific topological constraints to ensure proper functionality. Yet, there are very few mechanisms in the deep learning literature to achieve this goal.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to enforce topological constraints in 3D object reconstruction using deep implicit signed distance functions. Our method focuses on heart and spine reconstruction but is generalizable to other applications. We propose a sampling-based technique that effectively checks and enforces topological constraints between 3D shapes by evaluating signed distances at randomly sampled points throughout the volume. We demonstrate it by refining 3D segmentations obtained from the nn-UNet architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Azeem Aslam, Xu Wei, Hassan Khalid, Nisar Ahmed, Zhu Shuangtong, Xin Liu, Yimei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: BIQA (Blind Image Quality Assessment) is an important field of study that evaluates images automatically. Although significant progress has been made, blind image quality assessment remains a difficult task since images vary in content and distortions. Most algorithms generate quality without emphasizing the important region of interest. In order to solve this, a multi-stream spatial and channel attention-based algorithm is being proposed. This algorithm generates more accurate predictions with a high correlation to human perceptual assessment by combining hybrid features from two different backbones, followed by spatial and channel attention to provide high weights to the region of interest. Four legacy image quality assessment datasets are used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Authentic and synthetic distortion image databases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we show that it has excellent generalization properties with a particular focus on the perceptual foreground information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Shen, Dong Zhang, Zhao Zhang, Liyong Fu, Qiaolin Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, instance segmentation has garnered significant attention across various applications. However, training a fully-supervised instance segmentation model requires costly both instance-level and pixel-level annotations. In contrast, weakly-supervised instance segmentation methods, such as those using image-level class labels or point labels, often struggle to satisfy the accuracy and recall requirements of practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm called Synthetic Instance Segmentation (SISeg). SISeg achieves instance segmentation results by leveraging image masks generated by existing semantic segmentation models, and it is highly efficient as we do not require additional training for semantic segmentation or the use of instance-level image annotations. In other words, the proposed model does not need extra manpower or higher computational expenses. Specifically, we first obtain a semantic segmentation mask of the input image via an existent semantic segmentation model. Then, we calculate a displacement field vector for each pixel based on the segmentation mask, which can indicate representations belonging to the same class but different instances, i.e., obtaining the instance-level object information. Finally, the instance segmentation results are refined by a learnable category-agnostic object boundary branch. Extensive experimental results on two challenging datasets highlight the effectiveness of SISeg in achieving competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially fully-supervised methods. The code will be released at: SISeg</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Lu, Xing Zhang, Jiaxi Gu, Renjing Pei, Songcen Xu, Xingjun Ma, Hang Xu, Zuxuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are renowned for their powerful capabilities in image and video synthesis. Yet, compared to text-to-image (T2I) editing, text-to-video (T2V) editing suffers from a lack of decent temporal consistency and structure, due to insufficient pre-training data, limited model editability, or extensive tuning costs. To address this gap, we propose FLDM (Fused Latent Diffusion Model), a training-free framework that achieves high-quality T2V editing by integrating various T2I and T2V LDMs. Specifically, FLDM utilizes a hyper-parameter with an update schedule to effectively fuse image and video latents during the denoising process. This paper is the first to reveal that T2I and T2V LDMs can complement each other in terms of structure and temporal consistency, ultimately generating high-quality videos. It is worth noting that FLDM can serve as a versatile plugin, applicable to off-the-shelf image and video LDMs, to significantly enhance the quality of video editing. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on popular T2I and T2V LDMs demonstrate FLDM's superior editing quality than state-of-the-art T2V editing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Chindemi, Benoit Girard, Camilla Bellone</p>
<p>Abstract: Social behavior is crucial for survival in many animal species, and a heavily investigated research subject. Current analysis methods generally rely on measuring animal interaction time or annotating predefined behaviors. However, these approaches are time consuming, human biased, and can fail to capture subtle behaviors. Here we introduce LISBET (LISBET Is a Social BEhavior Transformer), a machine learning model for detecting and segmenting social interactions. Using self-supervised learning on body tracking data, our model eliminates the need for extensive human annotation. We tested LISBET in three scenarios across multiple datasets in mice: supervised behavior classification, unsupervised motifs segmentation, and unsupervised animal phenotyping. Additionally, in vivo electrophysiology revealed distinct neural signatures in the Ventral Tegmental Area corresponding to motifs identified by our model. In summary, LISBET automates data annotation and reduces human bias in social behavior research, offering a promising approach to enhance our understanding of behavior and its neural correlates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kecen Li, Chen Gong, Zhixiang Li, Yuzhong Zhao, Xinwen Hou, Tianhao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) image data synthesis, which leverages the DP technique to generate synthetic data to replace the sensitive data, allowing organizations to share and utilize synthetic images without privacy concerns. Previous methods incorporate the advanced techniques of generative models and pre-training on a public dataset to produce exceptional DP image data, but suffer from problems of unstable training and massive computational resource demands. This paper proposes a novel DP image synthesis method, termed PRIVIMAGE, which meticulously selects pre-training data, promoting the efficient creation of DP datasets with high fidelity and utility. PRIVIMAGE first establishes a semantic query function using a public dataset. Then, this function assists in querying the semantic distribution of the sensitive dataset, facilitating the selection of data from the public dataset with analogous semantics for pre-training. Finally, we pre-train an image generative model using the selected data and then fine-tune this model on the sensitive dataset using Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). PRIVIMAGE allows us to train a lightly parameterized generative model, reducing the noise in the gradient during DP-SGD training and enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIVIMAGE uses only 1% of the public dataset for pre-training and 7.6% of the parameters in the generative model compared to the state-of-the-art method, whereas achieves superior synthetic performance and conserves more computational resources. On average, PRIVIMAGE achieves 30.1% lower FID and 12.6% higher Classification Accuracy than the state-of-the-art method. The replication package and datasets can be accessed online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Jinjin Gu, Xin Yuan, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) methods typically model degradation to improve reconstruction accuracy in complex and unknown degradation scenarios. However, extracting degradation information from low-resolution images is challenging, which limits the model performance. To boost image SR performance, one feasible approach is to introduce additional priors. Inspired by advancements in multi-modal methods and text prompt image processing, we introduce text prompts to image SR to provide degradation priors. Specifically, we first design a text-image generation pipeline to integrate text into the SR dataset through the text degradation representation and degradation model. The text representation applies a discretization manner based on the binning method to describe the degradation abstractly. This method maintains the flexibility of the text and is user-friendly. Meanwhile, we propose the PromptSR to realize the text prompt SR. The PromptSR utilizes the pre-trained language model (e.g., T5 or CLIP) to enhance restoration. We train the PromptSR on the generated text-image dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that introducing text prompts into SR, yields excellent results on both synthetic and real-world images.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14552">Griffon: Spelling out All Object Locations at Any Granularity with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Zhan, Yousong Zhu, Zhiyang Chen, Fan Yang, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Replicating the innate human ability to detect all objects based on free-form texts at any granularity remains a formidable challenge for Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Current LVLMs are predominantly constrained to locate a single, pre-existing object. This limitation leads to a compromise in model design, necessitating the introduction of visual expert models or customized head structures. Beyond these constraints, our research uncovers LVLMs' capability for basic object perception, allowing them to accurately identify and locate objects of interest. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel Language-prompted Localization Dataset to fully unleash the capabilities of LVLMs in fine-grained object perception and precise location awareness. More importantly, we present Griffon, a purely LVLM-based baseline, which does not introduce any special tokens, expert models, or additional detection modules. It simply maintains a consistent structure with popular LVLMs by unifying data formats across various localization-related scenarios and is trained end-to-end through a well-designed pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Griffon not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the fine-grained RefCOCO series and Flickr30K Entities but also approaches the capabilities of the expert model Faster RCNN on the detection benchmark MSCOCO.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Li, Qiang Han, Mengying Yu, Yuxin Jiang, Chaikiat Yeo, Yiheng Li, Zihang Huang, Nini Liu, Hsuanhan Chen, Xiaojun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object detection in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space has recently emerged as a prevalent approach in the field of autonomous driving. Despite the demonstrated improvements in accuracy and velocity estimation compared to perspective view methods, the deployment of BEV-based techniques in real-world autonomous vehicles remains challenging. This is primarily due to their reliance on vision-transformer (ViT) based architectures, which introduce quadratic complexity with respect to the input resolution. To address this issue, we propose an efficient BEV-based 3D detection framework called BEVENet, which leverages a convolutional-only architectural design to circumvent the limitations of ViT models while maintaining the effectiveness of BEV-based methods. Our experiments show that BEVENet is 3$\times$ faster than contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the NuScenes challenge, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.456 and a nuScenes detection score (NDS) of 0.555 on the NuScenes validation dataset, with an inference speed of 47.6 frames per second. To the best of our knowledge, this study stands as the first to achieve such significant efficiency improvements for BEV-based methods, highlighting their enhanced feasibility for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiafeng Mao, Xueting Wang, Kiyoharu Aizawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models allow users control over the content of generated images. Still, text-to-image generation occasionally leads to generation failure requiring users to generate dozens of images under the same text prompt before they obtain a satisfying result. We formulate the lottery ticket hypothesis in denoising: randomly initialized Gaussian noise images contain special pixel blocks (winning tickets) that naturally tend to be denoised into specific content independently. The generation failure in standard text-to-image synthesis is caused by the gap between optimal and actual spatial distribution of winning tickets in initial noisy images. To this end, we implement semantic-driven initial image construction creating initial noise from known winning tickets for each concept mentioned in the prompt. We conduct a series of experiments that verify the properties of winning tickets and demonstrate their generalizability across images and prompts. Our results show that aggregating winning tickets into the initial noise image effectively induce the model to generate the specified object at the corresponding location.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Haghighi, Mehrdad Dianati, Valentina Donzella, Kurt Debattista</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation models for perception sensors are integral components of automotive simulators used for the virtual Verification and Validation (V\&V) of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). These models also serve as powerful tools for generating synthetic datasets to train deep learning-based perception models. Lidar is a widely used sensor type among the perception sensors for ADS due to its high precision in 3D environment scanning. However, developing realistic Lidar simulation models is a significant technical challenge. In particular, unrealistic models can result in a large gap between the synthesised and real-world point clouds, limiting their effectiveness in ADS applications. Recently, deep generative models have emerged as promising solutions to synthesise realistic sensory data. However, for Lidar simulation, deep generative models have been primarily hybridised with conventional algorithms, leaving unified generative approaches largely unexplored in the literature. Motivated by this research gap, we propose a unified generative framework to enhance Lidar simulation fidelity. Our proposed framework projects Lidar point clouds into depth-reflectance images via a lossless transformation, and employs our novel Controllable Lidar point cloud Generative model, CoLiGen, to translate the images. We extensively evaluate our CoLiGen model, comparing it with the state-of-the-art image-to-image translation models using various metrics to assess the realness, faithfulness, and performance of a downstream perception model. Our results show that CoLiGen exhibits superior performance across most metrics. The dataset and source code for this research are available at https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/CoLiGen.git.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many domains. However, the model's capability to follow natural language instructions (e.g., spatial relationships between objects, generating complex scenes) is still unsatisfactory. In this work, we propose Iterative Prompt Relabeling (IPR), a novel algorithm that aligns images to text through iterative image sampling and prompt relabeling with feedback. IPR first samples a batch of images conditioned on the text, then relabels the text prompts of unmatched text-image pairs with classifier feedback. We conduct thorough experiments on SDv2 and SDXL, testing their capability to follow instructions on spatial relations. With IPR, we improved up to 15.22% (absolute improvement) on the challenging spatial relation VISOR benchmark, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous RL methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joao P. C. Bertoldo, Dick Ameln, Ashwin Vaidya, Samet Ak\c{c}ay</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in visual anomaly detection research have seen AUROC and AUPRO scores on public benchmark datasets such as MVTec and VisA converge towards perfect recall, giving the impression that these benchmarks are near-solved. However, high AUROC and AUPRO scores do not always reflect qualitative performance, which limits the validity of these metrics in real-world applications. We argue that the artificial ceiling imposed by the lack of an adequate evaluation metric restrains progression of the field, and it is crucial that we revisit the evaluation metrics used to rate our algorithms. In response, we introduce Per-IMage Overlap (PIMO), a novel metric that addresses the shortcomings of AUROC and AUPRO. PIMO retains the recall-based nature of the existing metrics but introduces two distinctions: the assignment of curves (and respective area under the curve) is per-image, and its X-axis relies solely on normal images. Measuring recall per image simplifies instance score indexing and is more robust to noisy annotations. As we show, it also accelerates computation and enables the usage of statistical tests to compare models. By imposing low tolerance for false positives on normal images, PIMO provides an enhanced model validation procedure and highlights performance variations across datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that PIMO offers practical advantages and nuanced performance insights that redefine anomaly detection benchmarks -- notably challenging the perception that MVTec AD and VisA datasets have been solved by contemporary models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibin He, Maoyuan Ye, Jing Zhang, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond the text detection and recognition tasks in image text spotting, video text spotting presents an augmented challenge with the inclusion of tracking. While advanced end-to-end trainable methods have shown commendable performance, the pursuit of multi-task optimization may pose the risk of producing sub-optimal outcomes for individual tasks. In this paper, we identify a main bottleneck in the state-of-the-art video text spotter: the limited recognition capability. In response to this issue, we propose to efficiently turn an off-the-shelf query-based image text spotter into a specialist on video and present a simple baseline termed GoMatching, which focuses the training efforts on tracking while maintaining strong recognition performance. To adapt the image text spotter to video datasets, we add a rescoring head to rescore each detected instance's confidence via efficient tuning, leading to a better tracking candidate pool. Additionally, we design a long-short term matching module, termed LST-Matcher, to enhance the spotter's tracking capability by integrating both long- and short-term matching results via Transformer. Based on the above simple designs, GoMatching delivers new records on ICDAR15-video, DSText, BOVText, and our proposed novel test with arbitrary-shaped text termed ArTVideo, which demonstrates GoMatching's capability to accommodate general, dense, small, arbitrary-shaped, Chinese and English text scenarios while saving considerable training budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Bryan Bo Cao, Kristin Dana, Shubham Jain, Ashwin Ashok</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation follows the intuition that humans can navigate without detailed maps. A common approach is interactive exploration while building a topological graph with images at nodes that can be used for planning. Recent variations learn from passive videos and can navigate using complex social and semantic cues. However, a significant number of training videos are needed, large graphs are utilized, and scenes are not unseen since odometry is utilized. We introduce a new approach to visual navigation using feudal learning, which employs a hierarchical structure consisting of a worker agent, a mid-level manager, and a high-level manager. Key to the feudal learning paradigm, agents at each level see a different aspect of the task and operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Two unique modules are developed in this framework. For the high-level manager, we learn a memory proxy map in a self supervised manner to record prior observations in a learned latent space and avoid the use of graphs and odometry. For the mid-level manager, we develop a waypoint network that outputs intermediate subgoals imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. This waypoint network is pre-trained using a new, small set of teleoperation videos that we make publicly available, with training environments different from testing environments. The resulting feudal navigation network achieves near SOTA performance, while providing a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry, no-metric map approach to the image goal navigation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hashmat Shadab Malik, Muhammad Huzaifa, Muzammal Naseer, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the large-scale multi-modal training of recent vision-based models and their generalization capabilities, understanding the extent of their robustness is critical for their real-world deployment. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background context variations. The majority of robustness evaluation methods have introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics (viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques (adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in distributions. Recent works have explored leveraging large language models and diffusion models to generate changes in the background. However, these methods either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task. Our method, on the other hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object. To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models. We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Fan, Amal Trigui, Thomas B\"ack, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A great interest has arisen in using Deep Generative Models (DGM) for generative design. When assessing the quality of the generated designs, human designers focus more on structural plausibility, e.g., no missing component, rather than visual artifacts, e.g., noises or blurriness. Meanwhile, commonly used metrics such as Fre\'chet Inception Distance (FID) may not evaluate accurately because they are sensitive to visual artifacts and tolerant to semantic errors. As such, FID might not be suitable to assess the performance of DGMs for a generative design task. In this work, we propose to encode the to-be-evaluated images with a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and measure the distribution distance in the resulting latent space. Hereby, we design a novel metric Fre\'chet Denoised Distance (FDD). We experimentally test our FDD, FID and other state-of-the-art metrics on multiple datasets, e.g., BIKED, Seeing3DChairs, FFHQ and ImageNet. Our FDD can effectively detect implausible structures and is more consistent with structural inspections by human experts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Knab, Sascha Marton, Christian Bartelt</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence is critical in unraveling decision-making processes in complex machine learning models. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a well-known XAI framework for image analysis. It utilizes image segmentation to create features to identify relevant areas for classification. Consequently, poor segmentation can compromise the consistency of the explanation and undermine the importance of the segments, affecting the overall interpretability. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME), featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation, and ii) a hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. We benchmark DSEG-LIME on pre-trained models with images from the ImageNet dataset - scenarios without domain-specific knowledge. The analysis includes a quantitative evaluation using established XAI metrics, complemented by a qualitative assessment through a user study. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms in most of the XAI metrics and enhances the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts, significantly improving interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hala Djeghim, Nathan Piasco, Moussab Bennehar, Luis Rold\~ao, Dzmitry Tsishkou, D\'esir\'e Sidib\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural implicit surface representation methods have recently shown impressive 3D reconstruction results. However, existing solutions struggle to reconstruct urban outdoor scenes due to their large, unbounded, and highly detailed nature. Hence, to achieve accurate reconstructions, additional supervision data such as LiDAR, strong geometric priors, and long training times are required. To tackle such issues, we present SCILLA, a new hybrid implicit surface learning method to reconstruct large driving scenes from 2D images. SCILLA's hybrid architecture models two separate implicit fields: one for the volumetric density and another for the signed distance to the surface. To accurately represent urban outdoor scenarios, we introduce a novel volume-rendering strategy that relies on self-supervised probabilistic density estimation to sample points near the surface and transition progressively from volumetric to surface representation. Our solution permits a proper and fast initialization of the signed distance field without relying on any geometric prior on the scene, compared to concurrent methods. By conducting extensive experiments on four outdoor driving datasets, we show that SCILLA can learn an accurate and detailed 3D surface scene representation in various urban scenarios while being two times faster to train compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Li, Weixi Feng, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Consistency Distillation (LCD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient text-to-image synthesis. By distilling a latent consistency model (LCM) from a pre-trained teacher latent diffusion model (LDM), LCD facilitates the generation of high-fidelity images within merely 2 to 4 inference steps. However, the LCM's efficient inference is obtained at the cost of the sample quality. In this paper, we propose compensating the quality loss by aligning LCM's output with human preference during training. Specifically, we introduce Reward Guided LCD (RG-LCD), which integrates feedback from a reward model (RM) into the LCD process by augmenting the original LCD loss with the objective of maximizing the reward associated with LCM's single-step generation. As validated through human evaluation, when trained with the feedback of a good RM, the 2-step generations from our RG-LCM are favored by humans over the 50-step DDIM samples from the teacher LDM, representing a 25-time inference acceleration without quality loss.
  As directly optimizing towards differentiable RMs can suffer from over-optimization, we take the initial step to overcome this difficulty by proposing the use of a latent proxy RM (LRM). This novel component serves as an intermediary, connecting our LCM with the RM. Empirically, we demonstrate that incorporating the LRM into our RG-LCD successfully avoids high-frequency noise in the generated images, contributing to both improved Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) on MS-COCO and a higher HPSv2.1 score on HPSv2's test set, surpassing those achieved by the baseline LCM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Zhu, Jiale Cao, Jin Xie, Shuangming Yang, Yanwei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary video instance segmentation strives to segment and track instances belonging to an open set of categories in a videos. The vision-language model Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown robust zero-shot classification ability in image-level open-vocabulary tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder network, called CLIP-VIS, to adapt CLIP for open-vocabulary video instance segmentation. Our CLIP-VIS adopts frozen CLIP and introduces three modules, including class-agnostic mask generation, temporal topK-enhanced matching, and weighted open-vocabulary classification. Given a set of initial queries, class-agnostic mask generation introduces a pixel decoder and a transformer decoder on CLIP pre-trained image encoder to predict query masks and corresponding object scores and mask IoU scores. Then, temporal topK-enhanced matching performs query matching across frames using the K mostly matched frames. Finally, weighted open-vocabulary classification first employs mask pooling to generate query visual features from CLIP pre-trained image encoder, and second performs weighted classification using object scores and mask IoU scores. Our CLIP-VIS does not require the annotations of instance categories and identities. The experiments are performed on various video instance segmentation datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, especially for novel categories. When using ConvNeXt-B as backbone, our CLIP-VIS achieves the AP and APn scores of 32.2% and 40.2% on the validation set of LV-VIS dataset, which outperforms OV2Seg by 11.1% and 23.9% respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timo Kaiser, Maximilian Schier, Bodo Rosenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics, current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency and the ability to reconstruct lineage trees correctly. To address this issue, we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for motion estimation frameworks and extend the multi-hypothesis tracking framework. Our uncertainty estimation lifts motion representations into probabilistic spatial densities using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Moreover, we introduce a novel mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation that allows multi-hypothesis trackers to model cell splits and to resolve false associations and mitosis detections based on long-term conflicts. In our framework, explicit biological knowledge is modeled in assignment costs. We evaluate our approach on nine competitive datasets and demonstrate that we outperform the current state-of-the-art on biologically inspired metrics substantially, achieving improvements by a factor of approximately 6 and uncover new insights into the behavior of motion estimation uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Svitov, Pietro Morerio, Lourdes Agapito, Alessio Del Bue</p>
<p>Abstract: We present HAHA - a novel approach for animatable human avatar generation from monocular input videos. The proposed method relies on learning the trade-off between the use of Gaussian splatting and a textured mesh for efficient and high fidelity rendering. We demonstrate its efficiency to animate and render full-body human avatars controlled via the SMPL-X parametric model. Our model learns to apply Gaussian splatting only in areas of the SMPL-X mesh where it is necessary, like hair and out-of-mesh clothing. This results in a minimal number of Gaussians being used to represent the full avatar, and reduced rendering artifacts. This allows us to handle the animation of small body parts such as fingers that are traditionally disregarded. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two open datasets: SnapshotPeople and X-Humans. Our method demonstrates on par reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art on SnapshotPeople, while using less than a third of Gaussians. HAHA outperforms previous state-of-the-art on novel poses from X-Humans both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present AGL-NET, a novel learning-based method for global localization using LiDAR point clouds and satellite maps. AGL-NET tackles two critical challenges: bridging the representation gap between image and points modalities for robust feature matching, and handling inherent scale discrepancies between global view and local view. To address these challenges, AGL-NET leverages a unified network architecture with a novel two-stage matching design. The first stage extracts informative neural features directly from raw sensor data and performs initial feature matching. The second stage refines this matching process by extracting informative skeleton features and incorporating a novel scale alignment step to rectify scale variations between LiDAR and map data. Furthermore, a novel scale and skeleton loss function guides the network toward learning scale-invariant feature representations, eliminating the need for pre-processing satellite maps. This significantly improves real-world applicability in scenarios with unknown map scales. To facilitate rigorous performance evaluation, we introduce a meticulously designed dataset within the CARLA simulator specifically tailored for metric localization training and assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasi Zhang, Peiyu Yu, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great success in generating high-quality text-guided images. Yet, these models may still fail to semantically align generated images with the provided text prompts, leading to problems like incorrect attribute binding and/or catastrophic object neglect. Given the pervasive object-oriented structure underlying text prompts, we introduce a novel object-conditioned Energy-Based Attention Map Alignment (EBAMA) method to address the aforementioned problems. We show that an object-centric attribute binding loss naturally emerges by approximately maximizing the log-likelihood of a $z$-parameterized energy-based model with the help of the negative sampling technique. We further propose an object-centric intensity regularizer to prevent excessive shifts of objects attention towards their attributes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, including human evaluation, on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method over previous strong counterparts. With better aligned attention maps, our approach shows great promise in further enhancing the text-controlled image editing ability of diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Zhong, Yao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has shifted the paradigm of adapting pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), achieving great efficiency by updating only a subset of tailored parameters to approximate weight updates. However, the multi-head design of the self-attention mechanism, with the heads working in parallel in the computation flow, exhibiting similar visual patterns and requiring update over all of them, incurs unnecessary storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Head-level responsiveness tuning for low-rank adaptation (Heart-LoRA). The proposed method explores redundancy among the heads and selectively activates task-responsive heads, thus enabling fine-grained head-level tuning. Additionally, given the different responsiveness of heads to diverse visual tasks, our proposed method dynamically activates a subset of the approximated heads that are tailored to the current task. Experimental results show that Heart-LoRA yields superior performance over state-of-the-art PETL approaches on visual adaptation benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changki Sung, Wanhee Kim, Jungho An, Wooju Lee, Hyungtae Lim, Hyun Myung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite great improvements in semantic segmentation, challenges persist because of the lack of local/global contexts and the relationship between them. In this paper, we propose Contextrast, a contrastive learning-based semantic segmentation method that allows to capture local/global contexts and comprehend their relationships. Our proposed method comprises two parts: a) contextual contrastive learning (CCL) and b) boundary-aware negative (BANE) sampling. Contextual contrastive learning obtains local/global context from multi-scale feature aggregation and inter/intra-relationship of features for better discrimination capabilities. Meanwhile, BANE sampling selects embedding features along the boundaries of incorrectly predicted regions to employ them as harder negative samples on our contrastive learning, resolving segmentation issues along the boundary region by exploiting fine-grained details. We demonstrate that our Contextrast substantially enhances the performance of semantic segmentation networks, outperforming state-of-the-art contrastive learning approaches on diverse public datasets, e.g. Cityscapes, CamVid, PASCAL-C, COCO-Stuff, and ADE20K, without an increase in computational cost during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongze Hao, Qunbo Wang, Longteng Guo, Jie Jiang, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While large visual-language models (LVLM) have shown promising results on traditional visual question answering benchmarks, it is still challenging for them to answer complex VQA problems which requires diverse world knowledge. Motivated by the research of retrieval-augmented generation in the field of natural language processing, we use Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve related knowledge to help the model answer questions. However, DPR conduct retrieving in natural language space, which may not ensure comprehensive acquisition of image information. Thus, the retrieved knowledge is not truly conducive to helping answer the question, affecting the performance of the overall system. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages the visual-language model to select the key knowledge retrieved by DPR and answer questions. The framework consists of two modules: Selector and Answerer, where both are initialized by the LVLM and parameter-efficiently finetuned by self-bootstrapping: find key knowledge in the retrieved knowledge documents using the Selector, and then use them to finetune the Answerer to predict answers; obtain the pseudo-labels of key knowledge documents based on the predictions of the Answerer and weak supervision labels, and then finetune the Selector to select key knowledge; repeat. Our framework significantly enhances the performance of the baseline on the challenging open-domain Knowledge-based VQA benchmark, OK-VQA, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.83%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsong Zhang, Zisong Chen, Chunyu Lin, Lang Nie, Zhijie Shen, Kang Liao, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoramic distortion poses a significant challenge in 360 depth estimation, particularly pronounced at the north and south poles. Existing methods either adopt a bi-projection fusion strategy to remove distortions or model long-range dependencies to capture global structures, which can result in either unclear structure or insufficient local perception. In this paper, we propose a spherical geometry transformer, named SGFormer, to address the above issues, with an innovative step to integrate spherical geometric priors into vision transformers. To this end, we retarget the transformer decoder to a spherical prior decoder (termed SPDecoder), which endeavors to uphold the integrity of spherical structures during decoding. Concretely, we leverage bipolar re-projection, circular rotation, and curve local embedding to preserve the spherical characteristics of equidistortion, continuity, and surface distance, respectively. Furthermore, we present a query-based global conditional position embedding to compensate for spatial structure at varying resolutions. It not only boosts the global perception of spatial position but also sharpens the depth structure across different patches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, demonstrating our superiority over state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khai Nguyen, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for video inpainting typically rely on optical flow or attention-based approaches to inpaint masked regions by propagating visual information across frames. While such approaches have led to significant progress on standard benchmarks, they struggle with tasks that require the synthesis of novel content that is not present in other frames. In this paper, we reframe video inpainting as a conditional generative modeling problem and present a framework for solving such problems with conditional video diffusion models. We introduce inpainting-specific sampling schemes which capture crucial long-range dependencies in the context, and devise a novel method for conditioning on the known pixels in incomplete frames. We highlight the advantages of using a generative approach for this task, showing that our method is capable of generating diverse, high-quality inpaintings and synthesizing new content that is spatially, temporally, and semantically consistent with the provided context.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel artificial intelligence generation task termed Generated Contents Enrichment (GCE). Conventional AI content generation produces visually realistic content by implicitly enriching the given textual description based on limited semantic descriptions. Unlike this traditional task, our proposed GCE strives to perform content enrichment explicitly in both the visual and textual domains. The goal is to generate content that is visually realistic, structurally coherent, and semantically abundant. To tackle GCE, we propose a deep end-to-end adversarial method that explicitly explores semantics and inter-semantic relationships during the enrichment process. Our approach first models the input description as a scene graph, where nodes represent objects and edges capture inter-object relationships. We then adopt Graph Convolutional Networks on top of the input scene description to predict additional enriching objects and their relationships with the existing ones. Finally, the enriched description is passed to an image synthesis model to generate the corresponding visual content. Experiments conducted on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, producing promising and visually plausible results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinying Wang, Zhixiong Huang, Sifan Zhang, Jiawen Zhu, Paolo Gamba, Lin Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainstream approaches to spectral reconstruction (SR) primarily focus on designing Convolution- and Transformer-based architectures. However, CNN methods often face challenges in handling long-range dependencies, whereas Transformers are constrained by computational efficiency limitations. Recent breakthroughs in state-space model (e.g., Mamba) has attracted significant attention due to its near-linear computational efficiency and superior performance, prompting our investigation into its potential for SR problem. To this end, we propose the Gradient-guided Mamba for Spectral Reconstruction from RGB Images, dubbed GMSR-Net. GMSR-Net is a lightweight model characterized by a global receptive field and linear computational complexity. Its core comprises multiple stacked Gradient Mamba (GM) blocks, each featuring a tri-branch structure. In addition to benefiting from efficient global feature representation by Mamba block, we further innovatively introduce spatial gradient attention and spectral gradient attention to guide the reconstruction of spatial and spectral cues. GMSR-Net demonstrates a significant accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art performance while markedly reducing the number of parameters and computational burdens. Compared to existing approaches, GMSR-Net slashes parameters and FLOPS by substantial margins of 10 times and 20 times, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/wxy11-27/GMSR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Today's analog/mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuit (IC) designs demand substantial manual intervention. The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unveiled significant potential across various fields, suggesting their applicability in streamlining large-scale AMS IC design as well. A bottleneck in employing MLLMs for automatic AMS circuit generation is the absence of a comprehensive dataset delineating the schematic-netlist relationship. We therefore design an automatic technique for converting schematics into netlists, and create dataset AMSNet, encompassing transistor-level schematics and corresponding SPICE format netlists. With a growing size, AMSNet can significantly facilitate exploration of MLLM applications in AMS circuit design. We have made an initial set of netlists public, and will make both our netlist generation tool and the full dataset available upon publishing of this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have improved depth estimation in clear, daytime driving scenarios. However, existing methods struggle with rainy conditions due to rain streaks and fog, which distort depth estimation. This paper introduces a novel dual-layer convolutional kernel prediction network for lane depth estimation in rainy environments. It predicts two sets of kernels to mitigate depth loss and rain streak artifacts. To address the scarcity of real rainy lane data, an image synthesis algorithm, RCFLane, is presented, creating a synthetic dataset called RainKITTI. Experiments show the framework's effectiveness in complex rainy conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhong Zou, Xiangyu Zhu, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) seeks to enable Neural Networks to identify individual objects in visual scenes, which is crucial for interpretable visual comprehension and reasoning. Most existing OCL models adopt auto-encoding structures and learn to decompose visual scenes through specially designed inductive bias, which causes the model to miss small objects during reconstruction. Reverse hierarchy theory proposes that human vision corrects perception errors through a top-down visual pathway that returns to bottom-level neurons and acquires more detailed information, inspired by which we propose Reverse Hierarchy Guided Network (RHGNet) that introduces a top-down pathway that works in different ways in the training and inference processes. This pathway allows for guiding bottom-level features with top-level object representations during training, as well as encompassing information from bottom-level features into perception during inference. Our model achieves SOTA performance on several commonly used datasets including CLEVR, CLEVRTex and MOVi-C. We demonstrate with experiments that our method promotes the discovery of small objects and also generalizes well on complex real-world scenes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchen Li, Xiaokun Feng, Shiyu Hu, Meiqi Wu, Dailing Zhang, Jing Zhang, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances single object tracking (SOT) by integrating natural language descriptions from a video, for the precise tracking of a specified object. By leveraging high-level semantic information, VLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying on a visual modality. Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a single granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific guidance. Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations is laborious and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce DTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text to enhance environmental diversity. (1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and multi-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework. Its succinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various visual tracking benchmarks. (2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy our approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks, considering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing the practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and analyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance. Conclusionally, this work leverages LLM to provide multi-granularity semantic information for VLT task from efficient and diverse perspectives, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. In the future, we believe this work can be extended to more datasets to support vision datasets understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guotao Liang, Baoquan Zhang, Yaowei Wang, Xutao Li, Yunming Ye, Huaibin Wang, Chuyao Luo, Kola Ye, linfeng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key technique in high-resolution and high-fidelity image synthesis, which aims to learn a codebook to encode an image with a sequence of discrete codes and then generate an image in an auto-regression manner. Although existing methods have shown superior performance, most methods prefer to learn a single-modal codebook (\emph{e.g.}, image), resulting in suboptimal performance when the codebook is applied to multi-modal downstream tasks (\emph{e.g.}, text-to-image, image captioning) due to the existence of modal gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel language-guided codebook learning framework, called LG-VQ, which aims to learn a codebook that can be aligned with the text to improve the performance of multi-modal downstream tasks. Specifically, we first introduce pre-trained text semantics as prior knowledge, then design two novel alignment modules (\emph{i.e.}, Semantic Alignment Module, and Relationship Alignment Module) to transfer such prior knowledge into codes for achieving codebook text alignment. In particular, our LG-VQ method is model-agnostic, which can be easily integrated into existing VQ models. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance on reconstruction and various multi-modal downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yimeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Mingyi Hong, Ke Ding, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs' image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritam Sarkar, Sayna Ebrahimi, Ali Etemad, Ahmad Beirami, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their significant advancements, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate factually inaccurate information, referred to as hallucination. In this work, we address object hallucinations in MLLMs, where information is generated about an object not present in the input image. We introduce Data-augmented Phrase-level Alignment (DPA), a novel loss which can be applied to instruction-tuned off-the-shelf MLLMs to mitigate hallucinations, while preserving their general vision-language capabilities. To fine-tune MLLMs with DPA, we first generate a set of `hallucinated' and `correct' response pairs through generative data augmentation by selectively altering the ground-truth information of the correct responses at a phrase level. The DPA loss is then used to train MLLMs to reduce the likelihood of hallucinated phrases compared to the correct ones. Our thorough evaluation on various benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of DPA in mitigating hallucination while retaining the out-of-the-box performance of the MLLMs on general tasks. For instance, MLLMs finetuned with DPA, which we refer to as Hallucination Attenuated Language and Vision Assistant (HALVA), improve F1 by up to 13.4% on hallucination visual question-answering and reduce the hallucination rate by up to 4.2% on image description tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyun Lee, Zinan Lin, Giulia Fanti</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but sampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration of a generative ODE. One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows, which iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to truncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large number of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved techniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with \emph{knowledge distillation} methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main insight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow algorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight trajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations is unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of rectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber premetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous 2-rectified flow by up to 75\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet 64$\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art distillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive distillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance of improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzhou Yang, Yu Wang, Haijie Li, Jiarui Meng, Yanmin Wu, Xiandong Meng, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single image-to-3D generation is pivotal for crafting controllable 3D assets. Given its under-constrained nature, we attempt to leverage 3D geometric priors from a novel view diffusion model and 2D appearance priors from an image generation model to guide the optimization process. We note that there is a disparity between the generation priors of these two diffusion models, leading to their different appearance outputs. Specifically, image generation models tend to deliver more detailed visuals, whereas novel view models produce consistent yet over-smooth results across different views. Directly combining them leads to suboptimal effects due to their appearance conflicts. Hence, we propose a 2D-3D hybrid Fourier Score Distillation objective function, hy-FSD. It optimizes 3D Gaussians using 3D priors in spatial domain to ensure geometric consistency, while exploiting 2D priors in the frequency domain through Fourier transform for better visual quality. hy-FSD can be integrated into existing 3D generation methods and produce significant performance gains. With this technique, we further develop an image-to-3D generation pipeline to create high-quality 3D objects within one minute, named Fourier123. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fourier123 excels in efficient generation with rapid convergence speed and visually-friendly generation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengqiong Wu, Hao Fei, Xiangtai Li, Jiayi Ji, Hanwang Zhang, Tat-Seng Chua, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in processing vision-language tasks. One of the crux of MLLMs lies in vision tokenization, which involves efficiently transforming input visual signals into feature representations that are most beneficial for LLMs. However, existing vision tokenizers, essential for semantic alignment between vision and language, remain problematic. Existing methods aggressively fragment visual input, corrupting the visual semantic integrity. To address this, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Semantic-Equivalent Vision Tokenizer (SeTok), which groups visual features into semantic units via a dynamic clustering algorithm, flexibly determining the number of tokens based on image complexity. The resulting vision tokens effectively preserve semantic integrity and capture both low-frequency and high-frequency visual features. The proposed MLLM (Setokim) equipped with SeTok significantly demonstrates superior performance across various tasks, as evidenced by our experimental results.

<p>Abstract: Motion-based controllable video generation offers the potential for creating captivating visual content. Existing methods typically necessitate model training to encode particular motion cues or incorporate fine-tuning to inject certain motion patterns, resulting in limited flexibility and generalization.In this work, we propose MotionClone, a training-free framework that enables motion cloning from reference videos to versatile motion-controlled video generation, including text-to-video and image-to-video. Based on the observation that the dominant components in temporal-attention maps drive motion synthesis, while the rest mainly capture noisy or very subtle motions, MotionClone utilizes sparse temporal attention weights as motion representations for motion guidance, facilitating diverse motion transfer across varying scenarios. Meanwhile, MotionClone allows for the direct extraction of motion representation through a single denoising step, bypassing the cumbersome inversion processes and thus promoting both efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionClone exhibits proficiency in both global camera motion and local object motion, with notable superiority in terms of motion fidelity, textual alignment, and temporal consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Fang, Jiawei Kong, Wenbo Yu, Bin Chen, Jiawei Li, Shutao Xia, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have exhibited unprecedented capability in many applications by taking full advantage of the multimodal alignment. However, previous studies have shown they are vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial samples. Despite recent success, these methods are generally instance-specific and require generating perturbations for each input sample. In this paper, we reveal that VLP models are also vulnerable to the instance-agnostic universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). Specifically, we design a novel Contrastive-training Perturbation Generator with Cross-modal conditions (C-PGC) to achieve the attack. In light that the pivotal multimodal alignment is achieved through the advanced contrastive learning technique, we devise to turn this powerful weapon against themselves, i.e., employ a malicious version of contrastive learning to train the C-PGC based on our carefully crafted positive and negative image-text pairs for essentially destroying the alignment relationship learned by VLP models. Besides, C-PGC fully utilizes the characteristics of Vision-and-Language (V+L) scenarios by incorporating both unimodal and cross-modal information as effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that C-PGC successfully forces adversarial samples to move away from their original area in the VLP model's feature space, thus essentially enhancing attacks across various victim models and V+L tasks.

<p>Abstract: Virtual engines can generate dense depth maps for various synthetic scenes, making them invaluable for training depth estimation models. However, discrepancies between synthetic and real-world colors pose significant challenges for depth estimation in real-world scenes, especially in complex and uncertain environments encountered in unsupervised monocular depth estimation tasks. To address this issue, we propose Back2Color, a framework that predicts realistic colors from depth using a model trained on real-world data, thus transforming synthetic colors into their real-world counterparts. Additionally, we introduce the Syn-Real CutMix method for joint training with both real-world unsupervised and synthetic supervised depth samples, enhancing monocular depth estimation performance in real-world scenes. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of non-rigid motions on depth estimation, we present an auto-learning uncertainty temporal-spatial fusion method (Auto-UTSF), which leverages the strengths of unsupervised learning in both temporal and spatial dimensions. We also designed VADepth, based on the Vision Attention Network, which offers lower computational complexity and higher accuracy than transformers. Our Back2Color framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Kitti dataset, as evidenced by improvements in performance metrics and the production of fine-grained details. This is particularly evident on more challenging datasets such as Cityscapes for unsupervised depth estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyd Teymoor Seydi, Zavareh Bozorgasl, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification is a crucial but challenging task due to the high dimensionality and complex spatial-spectral correlations inherent in hyperspectral data. This paper employs Wavelet-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (wav-kan) architecture tailored for efficient modeling of these intricate dependencies. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Wav-KAN incorporates wavelet functions as learnable activation functions, enabling non-linear mapping of the input spectral signatures. The wavelet-based activation allows Wav-KAN to effectively capture multi-scale spatial and spectral patterns through dilations and translations. Experimental evaluation on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets (Salinas, Pavia, Indian Pines) demonstrates the superior performance of Wav-KAN compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and the recently proposed Spline-based KAN (Spline-KAN) model. In this work we are: (1) conducting more experiments on additional hyperspectral datasets (Pavia University, WHU-Hi, and Urban Hyperspectral Image) to further validate the generalizability of Wav-KAN; (2) developing a multiresolution Wav-KAN architecture to capture scale-invariant features; (3) analyzing the effect of dimensional reduction techniques on classification performance; (4) exploring optimization methods for tuning the hyperparameters of KAN models; and (5) comparing Wav-KAN with other state-of-the-art models in hyperspectral image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqin Huang, Haoyan Guan, Aofan Jiang, Ya Zhang, Michael Spratling, Xinchao Wang, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing anomaly detection (AD) methods require a dedicated model for each category. Such a paradigm, despite its promising results, is computationally expensive and inefficient, thereby failing to meet the requirements for realworld applications. Inspired by how humans detect anomalies, by comparing a query image to known normal ones, this article proposes a novel few-shot AD (FSAD) framework. Using a training set of normal images from various categories, registration, aiming to align normal images of the same categories, is leveraged as the proxy task for self-supervised category-agnostic representation learning. At test time, an image and its corresponding support set, consisting of a few normal images from the same category, are supplied, and anomalies are identified by comparing the registered features of the test image to its corresponding support image features. Such a setup enables the model to generalize to novel test categories. It is, to our best knowledge, the first FSAD method that requires no model fine-tuning for novel categories: enabling a single model to be applied to all categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, it improves the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for FSAD by 11.3% and 8.3% on the MVTec and MPDD benchmarks, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D assets created via reconstruction and generation have matched the quality of manually crafted assets, highlighting their potential for replacement. However, this potential is largely unrealized because these assets always need to be converted to meshes for 3D industry applications, and the meshes produced by current mesh extraction methods are significantly inferior to Artist-Created Meshes (AMs), i.e., meshes created by human artists. Specifically, current mesh extraction methods rely on dense faces and ignore geometric features, leading to inefficiencies, complicated post-processing, and lower representation quality. To address these issues, we introduce MeshAnything, a model that treats mesh extraction as a generation problem, producing AMs aligned with specified shapes. By converting 3D assets in any 3D representation into AMs, MeshAnything can be integrated with various 3D asset production methods, thereby enhancing their application across the 3D industry. The architecture of MeshAnything comprises a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer. We first learn a mesh vocabulary using the VQ-VAE, then train the shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer on this vocabulary for shape-conditioned autoregressive mesh generation. Our extensive experiments show that our method generates AMs with hundreds of times fewer faces, significantly improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies, while achieving precision comparable to previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are prone to hallucinations, where certain contextual cues in an image can trigger the language module to produce overconfident and incorrect reasoning about abnormal or hypothetical objects. While some benchmarks have been developed to investigate LVLM hallucinations, they often rely on hand-crafted corner cases whose failure patterns may not generalize well. Additionally, fine-tuning on these examples could undermine their validity. To address this, we aim to scale up the number of cases through an automated approach, reducing human bias in crafting such corner cases. This motivates the development of AutoHallusion, the first automated benchmark generation approach that employs several key strategies to create a diverse range of hallucination examples. Our generated visual-question pairs pose significant challenges to LVLMs, requiring them to overcome contextual biases and distractions to arrive at correct answers. AutoHallusion enables us to create new benchmarks at the minimum cost and thus overcomes the fragility of hand-crafted benchmarks. It also reveals common failure patterns and reasons, providing key insights to detect, avoid, or control hallucinations. Comprehensive evaluations of top-tier LVLMs, e.g., GPT-4V(ision), Gemini Pro Vision, Claude 3, and LLaVA-1.5, show a 97.7% and 98.7% success rate of hallucination induction on synthetic and real-world datasets of AutoHallusion, paving the way for a long battle against hallucinations.

<p>Abstract: Interleaved text-and-image generation has been an intriguing research direction, where the models are required to generate both images and text pieces in an arbitrary order. Despite the emerging advancements in interleaved generation, the progress in its evaluation still significantly lags behind. Existing evaluation benchmarks do not support arbitrarily interleaved images and text for both inputs and outputs, and they only cover a limited number of domains and use cases. Also, current works predominantly use similarity-based metrics which fall short in assessing the quality in open-ended scenarios. To this end, we introduce InterleavedBench, the first benchmark carefully curated for the evaluation of interleaved text-and-image generation. InterleavedBench features a rich array of tasks to cover diverse real-world use cases. In addition, we present InterleavedEval, a strong reference-free metric powered by GPT-4o to deliver accurate and explainable evaluation. We carefully define five essential evaluation aspects for InterleavedEval, including text quality, perceptual quality, image coherence, text-image coherence, and helpfulness, to ensure a comprehensive and fine-grained assessment. Through extensive experiments and rigorous human evaluation, we show that our benchmark and metric can effectively evaluate the existing models with a strong correlation with human judgments surpassing previous reference-based metrics. We also provide substantial findings and insights to foster future research in interleaved generation and its evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bei Yan, Jie Zhang, Zheng Yuan, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid progress and outstanding performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in recent years, LVLMs have been plagued by the issue of hallucination, i.e., LVLMs tend to generate responses that are inconsistent with the corresponding visual inputs. To evaluate the degree of hallucination in LVLMs, previous works have proposed a series of benchmarks featuring different types of tasks and evaluation metrics. However, we find that the quality of the existing hallucination benchmarks varies, with some suffering from problems, e.g., inconsistent evaluation results under repeated tests, and misalignment with human evaluation. To this end, we propose a Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework (HQM), which leverages various indicators to assess the reliability and validity of existing hallucination benchmarks separately. Specifically, for reliability we explore test-retest reliability and parallel-forms reliability, while for validity we examine criterion validity and coverage of hallucination types. Furthermore, based on the results of our quality measurement, we construct a High-Quality Hallucination Benchmark (HQH) for LVLMs, which demonstrates superior reliability and validity under our HQM framework. We conduct an extensive evaluation of over 10 representative LVLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, to provide an in-depth analysis of the hallucination issues in existing models. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/HQHBench/HQHBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilin Yan, Ouxiang Li, Jiayin Cai, Yanbin Hao, Xiaolong Jiang, Yao Hu, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of generative models, discerning AI-generated content has evoked increasing attention from both industry and academia. In this paper, we conduct a sanity check on "whether the task of AI-generated image detection has been solved". To start with, we present Chameleon dataset, consisting AIgenerated images that are genuinely challenging for human perception. To quantify the generalization of existing methods, we evaluate 9 off-the-shelf AI-generated image detectors on Chameleon dataset. Upon analysis, almost all models classify AI-generated images as real ones. Later, we propose AIDE (AI-generated Image DEtector with Hybrid Features), which leverages multiple experts to simultaneously extract visual artifacts and noise patterns. Specifically, to capture the high-level semantics, we utilize CLIP to compute the visual embedding. This effectively enables the model to discern AI-generated images based on semantics or contextual information; Secondly, we select the highest frequency patches and the lowest frequency patches in the image, and compute the low-level patchwise features, aiming to detect AI-generated images by low-level artifacts, for example, noise pattern, anti-aliasing, etc. While evaluating on existing benchmarks, for example, AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, AIDE achieves +3.5% and +4.6% improvements to state-of-the-art methods, and on our proposed challenging Chameleon benchmarks, it also achieves the promising results, despite this problem for detecting AI-generated images is far from being solved. The dataset, codes, and pre-train models will be published at https://github.com/shilinyan99/AIDE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thong Nguyen, Yi Bin, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Zhiyuan Hu, Khoi Le, Cong-Duy Nguyen, See-Kiong Ng, Luu Anh Tuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Data quality stands at the forefront of deciding the effectiveness of video-language representation learning. However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose MAMA, a new approach to learning video-language representations by utilizing a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, MAMA utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, MAMA improves video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.

<p>Abstract: Accurate perception of the dynamic environment is a fundamental task for autonomous driving and robot systems. This paper introduces Let Occ Flow, the first self-supervised work for joint 3D occupancy and occupancy flow prediction using only camera inputs, eliminating the need for 3D annotations. Utilizing TPV for unified scene representation and deformable attention layers for feature aggregation, our approach incorporates a novel attention-based temporal fusion module to capture dynamic object dependencies, followed by a 3D refine module for fine-gained volumetric representation. Besides, our method extends differentiable rendering to 3D volumetric flow fields, leveraging zero-shot 2D segmentation and optical flow cues for dynamic decomposition and motion optimization. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach over prior state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Yang, Weixiang Yan, Aishwarya Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite tremendous advancements, current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are still far from perfect. They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose Decompose and Compare Consistency (DeCC) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, DeCC measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show DeCC's reliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared to the existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantinos Panagiotis Alexandridis, Jiankang Deng, Anh Nguyen, Shan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The activation function plays a crucial role in model optimisation, yet the optimal choice remains unclear. For example, the Sigmoid activation is the de-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced classification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes. In this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both balanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the activation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in both balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Parametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function that unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can be applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS and balanced benchmarks such as ImageNet1K, COCO and V3DET.

<p>Abstract: This study extensively evaluated You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithms across all configurations (total 22) of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLO11 for green fruit detection in commercial orchards. The research also validated in-field fruitlet counting using an iPhone and machine vision sensors across four apple varieties: Scifresh, Scilate, Honeycrisp and Cosmic Crisp. Among the 22 configurations evaluated, YOLO11s and YOLOv9 gelan-base outperformed others with mAP@50 scores of 0.933 and 0.935 respectively. In terms of recall, YOLOv9 gelan-base achieved the highest value among YOLOv9 configurations at 0.899, while YOLO11m led YOLO11 variants with 0.897. YOLO11n emerged as the fastest model, achieving fastest inference speed of only 2.4 ms, significantly outpacing the leading configurations of YOLOv10n, YOLOv9 gelan-s, and YOLOv8n, with speeds of 5.5, 11.5, and 4.1 ms, respectively. This comparative evaluation highlights the strengths of YOLO11, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10, offering researchers essential insights to choose the best-suited model for fruitlet detection and possible automation in commercial orchards. For real-time automation related work in relevant datasets, we recommend using YOLO11n due to its high detection and image processing speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyang Ren, Bangyan Liao, Delei Kong, Jinghang Li, Peidong Liu, Laurent Kneip, Guillermo Gallego, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recovering the camera motion and scene geometry from visual data is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision. Its success in standard vision is attributed to the maturity of feature extraction, data association and multi-view geometry. The recent emergence of neuromorphic event-based cameras places great demands on approaches that use raw event data as input to solve this fundamental problem. Existing state-of-the-art solutions typically infer implicitly data association by iteratively reversing the event data generation process. However, the nonlinear nature of these methods limits their applicability in real-time tasks, and the constant-motion assumption leads to unstable results under agile motion. To this end, we rethink the problem formulation in a way that aligns better with the differential working principle of event cameras. We show that the event-based normal flow can be used, via the proposed geometric error term, as an alternative to the full flow in solving a family of geometric problems that involve instantaneous first-order kinematics and scene geometry. Furthermore, we develop a fast linear solver and a continuous-time nonlinear solver on top of the proposed geometric error term. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our linear solver in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and indicate its complementary feature as an initialization method for existing nonlinear solvers. Besides, our continuous-time non-linear solver exhibits exceptional capability in accommodating sudden variations in motion since it does not rely on the constant-motion assumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Yan, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) tasks require answering questions about images using extensive background knowledge. Despite significant advancements, generative models often struggle with these tasks due to the limited integration of external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce EchoSight, a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to answer visual questions requiring fine-grained encyclopedic knowledge. To strive for high-performing retrieval, EchoSight first searches wiki articles by using visual-only information, subsequently, these candidate articles are further reranked according to their relevance to the combined text-image query. This approach significantly improves the integration of multimodal knowledge, leading to enhanced retrieval outcomes and more accurate VQA responses. Our experimental results on the Encyclopedic VQA and InfoSeek datasets demonstrate that EchoSight establishes new state-of-the-art results in knowledge-based VQA, achieving an accuracy of 41.8% on Encyclopedic VQA and 31.3% on InfoSeek.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic classification of active tuberculosis from chest X-ray images has the potential to save lives, especially in low- and mid-income countries where skilled human experts can be scarce. Given the lack of available labeled data to train such systems and the unbalanced nature of publicly available datasets, we argue that the reliability of deep learning models is limited, even if they can be shown to obtain perfect classification accuracy on the test data. One way of evaluating the reliability of such systems is to ensure that models use the same regions of input images for predictions as medical experts would. In this paper, we show that pre-training a deep neural network on a large-scale proxy task, as well as using mixed objective optimization network (MOON), a technique to balance different classes during pre-training and fine-tuning, can improve the alignment of decision foundations between models and experts, as compared to a model directly trained on the target dataset. At the same time, these approaches keep perfect classification accuracy according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set, and improve generalization on an independent, unseen dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Liu, Xi Zhang, Haiyang Xu, Yaya Shi, Chaoya Jiang, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Weiming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Built on the power of LLMs, numerous multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various vision-language tasks. However, most existing MLLMs and benchmarks primarily focus on single-image input scenarios, leaving the performance of MLLMs when handling realistic multiple images underexplored. Although a few benchmarks consider multiple images, their evaluation dimensions and samples are very limited. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark MIBench, to comprehensively evaluate fine-grained abilities of MLLMs in multi-image scenarios. Specifically, MIBench categorizes the multi-image abilities into three scenarios: multi-image instruction (MII), multimodal knowledge-seeking (MKS) and multimodal in-context learning (MIC), and constructs 13 tasks with a total of 13K annotated samples. During data construction, for MII and MKS, we extract correct options from manual annotations and create challenging distractors to obtain multiple-choice questions. For MIC, to enable an in-depth evaluation, we set four sub-tasks and transform the original datasets into in-context learning formats. We evaluate several open-source and closed-source MLLMs on the proposed MIBench. The results reveal that although current models excel in single-image tasks, they exhibit significant shortcomings when faced with multi-image inputs, such as limited fine-grained perception, multi-image reasoning and in-context learning abilities. The annotated data of MIBench is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/StarBottle/MIBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have primarily leveraged diffusion models for short-duration content. However, these approaches often fall short in modeling complex narratives and maintaining character consistency over extended periods, which is essential for long-form video production like movies. We propose MovieDreamer, a novel hierarchical framework that integrates the strengths of autoregressive models with diffusion-based rendering to pioneer long-duration video generation with intricate plot progressions and high visual fidelity. Our approach utilizes autoregressive models for global narrative coherence, predicting sequences of visual tokens that are subsequently transformed into high-quality video frames through diffusion rendering. This method is akin to traditional movie production processes, where complex stories are factorized down into manageable scene capturing. Further, we employ a multimodal script that enriches scene descriptions with detailed character information and visual style, enhancing continuity and character identity across scenes. We present extensive experiments across various movie genres, demonstrating that our approach not only achieves superior visual and narrative quality but also effectively extends the duration of generated content significantly beyond current capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Zhang, Hu Zhang, Hang Yu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised 3D object detection aims to identify objects of interest from unlabeled raw data, such as LiDAR points. Recent approaches usually adopt pseudo 3D bounding boxes (3D bboxes) from clustering algorithm to initialize the model training. However, pseudo bboxes inevitably contain noise, and such inaccuracies accumulate to the final model, compromising the performance. Therefore, in an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of inaccurate pseudo bboxes, we introduce a new uncertainty-aware framework for unsupervised 3D object detection, dubbed UA3D. In particular, our method consists of two phases: uncertainty estimation and uncertainty regularization. (1) In the uncertainty estimation phase, we incorporate an extra auxiliary detection branch alongside the original primary detector. The prediction disparity between the primary and auxiliary detectors could reflect fine-grained uncertainty at the box coordinate level. (2) Based on the assessed uncertainty, we adaptively adjust the weight of every 3D bbox coordinate via uncertainty regularization, refining the training process on pseudo bboxes. For pseudo bbox coordinate with high uncertainty, we assign a relatively low loss weight. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed method is robust against the noisy pseudo bboxes, yielding substantial improvements on nuScenes and Lyft compared to existing approaches, with increases of +6.9% AP$_{BEV}$ and +2.5% AP$_{3D}$ on nuScenes, and +4.1% AP$_{BEV}$ and +2.0% AP$_{3D}$ on Lyft.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fushuo Huo, Wenchao Xu, Zhong Zhang, Haozhao Wang, Zhicheng Chen, Peilin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, the prevalent issue known as the `hallucination' problem has emerged as a significant bottleneck, hindering their real-world deployments. Existing methods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach leverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated datasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur additional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces hallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and mitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs. However, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and double the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical investigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the importance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both instruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after early layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during the auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge absorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless hallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified vision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully. Extensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and higher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much additional computation burdens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D generation have made significant progress.

In particular, with the pretrained diffusion models, existing methods predominantly use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to train 3D models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). However, a hurdle is that they often encounter difficulties with over-smoothing textures and over-saturating colors. The rectified flow model -- which utilizes a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) to represent a straight trajectory -- shows promise as an alternative prior to text-to-3D generation. It learns a time-independent vector field, thereby reducing the ambiguity in 3D model update gradients that are calculated using time-dependent scores in the SDS framework. In light of this, we first develop a mathematical analysis to seamlessly integrate SDS with rectified flow model, paving the way for our initial framework known as Vector Field Distillation Sampling (VFDS). However, empirical findings indicate that VFDS still results in over-smoothing outcomes. Therefore, we analyze the grounding reasons for such a failure from the perspective of ODE trajectories. On top, we propose a novel framework, named FlowDreamer, which yields high fidelity results with richer textual details and faster convergence. The key insight is to leverage the coupling and reversible properties of the rectified flow model to search for the corresponding noise, rather than using randomly sampled noise as in VFDS. Accordingly, we introduce a novel Unique Couple Matching (UCM) loss, which guides the 3D model to optimize along the same trajectory.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present CogVideoX, a large-scale text-to-video generation model based on diffusion transformer, which can generate 10-second continuous videos aligned with text prompt, with a frame rate of 16 fps and resolution of 768 * 1360 pixels. Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity. Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration, different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewon Kang, Divya Kothandaraman, Dinesh Manocha, Ming C. Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are limited to single-object-centric scenes and struggle with complex environments. They often require extensive 3D data for training, lacking generalization beyond the training distribution. Conversely, 3D-free methods can generate text-controlled views of complex, in-the-wild scenes using a pretrained stable diffusion model without the need for a large amount of 3D-based training data, but lack camera control. In this paper, we introduce a method capable of generating camera-controlled viewpoints from a single input image, by combining the benefits of 3D-free and 3D-based approaches. Our method excels in handling complex and diverse scenes without extensive training or additional 3D and multiview data. It leverages widely available pretrained NVS models for weak guidance, integrating this knowledge into a 3D-free view synthesis approach to achieve the desired results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, providing high-fidelity and consistent novel view synthesis at desired camera angles across a wide variety of scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinit Hegiste, Tatjana Legler, Martin Ruskowski</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of Federated Learning (FL), particularly within the manufacturing sector, the strategy for selecting client weights for server aggregation is pivotal for model performance. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of two weight selection strategies: Final Epoch Weight Selection (FEWS) and Optimal Epoch Weight Selection (OEWS). Designed for manufacturing contexts where collaboration typically involves a limited number of partners (two to four clients), our research focuses on federated image classification tasks. We employ various neural network architectures, including EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG, to assess the impact of these weight selection strategies on model convergence and robustness. Our research aims to determine whether FEWS or OEWS enhances the global FL model's performance across communication rounds (CRs). Through empirical analysis and rigorous experimentation, we seek to provide valuable insights for optimizing FL implementations in manufacturing, ensuring that collaborative efforts yield the most effective and reliable models with a limited number of participating clients. The findings from this study are expected to refine FL practices significantly in manufacturing, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of collaborative machine learning endeavors in this vital sector.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Liu, Chen Jia, Fan Shi, Xu Cheng, Mianzhao Wang, Shengyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting cracks with pixel-level precision for key structures is a significant challenge, as existing methods struggle to effectively integrate local textures and pixel dependencies of cracks. Furthermore, these methods often possess numerous parameters and substantial computational requirements, complicating deployment on edge control devices. In this paper, we propose a staircase cascaded fusion crack segmentation network (CrackSCF) that generates high-quality crack segmentation maps using minimal computational resources. We constructed a staircase cascaded fusion module that effectively captures local patterns of cracks and long-range dependencies of pixels, and it can suppress background noise well. To reduce the computational resources required by the model, we introduced a lightweight convolution block, which replaces all convolution operations in the network, significantly reducing the required computation and parameters without affecting the network's performance. To evaluate our method, we created a challenging benchmark dataset called TUT and conducted experiments on this dataset and five other public datasets. The experimental results indicate that our method offers significant advantages over existing methods, especially in handling background noise interference and detailed crack segmentation. The F1 and mIoU scores on the TUT dataset are 0.8382 and 0.8473, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring the least computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Yang, Yuan Dong, Hanwen Jiang, Dejia Xu, Georgios Pavlakos, Qixing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Using the latent diffusion model has proven effective in developing novel 3D generation techniques. To harness the latent diffusion model, a key challenge is designing a high-fidelity and efficient representation that links the latent space and the 3D space. In this paper, we introduce Atlas Gaussians, a novel representation for feed-forward native 3D generation. Atlas Gaussians represent a shape as the union of local patches, and each patch can decode 3D Gaussians. We parameterize a patch as a sequence of feature vectors and design a learnable function to decode 3D Gaussians from the feature vectors. In this process, we incorporate UV-based sampling, enabling the generation of a sufficiently large, and theoretically infinite, number of 3D Gaussian points. The large amount of 3D Gaussians enables the generation of high-quality details. Moreover, due to local awareness of the representation, the transformer-based decoding procedure operates on a patch level, ensuring efficiency. We train a variational autoencoder to learn the Atlas Gaussians representation, and then apply a latent diffusion model on its latent space for learning 3D Generation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the prior arts of feed-forward native 3D generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-MoD, a novel framework designed to enable the efficient training of small-scale Multimodal Language Models (s-MLLM) by distilling knowledge from large-scale MLLM (l-MLLM). Our approach tackles two fundamental challenges in MLLM distillation. First, we optimize the network structure of s-MLLM by integrating a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture into the language model, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Second, we propose a progressive knowledge transfer strategy to ensure comprehensive knowledge migration. This strategy begins with mimic distillation, where we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between output distributions to enable the student model to emulate the teacher network's understanding. Following this, we introduce preference distillation via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where the key lies in treating l-MLLM as the reference model. During this phase, the s-MLLM's ability to discriminate between superior and inferior examples is significantly enhanced beyond l-MLLM, leading to a better student that surpasses its teacher, particularly in hallucination benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-MoD outperforms existing models across various multimodal benchmarks while maintaining a minimal number of activated parameters and low computational costs. Remarkably, LLaVA-MoD, with only 2B activated parameters, surpasses Qwen-VL-Chat-7B by an average of 8.8% across benchmarks, using merely 0.3% of the training data and 23% trainable parameters. These results underscore LLaVA-MoD's ability to effectively distill comprehensive knowledge from its teacher model, paving the way for the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code will be available on: https://github.com/shufangxun/LLaVA-MoD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Li, Shuojue Yang, Daiyun Shen, Yueming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing endoscopic videos is crucial for high-fidelity visualization and the efficiency of surgical operations. Despite the importance, existing 3D reconstruction methods encounter several challenges, including stringent demands for accuracy, imprecise camera positioning, intricate dynamic scenes, and the necessity for rapid reconstruction. Addressing these issues, this paper presents the first camera-pose-free scene reconstruction framework, Free-DyGS, tailored for dynamic surgical videos, leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting technology. Our approach employs a frame-by-frame reconstruction strategy and is delineated into four distinct phases: Scene Initialization, Joint Learning, Scene Expansion, and Retrospective Learning. We introduce a Generalizable Gaussians Parameterization module within the Scene Initialization and Expansion phases to proficiently generate Gaussian attributes for each pixel from the RGBD frames. The Joint Learning phase is crafted to concurrently deduce scene deformation and camera pose, facilitated by an innovative flexible deformation module. In the scene expansion stage, the Gaussian points gradually grow as the camera moves. The Retrospective Learning phase is dedicated to enhancing the precision of scene deformation through the reassessment of prior frames. The efficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through experiments on two datasets: the StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets. The experimental outcomes underscore that Free-DyGS surpasses conventional baseline models in both rendering fidelity and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfeng Diao, Baiqi Wu, Ruixuan Zhang, Ajian Liu, Xingxing Wei, Meng Wang, He Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeletal sequences, as well-structured representations of human behaviors, play a vital role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR. To this end, we propose the first \textbf{T}ransfer-based \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{S}keletal \textbf{A}ction \textbf{R}ecognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothed model posterior without requiring surrogate re-training, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike previous transfer-based attacks that treat each frame independently and overlook temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack gradient, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. To exhaustively evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods and our method, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense methods. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christiaan Viviers, Amaan Valiuddin, Francisco Caetano, Lemar Abdi, Lena Filatova, Peter de With, Fons van der Sommen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) sensory data and covariate distribution shift aims to identify new test examples with different high-level image statistics to the captured, normal and In-Distribution (ID) set. Existing OOD detection literature largely focuses on semantic shift with little-to-no consensus over covariate shift. Generative models capture the ID data in an unsupervised manner, enabling them to effectively identify samples that deviate significantly from this learned distribution, irrespective of the downstream task. In this work, we elucidate the ability of generative models to detect and quantify domain-specific covariate shift through extensive analyses that involves a variety of models. To this end, we conjecture that it is sufficient to detect most occurring sensory faults (anomalies and deviations in global signals statistics) by solely modeling high-frequency signal-dependent and independent details. We propose a novel method, CovariateFlow, for OOD detection, specifically tailored to covariate heteroscedastic high-frequency image-components using conditional Normalizing Flows (cNFs). Our results on CIFAR10 vs. CIFAR10-C and ImageNet200 vs. ImageNet200-C demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by accurately detecting OOD covariate shift. This work contributes to enhancing the fidelity of imaging systems and aiding machine learning models in OOD detection in the presence of covariate shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Sun, Jiale Cao, Jin Xie, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Yanwei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stable diffusion has demonstrated strong image synthesis ability to given text descriptions, suggesting it to contain strong semantic clue for grouping objects. The researchers have explored employing stable diffusion for training-free segmentation. Most existing approaches refine cross-attention map by self-attention map once, demonstrating that self-attention map contains useful semantic information to improve segmentation. To fully utilize self-attention map, we present a deep experimental analysis on iteratively refining cross-attention map with self-attention map, and propose an effective iterative refinement framework for training-free segmentation, named iSeg. The proposed iSeg introduces an entropy-reduced self-attention module that utilizes a gradient descent scheme to reduce the entropy of self-attention map, thereby suppressing the weak responses corresponding to irrelevant global information. Leveraging the entropy-reduced self-attention module, our iSeg stably improves refined cross-attention map with iterative refinement. Further, we design a category-enhanced cross-attention module to generate accurate cross-attention map, providing a better initial input for iterative refinement. Extensive experiments across different datasets and diverse segmentation tasks reveal the merits of proposed contributions, leading to promising performance on diverse segmentation tasks. For unsupervised semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, our iSeg achieves an absolute gain of 3.8% in terms of mIoU compared to the best existing training-free approach in literature. Moreover, our proposed iSeg can support segmentation with different kinds of images and interactions. The project is available at https://linsun449.github.io/iSeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Hsi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of drone technology has made accurate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection essential for surveillance, security, and airspace management. This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate UAVDB's potential as a critical resource for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Wang, Shang Zhao, Zikang Xu, S Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation is instrumental to minimally invasive surgeries and related applications. Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Chen, Shujian Zhang, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning community is increasingly recognizing the importance of fostering trust and safety in modern generative AI (GenAI) models. We posit machine unlearning (MU) as a crucial foundation for developing safe, secure, and trustworthy GenAI models. Traditional MU methods often rely on stringent assumptions and require access to real data. This paper introduces Score Forgetting Distillation (SFD), an innovative MU approach that promotes the forgetting of undesirable information in diffusion models by aligning the conditional scores of "unsafe" classes or concepts with those of "safe" ones. To eliminate the need for real data, our SFD framework incorporates a score-based MU loss into the score distillation objective of a pretrained diffusion model. This serves as a regularization term that preserves desired generation capabilities while enabling the production of synthetic data through a one-step generator. Our experiments on pretrained label-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method effectively accelerates the forgetting of target classes or concepts during generation, while preserving the quality of other classes or concepts. This unlearned and distilled diffusion not only pioneers a novel concept in MU but also accelerates the generation speed of diffusion models. Our experiments and studies on a range of diffusion models and datasets confirm that our approach is generalizable, effective, and advantageous for MU in diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Xun, Siyuan Liang, Xiaojun Jia, Xinwei Liu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large models for multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, have been widely recognized in the industry as highly susceptible to data-poisoned backdoor attacks. This poses significant risks to downstream model training. In response to such potential threats, finetuning offers a simpler and more efficient defense choice compared to retraining large models with augmented data. In the supervised learning domain, fine-tuning defense strategies can achieve excellent defense performance. However, in the unsupervised and semi-supervised domain, we find that when CLIP faces some complex attack techniques, the existing fine-tuning defense strategy, CleanCLIP, has some limitations on defense performance. The synonym substitution of its text-augmentation is insufficient to enhance the text feature space. To compensate for this weakness, we improve it by proposing a fine-grained \textbf{T}ext \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{C}leaner (TA-Cleaner) to cut off feature connections of backdoor triggers. We randomly select a few samples for positive and negative subtext generation at each epoch of CleanCLIP, and align the subtexts to the images to strengthen the text self-supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our TA-Cleaner against six attack algorithms and conduct comprehensive zero-shot classification tests on ImageNet1K. Our experimental results demonstrate that TA-Cleaner achieves state-of-the-art defensiveness among finetuning-based defense techniques. Even when faced with the novel attack technique BadCLIP, our TA-Cleaner outperforms CleanCLIP by reducing the ASR of Top-1 and Top-10 by 52.02\% and 63.88\%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end relightable neural inverse rendering system that achieves high-quality reconstruction of geometry and material properties, thus enabling high-quality relighting. The cornerstone of our method is a two-stage approach for learning a better factorization of scene parameters. In the first stage, we develop a reflection-aware radiance field using a neural signed distance field (SDF) as the geometry representation and deploy an MLP (multilayer perceptron) to estimate indirect illumination. In the second stage, we introduce a novel information-sharing network structure to jointly learn the radiance field and the physically based factorization of the scene. For the physically based factorization, to reduce the noise caused by Monte Carlo sampling, we apply a split-sum approximation with a simplified Disney BRDF and cube mipmap as the environment light representation. In the relighting phase, to enhance the quality of indirect illumination, we propose a second split-sum algorithm to trace secondary rays under the split-sum rendering framework.Furthermore, there is no dataset or protocol available to quantitatively evaluate the inverse rendering performance for glossy objects. To assess the quality of material reconstruction and relighting, we have created a new dataset with ground truth BRDF parameters and relighting results. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in inverse rendering and relighting, with particularly strong results in the reconstruction of highly reflective objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeff Tan, Donglai Xiang, Shubham Tulsiani, Deva Ramanan, Gengshan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct time-consistent human body models from monocular videos, focusing on extremely loose clothing or handheld object interactions. Prior work in human reconstruction is either limited to tight clothing with no object interactions, or requires calibrated multi-view captures or personalized template scans which are costly to collect at scale. Our key insight for high-quality yet flexible reconstruction is the careful combination of generic human priors about articulated body shape (learned from large-scale training data) with video-specific articulated "bag-of-bones" deformation (fit to a single video via test-time optimization). We accomplish this by learning a neural implicit model that disentangles body versus clothing deformations as separate motion model layers. To capture subtle geometry of clothing, we leverage image-based priors such as human body pose, surface normals, and optical flow during optimization. The resulting neural fields can be extracted into time-consistent meshes, or further optimized as explicit 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity interactive rendering. On datasets with highly challenging clothing deformations and object interactions, DressRecon yields higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions than prior art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chieh-Yun Chen, Chiang Tseng, Li-Wu Tsao, Hong-Han Shuai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of causal manner in the text encoder of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which can lead to information bias and loss. Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 90.05% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yazhou Zhu, Minxian Li, Qiaolin Ye, Shidong Wang, Tong Xin, Haofeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) aims to perform the limited annotated data learning in the medical image analysis scope. Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on three scenarios (i.e., cross-modal, cross-sequence and cross-institution), which includes eight medical datasets and involves three body regions, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves the SoTA performance against the compared models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Wang, Yantai Yang, Shuaiyu Zhang, Chenghao Sun, Weiya Li, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset reduction (DR) seeks to select or distill samples from large datasets into smaller subsets while preserving performance on target tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on pruning or synthesizing data in the same format as the original dataset, typically the input data and corresponding labels. However, in DR settings, we find it is possible to synthesize more information beyond the data-label pair as an additional learning target to facilitate model training. In this paper, we introduce Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information (DRUPI), which enriches DR by synthesizing privileged information alongside the reduced dataset. This privileged information can take the form of feature labels or attention labels, providing auxiliary supervision to improve model learning. Our findings reveal that effective feature labels must balance between being overly discriminative and excessively diverse, with a moderate level proving optimal for improving the reduced dataset's efficacy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that DRUPI integrates seamlessly with existing dataset reduction methods, offering significant performance gains. *The code will be released after the paper is accepted.*</p>

<p>Abstract: Ophthalmology relies heavily on detailed image analysis for diagnosis and treatment planning. While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown promise in understanding complex visual information, their performance on ophthalmology images remains underexplored. We introduce LMOD, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating LVLMs on ophthalmology images, covering anatomical understanding, diagnostic analysis, and demographic extraction. LMODincludes 21,993 images spanning optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, eye photos, surgical scenes, and color fundus photographs. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art LVLMs and find that they are far from perfect for comprehending ophthalmology images. Models struggle with diagnostic analysis and demographic extraction, reveal weaknesses in spatial reasoning, diagnostic analysis, handling out-of-domain queries, and safeguards for handling biomarkers of ophthalmology images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Mai, Peter Hedman, George Kopanas, Dor Verbin, David Futschik, Qiangeng Xu, Falko Kuester, Jonathan T. Barron, Yinda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchun Chen, Jian Wang, Yinda Zhang, Rohit Pandey, Thabo Beeler, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt</p>
<p>Abstract: Immersive VR telepresence ideally means being able to interact and communicate with digital avatars that are indistinguishable from and precisely reflect the behaviour of their real counterparts. The core technical challenge is two fold: Creating a digital double that faithfully reflects the real human and tracking the real human solely from egocentric sensing devices that are lightweight and have a low energy consumption, e.g. a single RGB camera. Up to date, no unified solution to this problem exists as recent works solely focus on egocentric motion capture, only model the head, or build avatars from multi-view captures. In this work, we, for the first time in literature, propose a person-specific egocentric telepresence approach, which jointly models the photoreal digital avatar while also driving it from a single egocentric video. We first present a character model that is animatible, i.e. can be solely driven by skeletal motion, while being capable of modeling geometry and appearance. Then, we introduce a personalized egocentric motion capture component, which recovers full-body motion from an egocentric video. Finally, we apply the recovered pose to our character model and perform a test-time mesh refinement such that the geometry faithfully projects onto the egocentric view. To validate our design choices, we propose a new and challenging benchmark, which provides paired egocentric and dense multi-view videos of real humans performing various motions. Our experiments demonstrate a clear step towards egocentric and photoreal telepresence as our method outperforms baselines as well as competing methods. For more details, code, and data, we refer to our project page.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a scarcity of multilingual vision-language models that properly account for the perceptual differences that are reflected in image captions across languages and cultures. In this work, through a multimodal, multilingual retrieval case study, we quantify the existing lack of model flexibility. We empirically show performance gaps between training on captions that come from native German perception and captions that have been either machine-translated or human-translated from English into German. To address these gaps, we further propose and evaluate caption augmentation strategies. While we achieve mean recall improvements (+1.3), gaps still remain, indicating an open area of future work for the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuchen Li, Shiyu Hu, Xiaokun Feng, Dailing Zhang, Meiqi Wu, Jing Zhang, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual language tracking (VLT) has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, harnessing linguistic data to enhance algorithms with multi-modal inputs and broadening the scope of traditional single object tracking (SOT) to encompass video understanding applications. Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still depend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video. These descriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content dynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform level of detail and a fixed annotation frequency. As a result, algorithms tend to default to a "memorize the answer" strategy, diverging from the core objective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content. Fortunately, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of diverse text. This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations (in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks, thereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark. Specifically, we (1) propose a new visual language tracking benchmark with diverse texts, named DTVLT, based on five prominent VLT and SOT benchmarks, including three sub-tasks: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. (2) We offer four granularity texts in our benchmark, considering the extent and density of semantic information. We expect this multi-granular generation strategy to foster a favorable environment for VLT and video understanding research. (3) We conduct comprehensive experimental analyses on DTVLT, evaluating the impact of diverse text on tracking performance and hope the identified performance bottlenecks of existing algorithms can support further research in VLT and video understanding. The proposed benchmark, experimental results and toolkit will be released gradually on http://videocube.aitestunion.com/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exceled in novel view synthesis with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However, it faces challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To address this issue, we propose Super-Resolution 3DGS (SuperGS), which is an expansion of 3DGS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework, utilizing pretrained low-resolution scene representation as an initialization for super-resolution optimization. Moreover, we introduce Multi-resolution Feature Gaussian Splatting (MFGS) to incorporates a latent feature field for flexible feature sampling and Gradient-guided Selective Splitting (GSS) for effective Gaussian upsampling. By integrating these strategies within the coarse-to-fine framework ensure both high fidelity and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS surpasses state-of-the-art HRNVS methods on challenging real-world datasets using only low-resolution inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Senkang Hu, Hangcheng Cao, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Jiang, Zimo He, Zi Wang, Hongjie Li, Yixin Chen, Siyuan Huang, Yixin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthesizing human motions in 3D environments, particularly those with complex activities such as locomotion, hand-reaching, and human-object interaction, presents substantial demands for user-defined waypoints and stage transitions. These requirements pose challenges for current models, leading to a notable gap in automating the animation of characters from simple human inputs. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a comprehensive framework for synthesizing multi-stage scene-aware interaction motions directly from a single text instruction and goal location. Our approach employs an auto-regressive diffusion model to synthesize the next motion segment, along with an autonomous scheduler predicting the transition for each action stage. To ensure that the synthesized motions are seamlessly integrated within the environment, we propose a scene representation that considers the local perception both at the start and the goal location. We further enhance the coherence of the generated motion by integrating frame embeddings with language input. Additionally, to support model training, we present a comprehensive motion-captured dataset comprising 16 hours of motion sequences in 120 indoor scenes covering 40 types of motions, each annotated with precise language descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating high-quality, multi-stage motions closely aligned with environmental and textual conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for image generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To address this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions during generation. Specifically, we introduce a Timestep-wise Dynamic Width (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a Spatial-wise Dynamic Token (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. Extensive experiments on various datasets and different-sized models verify the superiority of DyDiT. Notably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our method reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, accelerates generation by 1.73, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meenakshi Subhash Chippa, Prakash Chandra Chhipa, Kanjar De, Marcus Liwicki, Rajkumar Saini</p>
<p>Abstract: Perspective distortion (PD) leads to substantial alterations in the shape, size, orientation, angles, and spatial relationships of visual elements in images. Accurately determining camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is challenging, making it hard to synthesize perspective distortion effectively. The current distortion correction methods involve removing distortion and learning vision tasks, thus making it a multi-step process, often compromising performance. Recent work leverages the M\"obius transform for mitigating perspective distortions (MPD) to synthesize perspective distortions without estimating camera parameters. M\"obius transform requires tuning multiple interdependent and interrelated parameters and involving complex arithmetic operations, leading to substantial computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Log Conformal Maps (LCM), a method leveraging the logarithmic function to approximate perspective distortions with fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity. We provide a detailed foundation complemented with experiments to demonstrate that LCM with fewer parameters approximates the MPD. We show that LCM integrates well with supervised and self-supervised representation learning, outperform standard models, and matches the state-of-the-art performance in mitigating perspective distortion over multiple benchmarks, namely Imagenet-PD, Imagenet-E, and Imagenet-X. Further LCM demonstrate seamless integration with person re-identification and improved the performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Lichen Bai, Haoyi Xiong, Zeke Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The multi-step sampling mechanism, a key feature of visual diffusion models, has significant potential to replicate the success of OpenAI's Strawberry in enhancing performance by increasing the inference computational cost. Sufficient prior studies have demonstrated that correctly scaling up computation in the sampling process can successfully lead to improved generation quality, enhanced image editing, and compositional generalization. While there have been rapid advancements in developing inference-heavy algorithms for improved image generation, relatively little work has explored inference scaling laws in video diffusion models (VDMs). Furthermore, existing research shows only minimal performance gains that are perceptible to the naked eye. To address this, we design a novel training-free algorithm IV-Mixed Sampler that leverages the strengths of image diffusion models (IDMs) to assist VDMs surpass their current capabilities. The core of IV-Mixed Sampler is to use IDMs to significantly enhance the quality of each video frame and VDMs ensure the temporal coherence of the video during the sampling process. Our experiments have demonstrated that IV-Mixed Sampler achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks including UCF-101-FVD, MSR-VTT-FVD, Chronomagic-Bench-150, and Chronomagic-Bench-1649. For example, the open-source Animatediff with IV-Mixed Sampler reduces the UMT-FVD score from 275.2 to 228.6, closing to 223.1 from the closed-source Pika-2.0.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized visual content creation, but extending these capabilities to text-to-video (T2V) generation remains a challenge, particularly in preserving temporal consistency. Existing methods that aim to improve consistency often cause trade-offs such as reduced imaging quality and impractical computational time. To address these issues we introduce VideoGuide, a novel framework that enhances the temporal consistency of pretrained T2V models without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Instead, VideoGuide leverages any pretrained video diffusion model (VDM) or itself as a guide during the early stages of inference, improving temporal quality by interpolating the guiding model's denoised samples into the sampling model's denoising process. The proposed method brings about significant improvement in temporal consistency and image fidelity, providing a cost-effective and practical solution that synergizes the strengths of various video diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate prior distillation, revealing that base models can achieve enhanced text coherence by utilizing the superior data prior of the guiding model through the proposed method.

<p>Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually consume a significant amount of computational overhead, despite their sparser information density compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens and require additional training data. Differently, we propose an efficient training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM without extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Concretely, given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLMs for linguistic reasoning, we select visual-relevant text tokens to rate the significance of vision tokens within the self-attention matrix extracted from the VLMs. Then we progressively prune irrelevant tokens. To maximize sparsity while retaining essential information, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that our SparseVLM improves the efficiency of various VLMs across a range of image and video understanding tasks. In particular, LLaVA equipped with SparseVLM reduces 61% to 67% FLOPs with a compression ratio of 78% while maintaining 93% of the accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a crucial problem for cancer diagnostics in clinics and hospitals. A WSI, acquired at gigapixel size, is commonly tiled into patches and processed by multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Previous MIL-based models designed for this problem have only been evaluated on individual tasks for specific organs, and the ability to handle multiple tasks within a single model has not been investigated. In this study, we propose MECFormer, a generative Transformer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks within one model. To leverage the power of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and to enhance the model's effectiveness in focusing on each individual task, we introduce an Expert Consultation Network, a projection layer placed at the beginning of the Transformer-based model. Additionally, to enable flexible classification, autoregressive decoding is incorporated by a language decoder for WSI classification. Through extensive experiments on five datasets involving four different organs, one cancer classification task, and four cancer subtyping tasks, MECFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to individual state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, there have been explorations of generalist segmentation models that can effectively tackle a variety of image segmentation tasks within a unified in-context learning framework. However, these methods still struggle with task ambiguity in in-context segmentation, as not all in-context examples can accurately convey the task information. In order to address this issue, we present SINE, a simple image Segmentation framework utilizing in-context examples. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder provides high-quality image representations, and the decoder is designed to yield multiple task-specific output masks to effectively eliminate task ambiguity. Specifically, we introduce an In-context Interaction module to complement in-context information and produce correlations between the target image and the in-context example and a Matching Transformer that uses fixed matching and a Hungarian algorithm to eliminate differences between different tasks. In addition, we have further perfected the current evaluation system for in-context image segmentation, aiming to facilitate a holistic appraisal of these models. Experiments on various segmentation tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pasquale De Marinis, Gennaro Vessio, Giovanna Castellano</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on effective weed management to ensure robust crop yields. This study presents RoWeeder, an innovative framework for unsupervised weed mapping that combines crop-row detection with a noise-resilient deep learning model. By leveraging crop-row information to create a pseudo-ground truth, our method trains a lightweight deep learning model capable of distinguishing between crops and weeds, even in the presence of noisy data. Evaluated on the WeedMap dataset, RoWeeder achieves an F1 score of 75.3, outperforming several baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further validated the model's performance. By integrating RoWeeder with drone technology, farmers can conduct real-time aerial surveys, enabling precise weed management across large fields.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiang Qiu, Hongyao Yu, Hao Fang, Wenbo Yu, Bin Chen, Xuan Wang, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim at leveraging the output information of target models to reconstruct privacy-sensitive training data, raising widespread concerns on privacy threats of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Unfortunately, in tandem with the rapid evolution of MI attacks, the lack of a comprehensive, aligned, and reliable benchmark has emerged as a formidable challenge. This deficiency leads to inadequate comparisons between different attack methods and inconsistent experimental setups. In this paper, we introduce the first practical benchmark for model inversion attacks and defenses to address this critical gap, which is named \textit{MIBench}. This benchmark serves as an extensible and reproducible modular-based toolbox and currently integrates a total of 16 state-of-the-art attack and defense methods. Moreover, we furnish a suite of assessment tools encompassing 9 commonly used evaluation protocols to facilitate standardized and fair evaluation and analysis. Capitalizing on this foundation, we conduct extensive experiments from multiple perspectives to holistically compare and analyze the performance of various methods across different scenarios, which overcomes the misalignment issues and discrepancy prevalent in previous works. Based on the collected attack methods and defense strategies, we analyze the impact of target resolution, defense robustness, model predictive power, model architectures, transferability and loss function. Our hope is that this \textit{MIBench} could provide a unified, practical and extensible toolbox and is widely utilized by researchers in the field to rigorously test and compare their novel methods, ensuring equitable evaluations and thereby propelling further advancements in the future development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ge Ya Luo, Gian Mario Favero, Zhi Hao Luo, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: The Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) is a widely adopted metric for evaluating video generation distribution quality. However, its effectiveness relies on critical assumptions. Our analysis reveals three significant limitations: (1) the non-Gaussianity of the Inflated 3D Convnet (I3D) feature space; (2) the insensitivity of I3D features to temporal distortions; (3) the impractical sample sizes required for reliable estimation. These findings undermine FVD's reliability and show that FVD falls short as a standalone metric for video generation evaluation. After extensive analysis of a wide range of metrics and backbone architectures, we propose JEDi, the JEPA Embedding Distance, based on features derived from a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, measured using Maximum Mean Discrepancy with polynomial kernel. Our experiments on multiple open-source datasets show clear evidence that it is a superior alternative to the widely used FVD metric, requiring only 16% of the samples to reach its steady value, while increasing alignment with human evaluation by 34%, on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabin Adhikari, Safal Thapaliya, Manish Dhakal, Bishesh Khanal</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive performance in vision tasks, but adapting them to new domains often requires expensive fine-tuning. Prompt tuning techniques, including textual, visual, and multimodal prompting, offer efficient alternatives by leveraging learnable prompts. However, their application to Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) and evaluation under significant domain shifts remain unexplored. This work presents an open-source benchmarking framework, TuneVLSeg, to integrate various unimodal and multimodal prompt tuning techniques into VLSMs, making prompt tuning usable for downstream segmentation datasets with any number of classes. TuneVLSeg includes $6$ prompt tuning strategies on various prompt depths used in $2$ VLSMs totaling of $8$ different combinations. We test various prompt tuning on $8$ diverse medical datasets, including $3$ radiology datasets (breast tumor, echocardiograph, chest X-ray pathologies) and $5$ non-radiology datasets (polyp, ulcer, skin cancer), and two natural domain segmentation datasets. Our study found that textual prompt tuning struggles under significant domain shifts, from natural-domain images to medical data. Furthermore, visual prompt tuning, with fewer hyperparameters than multimodal prompt tuning, often achieves performance competitive to multimodal approaches, making it a valuable first attempt. Our work advances the understanding and applicability of different prompt-tuning techniques for robust domain-specific segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wu, Kecheng Zheng, Shuailei Ma, Fan Lu, Yuxin Guo, Yifei Zhang, Wei Chen, Qingpei Guo, Yujun Shen, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models. In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens. Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with long captions, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (e.g., in the image classification task). Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (i.e., from 72.62% to 83.72%). We will release the code, the model, and the new dataset to facilitate the reproducibility and further research. The project page is available at https://wuw2019.github.io/lot-lip.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Rui, Xiangyong Cao, Jun Shu, Qian Zhao, Deyu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: For hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising task, the causes of noise embeded in an HSI are typically complex and uncontrollable. Thus, it remains a challenge for model-based HSI denoising methods to handle complex noise. To enhance the noise-handling capabilities of existing model-based methods, we resort to design a general weighted data fidelity term. The weight in this term is used to assess the noise intensity and thus elementwisely adjust the contribution of the observed noisy HSI in a denoising model. The similar concept of "weighting" has been hinted in several methods. Due to the unknown nature of the noise distribution, the implementation of "weighting" in these works are usually achieved via empirical formula for specific denoising method. In this work, we propose to predict the weight by a hyper-weight network (i.e., HWnet). The HWnet is learned exactly from several model-based HSI denoising methods in a bi-level optimization framework based on the data-driven methodology. For a noisy HSI, the learned HWnet outputs its corresponding weight. Then the weighted data fidelity term implemented with the predicted weight can be explicitly combined with a target model-based HSI denoising method. In this way, our HWnet achieves the goal of enhancing the noise adaptation ability of model-based HSI denoising methods for different noisy HSIs. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed HWnet can effecitvely help to improve the ability of an HSI denoising model to handle different complex noises. This further implies that our HWnet could transfer the noise knowledge at the model level and we also study the corresponding generalization theory for simple illustration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takahiro Maeda, Keisuke Takeshita, Norimichi Ukita, Kazuhito Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: For physical human-robot interactions (pHRI), a robot needs to estimate the accurate body pose of a target person. However, in these pHRI scenarios, the robot cannot fully observe the target person's body with equipped cameras because the target person must be close to the robot for physical interaction. This close distance leads to severe truncation and occlusions and thus results in poor accuracy of human pose estimation. For better accuracy in this challenging environment, we propose an active measurement and sensor fusion framework of the equipped cameras with touch and ranging sensors such as 2D LiDAR. Touch and ranging sensor measurements are sparse but reliable and informative cues for localizing human body parts. In our active measurement process, camera viewpoints and sensor placements are dynamically optimized to measure body parts with higher estimation uncertainty, which is closely related to truncation or occlusion. In our sensor fusion process, assuming that the measurements of touch and ranging sensors are more reliable than the camera-based estimations, we fuse the sensor measurements to the camera-based estimated pose by aligning the estimated pose towards the measured points. Our proposed method outperformed previous methods on the standard occlusion benchmark with simulated active measurement. Furthermore, our method reliably estimated human poses using a real robot, even with practical constraints such as occlusion by blankets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Xiaodan Li, Cen Chen, Wenmeng Zhou, Yaliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: A prevailing belief in attack and defense community is that the higher flatness of adversarial examples enables their better cross-model transferability, leading to a growing interest in employing sharpness-aware minimization and its variants. However, the theoretical relationship between the transferability of adversarial examples and their flatness has not been well established, making the belief questionable. To bridge this gap, we embark on a theoretical investigation and, for the first time, derive a theoretical bound for the transferability of adversarial examples with few practical assumptions. Our analysis challenges this belief by demonstrating that the increased flatness of adversarial examples does not necessarily guarantee improved transferability. Moreover, building upon the theoretical analysis, we propose TPA, a Theoretically Provable Attack that optimizes a surrogate of the derived bound to craft adversarial examples. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmark datasets and various real-world applications show that TPA can craft more transferable adversarial examples compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We hope that these results can recalibrate preconceived impressions within the community and facilitate the development of stronger adversarial attack and defense mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zecheng Hao, Xinyu Shi, Yujia Liu, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has garnered widespread academic interest for its intrinsic ability to transmit information in a more energy-efficient manner. However, despite previous efforts to optimize the learning algorithm of SNNs through various methods, SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of performance. The recently proposed multi-threshold model provides more possibilities for further enhancing the learning capability of SNNs. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the relationship among the multi-threshold model, vanilla spiking model and quantized ANNs from a mathematical perspective, then propose a novel LM-HT model, which is an equidistant multi-threshold model that can dynamically regulate the global input current and membrane potential leakage on the time dimension. The LM-HT model can also be transformed into a vanilla single threshold model through reparameterization, thereby achieving more flexible hardware deployment. In addition, we note that the LM-HT model can seamlessly integrate with ANN-SNN Conversion framework under special initialization. This novel hybrid learning framework can effectively improve the relatively poor performance of converted SNNs under low time latency. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our model can outperform previous state-of-the-art works on various types of datasets, which promote SNNs to achieve a brand-new level of performance comparable to quantized ANNs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Radl, Michael Steiner, Mathias Parger, Alexander Weinrauch, Bernhard Kerbl, Markus Steinberger</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent model for constructing 3D representations from images across diverse domains. However, the efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications. Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies, as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering performance is nearly doubled, making our approach 1.6x faster than the original Gaussian Splatting, with a 50% reduction in memory requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran He, Chenjia Bai, Ling Pan, Weinan Zhang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning a generalist embodied agent capable of completing multiple tasks poses challenges, primarily stemming from the scarcity of action-labeled robotic datasets. In contrast, a vast amount of human videos exist, capturing intricate tasks and interactions with the physical world. Promising prospects arise for utilizing actionless human videos for pre-training and transferring the knowledge to facilitate robot policy learning through limited robot demonstrations. However, it remains a challenge due to the domain gap between humans and robots. Moreover, it is difficult to extract useful information representing the dynamic world from human videos, because of its noisy and multimodal data structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to tackle these challenges, which leverages a unified discrete diffusion to combine generative pre-training on human videos and policy fine-tuning on a small number of action-labeled robot videos. We start by compressing both human and robot videos into unified video tokens. In the pre-training stage, we employ a discrete diffusion model with a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to predict future video tokens in the latent space. In the fine-tuning stage, we harness the imagined future videos to guide low-level action learning with a limited set of robot data. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-fidelity future videos for planning and enhances the fine-tuned policies compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches with superior performance.

<p>Abstract: We introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information (geometry and semantics) and high-level information (action-conditioned relationships between different entities) in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects, and deformable objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipei Zhang, Yanqi Cheng, Lihao Liu, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved brain tumour segmentation techniques; however, the results still lack confidence and robustness as they solely consider image data without biophysical priors or pathological information. Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models as a regularisation with deep learning, operational with any network model. Our method introduces tumour growth PDE models directly into the segmentation process, improving accuracy and robustness, especially in data-scarce scenarios. This system estimates tumour cell density using a periodic activation function. By effectively integrating this estimation with biophysical models, we achieve better capture of tumour characteristics. This approach not only aligns the segmentation closer to actual biological behaviour but also strengthens the model's performance under limited data conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the BraTS 2023 dataset, showcasing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of tumour segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikang Liu, Kun Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Dawei Gao, Yaliang Li, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning is the key to building large vision language models~(LVLMs), which can greatly improve the task generalization and solving capabilities by learning a mixture of instruction data from diverse visual tasks. Previous work mostly collects multiple existing visual instruction datasets via heuristic ways for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy and enlarge the training cost. To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of instructions from several tasks even do not affect the performance. Based on the findings, we propose a high-value data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within the visual instruction data and reduce the training cost. In TIVE, we first estimate the instance influence score on its corresponding task, and the task difficulty score, based on the gradient-based influence functions. Then, we leverage the two kinds of scores to determine the task proportion within the selected visual instruction subset, and select high-value instances for each task, respectively. Experiments on various LVLMs show that our approach using only about 15% data can achieve comparable average performance to the full-data fine-tuned model across eight benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks. Our code and data will be publicly released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Topological accuracy in medical image segmentation is a highly important property for downstream applications such as network analysis and flow modeling in vessels or cell counting. Recently, significant methodological advancements have brought well-founded concepts from algebraic topology to binary segmentation. However, these approaches have been underexplored in multi-class segmentation scenarios, where topological errors are common. We propose a general loss function for topologically faithful multi-class segmentation extending the recent Betti matching concept, which is based on induced matchings of persistence barcodes. We project the N-class segmentation problem to N single-class segmentation tasks, which allows us to use 1-parameter persistent homology, making training of neural networks computationally feasible. We validate our method on a comprehensive set of four medical datasets with highly variant topological characteristics. Our loss formulation significantly enhances topological correctness in cardiac, cell, artery-vein, and Circle of Willis segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

<p>Abstract: Incorporating diffusion models in the image compression domain has the potential to produce realistic and detailed reconstructions, especially at extremely low bitrates. Previous methods focus on using diffusion models as expressive decoders robust to quantization errors in the conditioning signals, yet achieving competitive results in this manner requires costly training of the diffusion model and long inference times due to the iterative generative process. In this work we formulate the removal of quantization error as a denoising task, using diffusion to recover lost information in the transmitted image latent. Our approach allows us to perform less than 10% of the full diffusion generative process and requires no architectural changes to the diffusion model, enabling the use of foundation models as a strong prior without additional fine tuning of the backbone. Our proposed codec outperforms previous methods in quantitative realism metrics, and we verify that our reconstructions are qualitatively preferred by end users, even when other methods use twice the bitrate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinzhu Jin, Matthew B. Dwyer, P. Thomas Fletcher</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new technique to measure the feature dependency of neural network models. The motivation is to better understand a model by querying whether it is using information from human-understandable features, e.g., anatomical shape, volume, or image texture. Our method is based on the principle that if a model is dependent on a feature, then removal of that feature should significantly harm its performance. A targeted feature is "removed" by collapsing the dimension in the data distribution that corresponds to that feature. We perform this by moving data points along the feature dimension to a baseline feature value while staying on the data manifold, as estimated by a deep generative model. Then we observe how the model's performance changes on the modified test data set, with the target feature dimension removed. We test our method on deep neural network models trained on synthetic image data with known ground truth, an Alzheimer's disease prediction task using MRI and hippocampus segmentations from the OASIS-3 dataset, and a cell nuclei classification task using the Lizard dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuexiang Zhai, Hao Bai, Zipeng Lin, Jiayi Pan, Shengbang Tong, Yifei Zhou, Alane Suhr, Saining Xie, Yann LeCun, Yi Ma, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) fine-tuned on specialized visual instruction-following data have exhibited impressive language reasoning capabilities across various scenarios. However, this fine-tuning paradigm may not be able to efficiently learn optimal decision-making agents in multi-step goal-directed tasks from interactive environments. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then prompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM to efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final text-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an executable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task rewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire VLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling 7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini. Furthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial component for performance improvement, as removing the CoT reasoning results in a significant decrease in the overall performance of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaotian Weng, Zijun Gao, Jerone Andrews, Jieyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is making AI-driven scientific assistants increasingly feasible, with interpreting scientific figures being a crucial task. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus mainly on basic charts and limited science subjects, lacking comprehensive evaluations. To address this, we curated a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from peer-reviewed, open-access Nature Communications articles, spanning 72 scientific disciplines. This dataset includes figures such as schematic diagrams, simulated images, macroscopic/microscopic photos, and experimental visualizations (e.g., western blots), which often require graduate-level, discipline-specific expertise to interpret. We developed benchmarks for scientific figure captioning and multiple-choice questions, evaluating six proprietary and over ten open-source models across varied settings. The results highlight the high difficulty of these tasks and the significant performance gap among models. While many open-source models performed at chance level on the multiple-choice task, some matched the performance of proprietary models. However, the gap was more pronounced in the captioning task. Our dataset also provide valuable resource for training. Fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL-2B model with our task-specific multimodal training data improved its multiple-choice accuracy to a level comparable to GPT-4o, though captioning remains challenging. Continuous pre-training of MLLMs using our interleaved article and figure data enhanced their material generation capabilities, demonstrating potential for integrating scientific knowledge. The dataset and benchmarks will be released to support further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Shridhar, Yat Long Lo, Stephen James</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-generation diffusion models have been fine-tuned to unlock new capabilities such as image-editing and novel view synthesis. Can we similarly unlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, a behavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions' as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method is also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth, keypoints, or motion-planners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai-liang Lu, Yu-meng Su, Zhuo Bi, Cheng Qiu, Wen-jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and traditional numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations (DEs) through literature investigation and experimental validation. We focused on the soft-constrained PINN approach and formalized its mathematical framework and computational flow for solving Ordinary DEs and Partial DEs (ODEs/PDEs). The working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. We demonstrate that the DeepXDE-based implementation of PINN is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across CPU/GPU platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a few unsupervised collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. We also find that, with the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain of the training set, and especially is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN can easily impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance to ODEs that obey this physical law. Furthermore, PINN can also be used for stiff ODEs, PDEs, and other types of DEs, and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atrin Arya, Sana Ayromlou, Armin Saadat, Purang Abolmaesumi, Xiaoxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard deep learning-based classification approaches may not always be practical in real-world clinical applications, as they require a centralized collection of all samples. Federated learning (FL) provides a paradigm that can learn from distributed datasets across clients without requiring them to share data, which can help mitigate privacy and data ownership issues. In FL, sub-optimal convergence caused by data heterogeneity is common among data from different health centers due to the variety in data collection protocols and patient demographics across centers. Through experimentation in this study, we show that data heterogeneity leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting during local training. We propose FedImpres which alleviates catastrophic forgetting by restoring synthetic data that represents the global information as federated impression. To achieve this, we distill the global model resulting from each communication round. Subsequently, we use the synthetic data alongside the local data to enhance the generalization of local training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the BloodMNIST and Retina datasets, which contain label imbalance and domain shift, with an improvement in classification accuracy of up to 20%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabia Asghar, Arslan Shaukat, Usman Akram, Rimsha Tariq</p>
<p>Abstract: Human immune system contains white blood cells (WBC) that are good indicator of many diseases like bacterial infections, AIDS, cancer, spleen, etc. White blood cells have been sub classified into four types: monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils on the basis of their nucleus, shape and cytoplasm. Traditionally in laboratories, pathologists and hematologists analyze these blood cells through microscope and then classify them manually. This manual process takes more time and increases the chance of human error. Hence, there is a need to automate this process. In this paper, first we have used different CNN pre-train models such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16 and MobileNetV2 to automatically classify the white blood cells. These pre-train models are applied on Kaggle dataset of microscopic images. Although we achieved reasonable accuracy ranging between 92 to 95%, still there is need to enhance the performance. Hence, inspired by these architectures, a framework has been proposed to automatically categorize the four kinds of white blood cells with increased accuracy. The aim is to develop a convolution neural network (CNN) based classification system with decent generalization ability. The proposed CNN model has been tested on white blood cells images from Kaggle and LISC datasets. Accuracy achieved is 99.57% and 98.67% for both datasets respectively. Our proposed convolutional neural network-based model provides competitive performance as compared to previous results reported in literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Xu, Bowen Hai, Yushun Tang, Zhihai He</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) models have achieved superior rate-distortion performance than traditional codecs. Existing LIC models use CNN, Transformer, or Mixed CNN-Transformer as basic blocks. However, limited by the shifted window attention, Swin-Transformer-based LIC exhibits a restricted growth of receptive fields, affecting the ability to model large objects for image compression. To address this issue and improve the performance, we incorporate window partition into channel attention for the first time to obtain large receptive fields and capture more global information. Since channel attention hinders local information learning, it is important to extend existing attention mechanisms in Transformer codecs to the space-channel attention to establish multiple receptive fields, being able to capture global correlations with large receptive fields while maintaining detailed characterization of local correlations with small receptive fields. We also incorporate the discrete wavelet transform into our Spatial-Channel Hybrid (SCH) framework for efficient frequency-dependent down-sampling and further enlarging receptive fields. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances, reducing BD-rate by 18.54%, 23.98%, 22.33%, and 24.71% on four standard datasets compared to VTM-23.1.</p>

Our method, a state-of-the-art factor graph optimization pipeline, extends Structure from Small Motion (SfSM) to robustly initialize a monocular agent in spacecraft inspection trajectories, addressing visual estimation challenges such as weak-perspective projection and center-pointing motion, which exacerbates the bas-relief ambiguity, dominant planar geometry, which causes motion estimation degeneracies in classical Structure from Motion, and dynamic illumination conditions, which reduce the survivability of visual information. We validate our approach on realistic, simulated satellite inspection image sequences with a tumbling spacecraft and demonstrate the method's effectiveness over existing monocular initialization procedures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent works have focused on source-free UDA, where only target data is available. This is challenging as models rely on noisy pseudo-labels and struggle with distribution shifts. We propose Active Adversarial Alignment (A3), a novel framework combining self-supervised learning, adversarial training, and active learning for robust source-free UDA. A3 actively samples informative and diverse data using an acquisition function for training. It adapts models via adversarial losses and consistency regularization, aligning distributions without source data access. A3 advances source-free UDA through its synergistic integration of active and adversarial learning for effective domain alignment and noise reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Chen, Xingjun Ma, Difan Zou, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization of training data has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this direction aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to training data memorization than unconditional DPMs, and the motivated data extraction methods are mostly for conditional DPMs. However, these understandings are primarily empirical, and extracting training data from unconditional models has been found to be extremely challenging. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs under the assumption of model convergence. Our theoretical analysis indicates that extracting data from unconditional models can also be effective by constructing a proper surrogate condition. Based on this result, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on the generated data as a surrogate condition to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our SIDE can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gurucharan Marthi Krishna Kumar, Janine Mendola, Amir Shmuel</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration is crucial for aligning medical images in a non-linear fashion across different modalities, allowing for precise spatial correspondence between varying anatomical structures. This paper presents NestedMorph, a novel network utilizing a Nested Attention Fusion approach to improve intra-subject deformable registration between T1-weighted (T1w) MRI and diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. NestedMorph integrates high-resolution spatial details from an encoder with semantic information from a decoder using a multi-scale framework, enhancing both local and global feature extraction. Our model notably outperforms existing methods, including CNN-based approaches like VoxelMorph, MIDIR, and CycleMorph, as well as Transformer-based models such as TransMorph and ViT-V-Net, and traditional techniques like NiftyReg and SyN. Evaluations on the HCP dataset demonstrate that NestedMorph achieves superior performance across key metrics, including SSIM, HD95, and SDlogJ, with the highest SSIM of 0.89, and the lowest HD95 of 2.5 and SDlogJ of 0.22. These results highlight NestedMorph's ability to capture both local and global image features effectively, leading to superior registration performance. The promising outcomes of this study underscore NestedMorph's potential to significantly advance deformable medical image registration, providing a robust framework for future research and clinical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki Nezakati, Md Kaykobad Reza, Ameya Patil, Mashhour Solh, M. Salman Asif</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning seeks to combine data from multiple input sources to enhance the performance of different downstream tasks. In real-world scenarios, performance can degrade substantially if some input modalities are missing. Existing methods that can handle missing modalities involve custom training or adaptation steps for each input modality combination. These approaches are either tied to specific modalities or become computationally expensive as the number of input modalities increases. In this paper, we propose Masked Modality Projection (MMP), a method designed to train a single model that is robust to any missing modality scenario. We achieve this by randomly masking a subset of modalities during training and learning to project available input modalities to estimate the tokens for the masked modalities. This approach enables the model to effectively learn to leverage the information from the available modalities to compensate for the missing ones, enhancing missing modality robustness. We conduct a series of experiments with various baseline models and datasets to assess the effectiveness of this strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves robustness to different missing modality scenarios, outperforming existing methods designed for missing modalities or specific modality combinations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Gamified Adversarial Prompting (GAP), a framework that crowd-sources high-quality data for visual instruction tuning of large multimodal models. GAP transforms the data collection process into an engaging game, incentivizing players to provide fine-grained, challenging questions and answers that target gaps in the model's knowledge. Our contributions include (1) an approach to capture question-answer pairs from humans that directly address weaknesses in a model's knowledge, (2) a method for evaluating and rewarding players that successfully incentivizes them to provide high-quality submissions, and (3) a scalable, gamified platform that succeeds in collecting this data from over 50,000 participants in just a few weeks. Our implementation of GAP has significantly improved the accuracy of a small multimodal model, namely MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5-8B, increasing its GPT score from 0.147 to 0.477 on our dataset, approaching the benchmark set by the much larger GPT-4V. Moreover, we demonstrate that the data generated using MiniCPM-Llama3-V-2.5-8B also enhances its performance across other benchmarks, and exhibits cross-model benefits. Specifically, the same data improves the performance of QWEN2-VL-2B and QWEN2-VL-7B on the same multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Haocheng Yin, Heng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification, we investigate whether a similar law of clustering emerges in the visual representation space. Since image-based control is a regression task without explicitly defined classes, the central piece of the puzzle lies in determining according to what implicit classes the visual features cluster, if such a law exists. Focusing on image-based planar pushing, we posit the most important role of the visual representation in a control task is to convey a goal to the action decoder. We then classify training samples of expert demonstrations into eight "control-oriented" classes based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output, where one class corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO). Across four different instantiations of architecture, we report the prevalent emergence of control-oriented clustering in the visual representation space according to the eight REPOs. Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35% in the low-data regime. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p>
