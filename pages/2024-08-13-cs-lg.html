<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshansh Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to predicting mechanical properties of Additive Friction Stir Deposited (AFSD) aluminum alloy walled structures using biomimetic machine learning. The research combines numerical modeling of the AFSD process with genetic algorithm-optimized machine learning models to predict von Mises stress and logarithmic strain. Finite element analysis was employed to simulate the AFSD process for five aluminum alloys: AA2024, AA5083, AA5086, AA7075, and AA6061, capturing complex thermal and mechanical interactions. A dataset of 200 samples was generated from these simulations. Subsequently, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) regression models, optimized using genetic algorithms, were developed to predict key mechanical properties. The GA-RF model demonstrated superior performance in predicting both von Mises stress (R square = 0.9676) and logarithmic strain (R square = 0.7201). This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing the AFSD process across multiple aluminum alloys, offering insights into material behavior under various process parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixuan Yu, Xirui Tang, Feiyang Li, Zinan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores an improved Adaboost algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), which aims to improve the prediction accuracy of user clicks on web page advertisements. By comparing it with several common machine learning algorithms, the paper analyses the advantages of the new model in ad click prediction. It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which is an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other three base models. This significant improvement indicates that the algorithm is more capable of capturing user behavioural characteristics and time series patterns. In addition, this paper evaluates the model's performance on other performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the improved Adaboost algorithm based on LSTM is significantly ahead of the traditional model in all these metrics, which further validates its effectiveness and superiority. Especially when facing complex and dynamically changing user behaviours, the model is able to better adapt and make accurate predictions. In order to ensure the practicality and reliability of the model, this study also focuses on the accuracy difference between the training set and the test set. After validation, the accuracy of the proposed model on these two datasets only differs by 1.7%, which is a small difference indicating that the model has good generalisation ability and can be effectively applied to real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Wu, Kourosh Hakhamaneshi, Yuqing Du, Igor Mordatch, Aravind Rajeswaran, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: One-shot Imitation Learning~(OSIL) aims to imbue AI agents with the ability to learn a new task from a single demonstration. To supervise the learning, OSIL typically requires a prohibitively large number of paired expert demonstrations -- i.e. trajectories corresponding to different variations of the same semantic task. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the semi-supervised OSIL problem setting, where the learning agent is presented with a large dataset of trajectories with no task labels (i.e. an unpaired dataset), along with a small dataset of multiple demonstrations per semantic task (i.e. a paired dataset). This presents a more realistic and practical embodiment of few-shot learning and requires the agent to effectively leverage weak supervision from a large dataset of trajectories. Subsequently, we develop an algorithm specifically applicable to this semi-supervised OSIL setting. Our approach first learns an embedding space where different tasks cluster uniquely. We utilize this embedding space and the clustering it supports to self-generate pairings between trajectories in the large unpaired dataset. Through empirical results on simulated control tasks, we demonstrate that OSIL models trained on such self-generated pairings are competitive with OSIL models trained with ground-truth labels, presenting a major advancement in the label-efficiency of OSIL.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05288">The impact of internal variability on benchmarking deep learning climate emulators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn L\"utjens, Raffaele Ferrari, Duncan Watson-Parris, Noelle Selin</p>
<p>Abstract: Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We implement a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and find that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved surface-level climate variables. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. We identify that this outcome is a result of high levels of internal variability in the benchmark targets. To address internal variability, we update the benchmark targets with ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model that contain 50 instead of 3 climate simulations per emission pathway. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based model for emulating precipitation. We publish our code, data, and an interactive tutorial at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05314">rule4ml: An Open-Source Tool for Resource Utilization and Latency Estimation for ML Models on FPGA</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mehdi Rahimifar, Hamza Ezzaoui Rahali, Audrey C. Therrien</p>
<p>Abstract: Implementing Machine Learning (ML) models on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is becoming increasingly popular across various domains as a low-latency and low-power solution that helps manage large data rates generated by continuously improving detectors. However, developing ML models for FPGAs is time-consuming, as optimization requires synthesis to evaluate FPGA area and latency, making the process slow and repetitive. This paper introduces a novel method to predict the resource utilization and inference latency of Neural Networks (NNs) before their synthesis and implementation on FPGA. We leverage HLS4ML, a tool-flow that helps translate NNs into high-level synthesis (HLS) code, to synthesize a diverse dataset of NN architectures and train resource utilization and inference latency predictors. While HLS4ML requires full synthesis to obtain resource and latency insights, our method uses trained regression models for immediate pre-synthesis predictions. The prediction models estimate the usage of Block RAM (BRAM), Digital Signal Processors (DSP), Flip-Flops (FF), and Look-Up Tables (LUT), as well as the inference clock cycles. The predictors were evaluated on both synthetic and existing benchmark architectures and demonstrated high accuracy with R2 scores ranging between 0.8 and 0.98 on the validation set and sMAPE values between 10% and 30%. Overall, our approach provides valuable preliminary insights, enabling users to quickly assess the feasibility and efficiency of NNs on FPGAs, accelerating the development and deployment processes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghazal Ghajari, Mithun Kumar PK, Fathi Amsaad</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is a promising technique for identifying unusual patterns in data without the need for labeled training examples. This approach is particularly valuable for early case detection in epidemic management, especially when early-stage data are scarce. This research introduces a novel hybrid method for anomaly detection that combines distance and density measures, enhancing its applicability across various infectious diseases. Our method is especially relevant in pandemic situations, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, where traditional supervised classification methods fall short due to limited data. The efficacy of our method is evaluated using COVID-19 chest X-ray data, where it significantly outperforms established unsupervised techniques. It achieves an average AUC of 77.43%, surpassing the AUC of Isolation Forest at 73.66% and KNN at 52.93%. These results highlight the potential of our hybrid anomaly detection method to improve early detection capabilities in diverse epidemic scenarios, thereby facilitating more effective and timely responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Acciarini, Francesco Biscani, Dario Izzo</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of spaceflight mechanics and astrodynamics, determining eclipse regions is a frequent and critical challenge. This determination impacts various factors, including the acceleration induced by solar radiation pressure, the spacecraft power input, and its thermal state all of which must be accounted for in various phases of the mission design. This study leverages recent advances in neural image processing to develop fully differentiable models of eclipse regions for highly irregular celestial bodies. By utilizing test cases involving Solar System bodies previously visited by spacecraft, such as 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 101955 Bennu, we propose and study an implicit neural architecture defining the shape of the eclipse cone based on the Sun's direction. Employing periodic activation functions, we achieve high precision in modeling eclipse conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of these differentiable models in spaceflight mechanics computations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Lenhat, Viet Anh Nguyen, Khoa Nguyen, Duong Duc Hieu, Dao Huu Hung, Truong Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: The versatility of self-attention mechanism earned transformers great success in almost all data modalities, with limitations on the quadratic complexity and difficulty of training. Efficient transformers, on the other hand, often rely on clever data-modality-dependent construction to get over the quadratic complexity of transformers. This greatly hinders their applications on different data modalities, which is one of the pillars of contemporary foundational modeling. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for efficient foundational modeling by proposing SAMSA - SAMpling-Self-Attention, a context-aware linear complexity self-attention mechanism that works well on multiple data modalities. Our mechanism is based on a differentiable sampling without replacement method we discovered. This enables the self-attention module to attend to the most important token set, where the importance is defined by data. Moreover, as differentiability is not needed in inference, the sparse formulation of our method costs little time overhead, further lowering computational costs. In short, SAMSA achieved competitive or even SOTA results on many benchmarks, while being faster in inference, compared to other very specialized models. Against full self-attention, real inference time significantly decreases while performance ranges from negligible degradation to outperformance. We release our source code in the repository: https://github.com/HySonLab/SAMSA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tangjun Wang, Chenglong Bao, Zuoqiang Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework, called Interface Laplace learning, for graph-based semi-supervised learning. Motivated by the observation that an interface should exist between different classes where the function value is non-smooth, we introduce a Laplace learning model that incorporates an interface term. This model challenges the long-standing assumption that functions are smooth at all unlabeled points. In the proposed approach, we add an interface term to the Laplace learning model at the interface positions. We provide a practical algorithm to approximate the interface positions using k-hop neighborhood indices, and to learn the interface term from labeled data without artificial design. Our method is efficient and effective, and we present extensive experiments demonstrating that Interface Laplace learning achieves better performance than other recent semi-supervised learning approaches at extremely low label rates on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amanda A. Volk, Robert W. Epps, Jeffrey G. Ethier, Luke A. Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents the use of graph learning for the prediction of multi-step experimental outcomes for applications across experimental research, including material science, chemistry, and biology. The viability of geometric learning for regression tasks was benchmarked against a collection of linear models through a combination of simulated and real-world data training studies. First, a selection of five arbitrarily designed multi-step surrogate functions were developed to reflect various features commonly found within experimental processes. A graph transformer network outperformed all tested linear models in scenarios that featured hidden interactions between process steps and sequence dependent features, while retaining equivalent performance in sequence agnostic scenarios. Then, a similar comparison was applied to real-world literature data on algorithm guided colloidal atomic layer deposition. Using the complete reaction sequence as training data, the graph neural network outperformed all linear models in predicting the three spectral properties for most training set sizes. Further implementation of graph neural networks and geometric representation of scientific processes for the prediction of experiment outcomes could lead to algorithm driven navigation of higher dimension parameter spaces and efficient exploration of more dynamic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anpeng Wu, Kun Kuang, Ruoxuan Xiong, Xiangwei Chen, Zexu Sun, Fei Wu, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In causal inference, encouragement designs (EDs) are widely used to analyze causal effects, when randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are impractical or compliance to treatment cannot be perfectly enforced. Unlike RCTs, which directly allocate treatments, EDs randomly assign encouragement policies that positively motivate individuals to engage in a specific treatment. These random encouragements act as instrumental variables (IVs), facilitating the identification of causal effects through leveraging exogenous perturbations in discrete treatment scenarios. However, real-world applications of encouragement designs often face challenges such as incomplete randomization, limited experimental data, and significantly fewer encouragements compared to treatments, hindering precise causal effect estimation. To address this, this paper introduces novel theories and algorithms for identifying the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using variations in encouragement. Further, by leveraging both observational and encouragement data, we propose a generalized IV estimator, named Encouragement-based Counterfactual Regression (EnCounteR), to effectively estimate the causal effects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of EnCounteR over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Gao, Michael Cooper, Maryam Naghibzadeh, Amirhossein Azhie, Mamatha Bhat, Rahul G. Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Liver allograft failure occurs in approximately 20% of liver transplant recipients within five years post-transplant, leading to mortality or the need for retransplantation. Providing an accurate and interpretable model for individualized risk estimation of graft failure is essential for improving post-transplant care. To this end, we introduce the Model for Allograft Survival (MAS), a simple linear risk score that outperforms other advanced survival models. Using longitudinal patient follow-up data from the United States (U.S.), we develop our models on 82,959 liver transplant recipients and conduct multi-site evaluations on 11 regions. Additionally, by testing on a separate non-U.S. cohort, we explore the out-of-distribution generalization performance of various models without additional fine-tuning, a crucial property for clinical deployment. We find that the most complex models are also the ones most vulnerable to distribution shifts despite achieving the best in-distribution performance. Our findings not only provide a strong risk score for predicting long-term graft failure but also suggest that the routine machine learning pipeline with only in-distribution held-out validation could create harmful consequences for patients at deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaarel H\"anni, Jake Mendel, Dmitry Vaintrob, Lawrence Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Superposition -- when a neural network represents more ``features'' than it has dimensions -- seems to pose a serious challenge to mechanistically interpreting current AI systems. Existing theory work studies \emph{representational} superposition, where superposition is only used when passing information through bottlenecks. In this work, we present mathematical models of \emph{computation} in superposition, where superposition is actively helpful for efficiently accomplishing the task.
  We first construct a task of efficiently emulating a circuit that takes the AND of the $\binom{m}{2}$ pairs of each of $m$ features. We construct a 1-layer MLP that uses superposition to perform this task up to $\varepsilon$-error, where the network only requires $\tilde{O}(m^{\frac{2}{3}})$ neurons, even when the input features are \emph{themselves in superposition}. We generalize this construction to arbitrary sparse boolean circuits of low depth, and then construct ``error correction'' layers that allow deep fully-connected networks of width $d$ to emulate circuits of width $\tilde{O}(d^{1.5})$ and \emph{any} polynomial depth. We conclude by providing some potential applications of our work for interpreting neural networks that implement computation in superposition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Operational numerical weather prediction systems consist of three fundamental components: the global observing system for data collection, data assimilation for generating initial conditions, and the forecasting model to predict future weather conditions. While NWP have undergone a quiet revolution, with forecast skills progressively improving over the past few decades, their advancement has slowed due to challenges such as high computational costs and the complexities associated with assimilating an increasing volume of observational data and managing finer spatial grids. Advances in machine learning offer an alternative path towards more efficient and accurate weather forecasts. The rise of machine learning based weather forecasting models has also spurred the development of machine learning based DA models or even purely machine learning based weather forecasting systems. This paper introduces FuXi Weather, an end-to-end machine learning based weather forecasting system. FuXi Weather employs specialized data preprocessing and multi-modal data fusion techniques to integrate information from diverse sources under all-sky conditions, including microwave sounders from 3 polar-orbiting satellites and radio occultation data from Global Navigation Satellite System. Operating on a 6-hourly DA and forecasting cycle, FuXi Weather independently generates robust and accurate 10-day global weather forecasts at a spatial resolution of 0.25\textdegree. It surpasses the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts high-resolution forecasts in terms of predictability, extending the skillful forecast lead times for several key weather variables such as the geopotential height at 500 hPa from 9.25 days to 9.5 days. The system's high computational efficiency and robust performance, even with limited observations, demonstrates its potential as a promising alternative to traditional NWP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saiful Islam, Md. Nahid Hasan, Pitambar Khanra</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prevalence of graph-structured data across various domains has intensified greater interest in graph classification tasks. While numerous sophisticated graph learning methods have emerged, their complexity often hinders practical implementation. In this article, we address this challenge by proposing a method that constructs feature vectors based on fundamental graph structural properties. We demonstrate that these features, despite their simplicity, are powerful enough to capture the intrinsic characteristics of graphs within the same class. We explore the efficacy of our approach using three distinct machine learning methods, highlighting how our feature-based classification leverages the inherent structural similarities of graphs within the same class to achieve accurate classification. A key advantage of our approach is its simplicity, which makes it accessible and adaptable to a broad range of applications, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our method, showing that it not only reveals a competitive performance but in some cases surpasses the accuracy of more complex, state-of-the-art techniques. Our findings suggest that a focus on fundamental graph features can provide a robust and efficient alternative for graph classification, offering significant potential for both research and practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yam Eitan, Yoav Gelberg, Guy Bar-Shalom, Fabrizio Frasca, Michael Bronstein, Haggai Maron</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) facilitates learning from data represented by topological structures. The primary model utilized in this setting is higher-order message-passing (HOMP), which extends traditional graph message-passing neural networks (MPNN) to diverse topological domains. Given the significant expressivity limitations of MPNNs, our paper aims to explore both the strengths and weaknesses of HOMP's expressive power and subsequently design novel architectures to address these limitations. We approach this from several perspectives: First, we demonstrate HOMP's inability to distinguish between topological objects based on fundamental topological and metric properties such as diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology. Second, we show HOMP's limitations in fully leveraging the topological structure of objects constructed using common lifting and pooling operators on graphs. Finally, we compare HOMP's expressive power to hypergraph networks, which are the most extensively studied TDL methods. We then develop two new classes of TDL models: multi-cellular networks (MCN) and scalable multi-cellular networks (SMCN). These models draw inspiration from expressive graph architectures. While MCN can reach full expressivity but is highly unscalable, SMCN offers a more scalable alternative that still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity limitations. Finally, we construct a synthetic dataset, where TDL models are tasked with separating pairs of topological objects based on basic topological properties. We demonstrate that while HOMP is unable to distinguish between any of the pairs in the dataset, SMCN successfully distinguishes all pairs, empirically validating our theoretical findings. Our work opens a new design space and new opportunities for TDL, paving the way for more expressive and versatile models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoav Gelberg, Tycho F. A. van der Ouderaa, Mark van der Wilk, Yarin Gal</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight space symmetries in neural network architectures, such as permutation symmetries in MLPs, give rise to Bayesian neural network (BNN) posteriors with many equivalent modes. This multimodality poses a challenge for variational inference (VI) techniques, which typically rely on approximating the posterior with a unimodal distribution. In this work, we investigate the impact of weight space permutation symmetries on VI. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that these symmetries lead to biases in the approximate posterior, which degrade predictive performance and posterior fit if not explicitly accounted for. To mitigate this behavior, we leverage the symmetric structure of the posterior and devise a symmetrization mechanism for constructing permutation invariant variational posteriors. We show that the symmetrized distribution has a strictly better fit to the true posterior, and that it can be trained using the original ELBO objective with a modified KL regularization term. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach mitigates the aforementioned biases and results in improved predictions and a higher ELBO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Gholipour, Farid Bozorgnia, Kailash Hambarde, Hamzeh MohammadGheymasi, Javier Mancilla, Andre Sequeira, Joao Neves</p>
<p>Abstract: Laplacian learning method is a well-established technique in classical graph-based semi-supervised learning, but its potential in the quantum domain remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the performance of the Laplacian-based Quantum Semi-Supervised Learning (QSSL) method across four benchmark datasets -- Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer Wisconsin, and Heart Disease. Further analysis explores the impact of increasing Qubit counts, revealing that adding more Qubits to a quantum system doesn't always improve performance. The effectiveness of additional Qubits depends on the quantum algorithm and how well it matches the dataset. Additionally, we examine the effects of varying entangling layers on entanglement entropy and test accuracy. The performance of Laplacian learning is highly dependent on the number of entangling layers, with optimal configurations varying across different datasets. Typically, moderate levels of entanglement offer the best balance between model complexity and generalization capabilities. These observations highlight the crucial need for precise hyperparameter tuning tailored to each dataset to achieve optimal performance in Laplacian learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfei Li, Han Feng, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the intersection of sparse coding theory and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish a thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend this convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikalai Korbit, Mario Zanon</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular technique used to solve problems arising in machine learning. While very effective, SGD also has some weaknesses and various modifications of the basic algorithm have been proposed in order to at least partially tackle them, mostly yielding accelerated versions of SGD. Filling a gap in the literature, we present a modification of the SGD algorithm exploiting approximate second-order information based on the Gauss-Newton approach. The new method, which we call Incremental Gauss-Newton Descent (IGND), has essentially the same computational burden as standard SGD, appears to converge faster on certain classes of problems, and can also be accelerated. The key intuition making it possible to implement IGND efficiently is that, in the incremental case, approximate second-order information can be condensed into a scalar value that acts as a scaling constant of the update. We derive IGND starting from the theory supporting Gauss-Newton methods in a general setting and then explain how IGND can also be interpreted as a well-scaled version of SGD, which makes tuning the algorithm simpler, and provides increased robustness. Finally, we show how IGND can be used in practice by solving supervised learning tasks as well as reinforcement learning problems. The simulations show that IGND can significantly outperform SGD while performing at least as well as SGD in the worst case.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05584">Dynamical causality under invisible confounders</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinling Yan, Shao-Wu Zhang, Chihao Zhang, Weitian Huang, Jifan Shi, Luonan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Causality inference is prone to spurious causal interactions, due to the substantial confounders in a complex system. While many existing methods based on the statistical methods or dynamical methods attempt to address misidentification challenges, there remains a notable lack of effective methods to infer causality, in particular in the presence of invisible/unobservable confounders. As a result, accurately inferring causation with invisible confounders remains a largely unexplored and outstanding issue in data science and AI fields. In this work, we propose a method to overcome such challenges to infer dynamical causality under invisible confounders (CIC method) and further reconstruct the invisible confounders from time-series data by developing an orthogonal decomposition theorem in a delay embedding space. The core of our CIC method lies in its ability to decompose the observed variables not in their original space but in their delay embedding space into the common and private subspaces respectively, thereby quantifying causality between those variables both theoretically and computationally. This theoretical foundation ensures the causal detection for any high-dimensional system even with only two observed variables under many invisible confounders, which is actually a long-standing problem in the field. In addition to the invisible confounder problem, such a decomposition actually makes the intertwined variables separable in the embedding space, thus also solving the non-separability problem of causal inference. Extensive validation of the CIC method is carried out using various real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrates its effectiveness to reconstruct real biological networks even with unobserved confounders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikun Ban, Yunzhe Qi, Tianxin Wei, Lihui Liu, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: The contextual bandit has been identified as a powerful framework to formulate the recommendation process as a sequential decision-making process, where each item is regarded as an arm and the objective is to minimize the regret of $T$ rounds. In this paper, we study a new problem, Clustering of Neural Bandits, by extending previous work to the arbitrary reward function, to strike a balance between user heterogeneity and user correlations in the recommender system. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm called M-CNB, which utilizes a meta-learner to represent and rapidly adapt to dynamic clusters, along with an informative Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based exploration strategy. We provide an instance-dependent performance guarantee for the proposed algorithm that withstands the adversarial context, and we further prove the guarantee is at least as good as state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches under the same assumptions. In extensive experiments conducted in both recommendation and online classification scenarios, M-CNB outperforms SOTA baselines. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving online recommendation and online classification performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores self-supervised disentangled representation learning within sequential data, focusing on separating time-independent and time-varying factors in videos. We propose a new model that breaks the usual independence assumption between those factors by explicitly accounting for the causal relationship between the static/dynamic variables and that improves the model expressivity through additional Normalizing Flows. A formal definition of the factors is proposed. This formalism leads to the derivation of sufficient conditions for the ground truth factors to be identifiable, and to the introduction of a novel theoretically grounded disentanglement constraint that can be directly and efficiently incorporated into our new framework. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous complex state-of-the-art techniques in scenarios where the dynamics of a scene are influenced by its content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqiu Chen, Xuebin Yao, Pradeep Subedi, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharclab/Residual-INR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Harkin, Xueqin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper undertakes a comprehensive investigation of electricity price forecasting methods, focused on the Irish Integrated Single Electricity Market, particularly on changes during recent periods of high volatility. The primary objective of this research is to evaluate and compare the performance of various forecasting models, ranging from traditional machine learning models to more complex neural networks, as well as the impact of different lengths of training periods. The performance metrics, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and relative mean absolute error, are utilized to assess and compare the accuracy of each model. A comprehensive set of input features was investigated and selected from data recorded between October 2018 and September 2022. The paper demonstrates that the daily EU Natural Gas price is a more useful feature for electricity price forecasting in Ireland than the daily Henry Hub Natural Gas price. This study also shows that the correlation of features to the day-ahead market price has changed in recent years. The price of natural gas on the day and the amount of wind energy on the grid that hour are significantly more important than any other features. More specifically speaking, the input fuel for electricity has become a more important driver of the price of it, than the total generation or demand. In addition, it can be seen that System Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP) is highly correlated with the day-ahead market price, and that renewables are pushing down the price of electricity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Mirzaeifard, Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed sensors in the internet-of-things (IoT) generate vast amounts of sparse data. Analyzing this high-dimensional data and identifying relevant predictors pose substantial challenges, especially when data is preferred to remain on the device where it was collected for reasons such as data integrity, communication bandwidth, and privacy. This paper introduces a federated quantile regression algorithm to address these challenges. Quantile regression provides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables than mean regression models. However, traditional approaches face difficulties when dealing with nonconvex sparse penalties and the inherent non-smoothness of the loss function. For this purpose, we propose a federated smoothing proximal gradient (FSPG) algorithm that integrates a smoothing mechanism with the proximal gradient framework, thereby enhancing both precision and computational speed. This integration adeptly handles optimization over a network of devices, each holding local data samples, making it particularly effective in federated learning scenarios. The FSPG algorithm ensures steady progress and reliable convergence in each iteration by maintaining or reducing the value of the objective function. By leveraging nonconvex penalties, such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the proposed method can identify and preserve key predictors within sparse models. Comprehensive simulations validate the robust theoretical foundations of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate improved estimation precision and reliable convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.</p>

Here, we propose a method that can accommodate unmeasured discrete confounding. Extending recent identifiability results in deep latent variable models, we show theoretically that confounding can be detected and corrected under the assumption that the observed data is a piecewise affine transformation of a latent Gaussian mixture model and that the identity of the mixture components is confounded. We provide a flow-based algorithm to estimate this model and perform deconfounding. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data provide support for the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dandan Zhao, Karthick Sharma, Hongpeng Yin, Yuxin Qi, Shuhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault diagnosis (FD) is essential for maintaining operational safety and minimizing economic losses by detecting system abnormalities. Recently, deep learning (DL)-driven FD methods have gained prominence, offering significant improvements in precision and adaptability through the utilization of extensive datasets and advanced DL models. Modern industrial environments, however, demand FD methods that can handle new fault types, dynamic conditions, large-scale data, and provide real-time responses with minimal prior information. Although online continual learning (OCL) demonstrates potential in addressing these requirements by enabling DL models to continuously learn from streaming data, it faces challenges such as data redundancy, imbalance, and limited labeled data. To overcome these limitations, we propose SRTFD, a scalable real-time fault diagnosis framework that enhances OCL with three critical methods: Retrospect Coreset Selection (RCS), which selects the most relevant data to reduce redundant training and improve efficiency; Global Balance Technique (GBT), which ensures balanced coreset selection and robust model performance; and Confidence and Uncertainty-driven Pseudo-label Learning (CUPL), which updates the model using unlabeled data for continuous adaptation. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and two public simulated datasets demonstrate SRTFD's effectiveness and potential for providing advanced, scalable, and precise fault diagnosis in modern industrial systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Restless Multi-Arm Bandits (RMABs) offers a promising avenue for addressing allocation problems with resource constraints and temporal dynamics. However, classic RMAB models largely overlook the challenges of (systematic) data errors - a common occurrence in real-world scenarios due to factors like varying data collection protocols and intentional noise for differential privacy. We demonstrate that conventional RL algorithms used to train RMABs can struggle to perform well in such settings. To solve this problem, we propose the first communication learning approach in RMABs, where we study which arms, when involved in communication, are most effective in mitigating the influence of such systematic data errors. In our setup, the arms receive Q-function parameters from similar arms as messages to guide behavioral policies, steering Q-function updates. We learn communication strategies by considering the joint utility of messages across all pairs of arms and using a Q-network architecture that decomposes the joint utility. Both theoretical and empirical evidence validate the effectiveness of our method in significantly improving RMAB performance across diverse problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In drug discovery, predicting the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of small-molecule drugs is critical for ensuring safety and efficacy. However, the process of accurately predicting these properties is often resource-intensive and requires extensive experimental data. To address this challenge, we propose SMILES-Mamba, a two-stage model that leverages both unlabeled and labeled data through a combination of self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. The model first pre-trains on a large corpus of unlabeled SMILES strings to capture the underlying chemical structure and relationships, before being fine-tuned on smaller, labeled datasets specific to ADMET tasks. Our results demonstrate that SMILES-Mamba exhibits competitive performance across 22 ADMET datasets, achieving the highest score in 14 tasks, highlighting the potential of self-supervised learning in improving molecular property prediction. This approach not only enhances prediction accuracy but also reduces the dependence on large, labeled datasets, offering a promising direction for future research in drug discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Fast and Scalable Semi-supervised Multi-view Subspace Clustering (FSSMSC) method, a novel solution to the high computational complexity commonly found in existing approaches. FSSMSC features linear computational and space complexity relative to the size of the data. The method generates a consensus anchor graph across all views, representing each data point as a sparse linear combination of chosen landmarks. Unlike traditional methods that manage the anchor graph construction and the label propagation process separately, this paper proposes a unified optimization model that facilitates simultaneous learning of both. An effective alternating update algorithm with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the unified optimization model. Additionally, the method employs the obtained anchor graph and landmarks' low-dimensional representations to deduce low-dimensional representations for raw data. Following this, a straightforward clustering approach is conducted on these low-dimensional representations to achieve the final clustering results. The effectiveness and efficiency of FSSMSC are validated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of varying scales.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protecting data privacy in deep learning (DL) is of crucial importance. Several celebrated privacy notions have been established and used for privacy-preserving DL. However, many existing mechanisms achieve privacy at the cost of significant utility degradation and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a stochastic differential equation-based residual perturbation for privacy-preserving DL, which injects Gaussian noise into each residual mapping of ResNets. Theoretically, we prove that residual perturbation guarantees differential privacy (DP) and reduces the generalization gap of DL. Empirically, we show that residual perturbation is computationally efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) in utility maintenance without sacrificing membership privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianping Zhou, Junhao Li, Guanjie Zheng, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

<p>Abstract: The increasing generation of data in different areas of life, such as the environment, highlights the need to explore new techniques for processing and exploiting data for useful purposes. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques, especially through deep learning models, are key tools to be used on the large amount of data that can be obtained, for example, from weather radars. In many cases, the information collected by these radars is not open, or belongs to different institutions, thus needing to deal with the distributed nature of this data. In this work, the applicability of a personalized federated learning architecture, which has been called adapFL, on distributed weather radar images is addressed. To this end, given a single available radar covering 400 km in diameter, the captured images are divided in such a way that they are disjointly distributed into four different federated clients. The results obtained with adapFL are analyzed in each zone, as well as in a central area covering part of the surface of each of the previously distributed areas. The ultimate goal of this work is to study the generalization capability of this type of learning technique for its extrapolation to use cases in which a representative number of radars is available, whose data can not be centralized due to technical, legal or administrative concerns. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the performance obtained in each zone with the adapFL approach allows improving the results of the federated learning approach, the individual deep learning models and the classical Continuity Tracking Radar Echoes by Correlation approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhui Liu, Tieke He, Qing Wu, Tao Zheng, Jianhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Attributed graph clustering, which aims to group the nodes of an attributed graph into disjoint clusters, has made promising advancements in recent years. However, most existing methods face challenges when applied to large graphs due to the expensive computational cost and high memory usage. In this paper, we introduce Scalable and Adaptive Spectral Embedding (SASE), a simple attributed graph clustering method devoid of parameter learning. SASE comprises three main components: node features smoothing via $k$-order simple graph convolution, scalable spectral clustering using random Fourier features, and adaptive order selection. With these designs, SASE not only effectively captures global cluster structures but also exhibits linear time and space complexity relative to the graph size. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of SASE. For example, on the ArXiv dataset with 169K nodes and 1.17M edges, SASE achieves a 6.9\% improvement in ACC and a $5.87\times$ speedup compared to the runner-up, S3GC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongguang Ye, Longcan Chen, Wei-Bin Kou, Jinyuan Zhang, Hisao Ishibuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Pareto set learning (PSL) is an emerging approach for acquiring the complete Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. Existing methods primarily rely on the mapping of preference vectors in the objective space to Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space. However, the sampling of preference vectors theoretically requires prior knowledge of the Pareto front shape to ensure high performance of the PSL methods. Designing a sampling strategy of preference vectors is difficult since the Pareto front shape cannot be known in advance. To make Pareto set learning work effectively in any Pareto front shape, we propose a Pareto front shape-agnostic Pareto Set Learning (GPSL) that does not require the prior information about the Pareto front. The fundamental concept behind GPSL is to treat the learning of the Pareto set as a distribution transformation problem. Specifically, GPSL can transform an arbitrary distribution into the Pareto set distribution. We demonstrate that training a neural network by maximizing hypervolume enables the process of distribution transformation. Our proposed method can handle any shape of the Pareto front and learn the Pareto set without requiring prior knowledge. Experimental results show the high performance of our proposed method on diverse test problems compared with recent Pareto set learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of neural state estimation in power distribution systems. We identified a research gap in the current state of the art, which lies in the inability of models to adapt to changes in the power grid, such as loss of sensors and branch switching. Our experiments demonstrate that graph neural networks are the most promising models for this use case and that their performance can degrade with scale.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Sun, Ignavier Ng, Guangyi Chen, Yifan Shen, Qirong Ho, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the causal relations between interested variables plays a pivotal role in representation learning as it provides deep insights into the dataset. Identifiability, as the central theme of this approach, normally hinges on leveraging data from multiple distributions (intervention, distribution shift, time series, etc.). Despite the exciting development in this field, a practical but often overlooked problem is: what if those distribution shifts happen sequentially? In contrast, any intelligence possesses the capacity to abstract and refine learned knowledge sequentially -- lifelong learning. In this paper, with a particular focus on the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) framework, we move one step forward toward the question of enabling models to learn meaningful (identifiable) representations in a sequential manner, termed continual causal representation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that model identifiability progresses from a subspace level to a component-wise level as the number of distributions increases. Empirically, we show that our method achieves performance comparable to nonlinear ICA methods trained jointly on multiple offline distributions and, surprisingly, the incoming new distribution does not necessarily benefit the identification of all latent variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mandana Farhang Ghahfarokhi, Seyed Hossein Sonbolestan, Mahta Zamanizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of three common deep learning architectures, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and 3D-CNN, in the context of surrogate storm surge modeling. The study site for this paper is the Tampa Bay area in Florida. Using high-resolution atmospheric data from the reanalysis models and historical water level data from NOAA tide stations, we trained and tested these models to evaluate their performance. Our findings indicate that the CNN-LSTM model outperforms the other architectures, achieving a test loss of 0.010 and an R-squared (R2) score of 0.84. The LSTM model, although it achieved the lowest training loss of 0.007 and the highest training R2 of 0.88, exhibited poorer generalization with a test loss of 0.014 and an R2 of 0.77. The 3D-CNN model showed reasonable performance with a test loss of 0.011 and an R2 of 0.82 but displayed instability under extreme conditions. A case study on Hurricane Ian, which caused a significant negative surge of -1.5 meters in Tampa Bay indicates the CNN-LSTM model's robustness and accuracy in extreme scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grace Liu, Michael Tang, Benjamin Eysenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present empirical evidence of skills and directed exploration emerging from a simple RL algorithm long before any successful trials are observed. For example, in a manipulation task, the agent is given a single observation of the goal state and learns skills, first for moving its end-effector, then for pushing the block, and finally for picking up and placing the block. These skills emerge before the agent has ever successfully placed the block at the goal location and without the aid of any reward functions, demonstrations, or manually-specified distance metrics. Once the agent has learned to reach the goal state reliably, exploration is reduced. Implementing our method involves a simple modification of prior work and does not require density estimates, ensembles, or any additional hyperparameters. Intuitively, the proposed method seems like it should be terrible at exploration, and we lack a clear theoretical understanding of why it works so effectively, though our experiments provide some hints.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05807">Kernel Density Estimators in Large Dimensions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Biroli, Marc M\'ezard</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies Kernel density estimation for a high-dimensional distribution $\rho(x)$. Traditional approaches have focused on the limit of large number of data points $n$ and fixed dimension $d$. We analyze instead the regime where both the number $n$ of data points $y_i$ and their dimensionality $d$ grow with a fixed ratio $\alpha=(\log n)/d$. Our study reveals three distinct statistical regimes for the kernel-based estimate of the density $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)=\frac{1}{n h^d}\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-y_i}{h}\right)$, depending on the bandwidth $h$: a classical regime for large bandwidth where the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds, which is akin to the one found in traditional approaches. Below a certain value of the bandwidth, $h_{CLT}(\alpha)$, we find that the CLT breaks down. The statistics of $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ for a fixed $x$ drawn from $\rho(x)$ is given by a heavy-tailed distribution (an alpha-stable distribution). In particular below a value $h_G(\alpha)$, we find that $\hat \rho_h^{\mathcal {D}}(x)$ is governed by extreme value statistics: only a few points in the database matter and give the dominant contribution to the density estimator. We provide a detailed analysis for high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian data. We show that the optimal bandwidth threshold based on Kullback-Leibler divergence lies in the new statistical regime identified in this paper. Our findings reveal limitations of classical approaches, show the relevance of these new statistical regimes, and offer new insights for Kernel density estimation in high-dimensional settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet Anh Nguyen, Minh Lenhat, Khoa Nguyen, Duong Duc Hieu, Dao Huu Hung, Truong Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: The versatility of self-attention mechanism earned transformers great success in almost all data modalities, with limitations on the quadratic complexity and difficulty of training. To apply transformers across different data modalities, practitioners have to make specific clever data-modality-dependent constructions. In this paper, we propose Sampling Foundational Transformer (SFT) that can work on multiple data modalities (e.g., point cloud, graph, and sequence) and constraints (e.g., rotational-invariant). The existence of such model is important as contemporary foundational modeling requires operability on multiple data sources. For efficiency on large number of tokens, our model relies on our context aware sampling-without-replacement mechanism for both linear asymptotic computational complexity and real inference time gain. For efficiency, we rely on our newly discovered pseudoconvex formulation of transformer layer to increase model's convergence rate. As a model working on multiple data modalities, SFT has achieved competitive results on many benchmarks, while being faster in inference, compared to other very specialized models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dheeraj Baby, Soumyabrata Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the low rank matrix completion problem in an online setting with ${M}$ users, ${N}$ items, ${T}$ rounds, and an unknown rank-$r$ reward matrix ${R}\in \mathbb{R}^{{M}\times {N}}$. This problem has been well-studied in the literature and has several applications in practice. In each round, we recommend ${S}$ carefully chosen distinct items to every user and observe noisy rewards. In the regime where ${M},{N} >> {T}$, we propose two distinct computationally efficient algorithms for recommending items to users and analyze them under the benign \emph{hott items} assumption.1) First, for ${S}=1$, under additional incoherence/smoothness assumptions on ${R}$, we propose the phased algorithm \textsc{PhasedClusterElim}. Our algorithm obtains a near-optimal per-user regret of $\tilde{O}({N}{M}^{-1}(\Delta^{-1}+\Delta_{{hott}}^{-2}))$ where $\Delta_{{hott}},\Delta$ are problem-dependent gap parameters with $\Delta_{{hott}} >> \Delta$ almost always. 2) Second, we consider a simplified setting with ${S}=r$ where we make significantly milder assumptions on ${R}$. Here, we introduce another phased algorithm, \textsc{DeterminantElim}, to derive a regret guarantee of $\widetilde{O}({N}{M}^{-1/r}\Delta_{det}^{-1}))$ where $\Delta_{{det}}$ is another problem-dependent gap. Both algorithms crucially use collaboration among users to jointly eliminate sub-optimal items for groups of users successively in phases, but with distinctive and novel approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengshuai Yao, Mengna Liu, Xu Cheng, Fan Shi, Huan Li, Xiufeng Liu, Shengyong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series classification with missing data is a prevalent issue in time series analysis, as temporal data often contain missing values in practical applications. The traditional two-stage approach, which handles imputation and classification separately, can result in sub-optimal performance as label information is not utilized in the imputation process. On the other hand, a one-stage approach can learn features under missing information, but feature representation is limited as imputed errors are propagated in the classification process. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network that unifies data imputation and representation learning within a single framework, allowing the imputation process to take advantage of label information. Differing from previous methods, our approach places less emphasis on the accuracy of imputation data and instead prioritizes classification performance. A specifically designed multi-scale feature learning module is implemented to extract useful information from the noise-imputation data. The proposed model is evaluated on 68 univariate time series datasets from the UCR archive, as well as a multivariate time series dataset with various missing data ratios and 4 real-world datasets with missing information. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for incomplete time series classification, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.</p>

Despite its ubiquity, the mechanics of low-rank approximation and its application in adaptation can sometimes be obscure, leaving practitioners and researchers with questions about its true capabilities and limitations. This paper seeks to clarify low-rank approximation and adaptation by offering a comprehensive guide that reveals their inner workings and explains their utility in a clear and accessible way. Our focus here is to develop a solid intuition for how low-rank approximation and adaptation operate, and why they are so effective. We begin with basic concepts and gradually build up to the mathematical underpinnings, ensuring that readers of all backgrounds can gain a deeper understanding of low-rank approximation and adaptation. We strive to strike a balance between informal explanations and rigorous mathematics, ensuring that both newcomers and experienced experts can benefit from this survey. Additionally, we introduce new low-rank decomposition and adaptation algorithms that have not yet been explored in the field, hoping that future researchers will investigate their potential applicability.</p>

This enables the derivation of new policy-based GFlowNet training methods, in contrast to existing ones resembling value-based RL. It is known that the design of backward policies in GFlowNet training affects efficiency. We further develop a coupled training strategy that jointly solves GFlowNet forward policy training and backward policy design. Performance analysis is provided with a theoretical guarantee of our policy-based GFlowNet training. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets verify that our policy-based strategies provide advanced RL perspectives for robust gradient estimation to improve GFlowNet performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ferdous Pervej, Minseok Choi, Andreas F. Molisch</p>
<p>Abstract: While FL is a widely popular distributed ML strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous system configurations of the wireless device pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called OSAFL, specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since it has long been proven that under extreme resource constraints, clients may perform an arbitrary number of local training steps, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks -- each with three different datasets -- with four popular ML models validate the effectiveness of OSAFL compared to six existing state-of-the-art FL baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Satellite images have become increasingly valuable for modelling regional climate change effects. Earth surface forecasting represents one such task that integrates satellite images with meteorological data to capture the joint evolution of regional climate change effects. However, understanding the complex relationship between specific meteorological variables and land surface evolution poses a significant challenge. In light of this challenge, our paper introduces a pipeline that integrates principles from both perturbation-based explainability techniques like LIME and global marginal explainability techniques like PDP, besides addressing the constraints of using such techniques when applying them to high-dimensional spatiotemporal deep models. The proposed pipeline simplifies the undertaking of diverse investigative analyses, such as marginal sensitivity analysis, marginal correlation analysis, lag analysis, etc., on complex land surface forecasting models In this study we utilised Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) as the surface forecasting model and did analyses on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the surface forecasts, since meteorological variables like temperature, pressure, and precipitation significantly influence it. The study area encompasses various regions in Europe. Our analyses show that precipitation exhibits the highest sensitivity in the study area, followed by temperature and pressure. Pressure has little to no direct effect on NDVI. Additionally, interesting nonlinear correlations between meteorological variables and NDVI have been uncovered.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Agussurja, Xinyang Lu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing sample-based methods, like influence functions and representer points, measure the importance of a training point by approximating the effect of its removal from training. As such, they are skewed towards outliers and points that are very close to the decision boundaries. The explanations provided by these methods are often static and not specific enough for different test points. In this paper, we propose a method to generate an explanation in the form of support spectrums which are based on two main ideas: the support sets and a global-to-local importance measure. The support set is the set of training points, in the predicted class, that ``lie in between'' the test point and training points in the other classes. They indicate how well the test point can be distinguished from the points not in the predicted class. The global-to-local importance measure is obtained by decoupling existing methods into the global and local components which are then used to select the points in the support set. Using this method, we are able to generate explanations that are tailored to specific test points. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness of the method in image classification and text generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Yuwono, Dorothea Schwung, Andreas Schwung</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for enhancing distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach focuses on the practical relevant industrial setting where sharing and transferring gained knowledge among similar-behaved players improves the self-learning mechanism in large-scale systems. With TL-SbPGs, the gained knowledge can be reused by other players to optimize their policies, thereby improving the learning outcomes of the players and accelerating the learning process. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. We formally prove the applicability of the SbPG framework in transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method to determine the optimal timing and weighting of the transfer learning procedure during the training phase. Through experiments on a laboratory-scale testbed, we demonstrate that TL-SbPGs significantly boost production efficiency while reducing power consumption of the production schedules while also outperforming native SbPGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental and challenging learning task, which is conventionally approached by grouping similar vertices based on edge structure and feature similarity.In contrast to previous methods, in this paper, we investigate how multi-view feature propagation can influence cluster discovery in graph data.To this end, we present Graph Clustering With Cross-View Feature Propagation (GCCFP), a novel method that leverages multi-view feature propagation to enhance cluster identification in graph data.GCCFP employs a unified objective function that utilizes graph topology and multi-view vertex features to determine vertex cluster membership, regularized by a module that supports key latent feature propagation. We derive an iterative algorithm to optimize this function, prove model convergence within a finite number of iterations, and analyze its computational complexity. Our experiments on various real-world graphs demonstrate the superior clustering performance of GCCFP compared to well-established methods, manifesting its effectiveness across different scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio G. Charles</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an $E(n)$-equivariant Transformer architecture for spatio-temporal graph data. By imposing rotation, translation, and permutation equivariance inductive biases in both space and time, we show that the Spacetime $E(n)$-Transformer (SET) outperforms purely spatial and temporal models without symmetry-preserving properties. We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafa{\l} Karczewski, Samuel Kaski, Markus Heinonen, Vikas Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Several generative models with elaborate training and sampling procedures have been proposed recently to accelerate structure-based drug design (SBDD); however, perplexingly, their empirical performance turns out to be suboptimal. We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks (GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We also investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunyi Zhou, Anmin Fu, Zhiyang Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of the right to be forgotten has led to growing interest in machine unlearning, but reliable validation methods are lacking, creating opportunities for dishonest model providers to mislead data contributors. Traditional invasive methods like backdoor injection are not feasible for legacy data. To address this, we introduce TruVRF, a non-invasive unlearning verification framework operating at class-, volume-, and sample-level granularities. TruVRF includes three Unlearning-Metrics designed to detect different types of dishonest servers: Neglecting, Lazy, and Deceiving. Unlearning-Metric-I checks class alignment, Unlearning-Metric-II verifies sample count, and Unlearning-Metric-III confirms specific sample deletion. Evaluations on three datasets show TruVRF's robust performance, with over 90% accuracy for Metrics I and III, and a 4.8% to 8.2% inference deviation for Metric II. TruVRF also demonstrates generalizability and practicality across various conditions and with state-of-the-art unlearning frameworks like SISA and Amnesiac Unlearning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06067">Don&#x27;t You (Project Around Discs)? Neural Network Surrogate and Projected Gradient Descent for Calibrating an Intervertebral Disc Finite Element Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Matan Atad, Gabriel Gruber, Marx Ribeiro, Luis Fernando Nicolini, Robert Graf, Hendrik M\"oller, Kati Nispel, Ivan Ezhov, Daniel Rueckert, Jan S. Kirschke</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate calibration of finite element (FE) models of human intervertebral discs (IVDs) is essential for their reliability and application in diagnosing and planning treatments for spinal conditions. Traditional calibration methods are computationally intensive, requiring iterative, derivative-free optimization algorithms that often take hours or days to converge.
  This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel, efficient, and effective calibration method for an L4-L5 IVD FE model using a neural network (NN) surrogate. The NN surrogate predicts simulation outcomes with high accuracy, outperforming other machine learning models, and significantly reduces the computational cost associated with traditional FE simulations. Next, a Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) approach guided by gradients of the NN surrogate is proposed to efficiently calibrate FE models. Our method explicitly enforces feasibility with a projection step, thus maintaining material bounds throughout the optimization process.
  The proposed method is evaluated against state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithm (GA) and inverse model baselines on synthetic and in vitro experimental datasets. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on synthetic data, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.06 compared to the baselines' MAE of 0.18 and 0.54, respectively. On experimental specimens, our method outperforms the baseline in 5 out of 6 cases. Most importantly, our approach reduces calibration time to under three seconds, compared to up to 8 days per sample required by traditional calibration. Such efficiency paves the way for applying more complex FE models, enabling accurate patient-specific simulations and advancing spinal treatment planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Zhiqi Lin, Min Chen, Junmei Yang, Delu Zeng, John Paisley</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional deep Gaussian processes model the data evolution using a discrete hierarchy, whereas differential Gaussian processes (DIFFGPs) represent the evolution as an infinitely deep Gaussian process. However, prior DIFFGP methods often overlook the uncertainty of kernel hyperparameters and assume them to be fixed and time-invariant, failing to leverage the unique synergy between continuous-time models and approximate inference. In this work, we propose a fully Bayesian approach that treats the kernel hyperparameters as random variables and constructs coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to learn their posterior distribution and that of inducing points. By incorporating estimation uncertainty on hyperparameters, our method enhances the model's flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamics. Additionally, our approach provides a time-varying, comprehensive, and realistic posterior approximation through coupling variables using SDE methods. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our method over traditional approaches, showcasing its superior performance in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other metrics. Our work opens up exciting research avenues for advancing Bayesian inference and offers a powerful modeling tool for continuous-time Gaussian processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Bian, Yujie Luo, Ping Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrimination mitigation with machine learning (ML) models could be complicated because multiple factors may interweave with each other including hierarchically and historically. Yet few existing fairness measures are able to capture the discrimination level within ML models in the face of multiple sensitive attributes. To bridge this gap, we propose a fairness measure based on distances between sets from a manifold perspective, named as 'harmonic fairness measure via manifolds (HFM)' with two optional versions, which can deal with a fine-grained discrimination evaluation for several sensitive attributes of multiple values. To accelerate the computation of distances of sets, we further propose two approximation algorithms named 'Approximation of distance between sets for one sensitive attribute with multiple values (ApproxDist)' and 'Approximation of extended distance between sets for several sensitive attributes with multiple values (ExtendDist)' to respectively resolve bias evaluation of one single sensitive attribute with multiple values and that of several sensitive attributes with multiple values. Moreover, we provide an algorithmic effectiveness analysis for ApproxDist under certain assumptions to explain how well it could work. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed fairness measure HFM is valid and approximation algorithms (i.e., ApproxDist and ExtendDist) are effective and efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: This works investigates the generalization capabilities of MeshGraphNets (MGN) [Pfaff et al. Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks. ICML 2021] to unseen geometries for fluid dynamics, e.g. predicting the flow around a new obstacle that was not part of the training data. For this purpose, we create a new benchmark dataset for data-driven computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which extends DeepMind's flow around a cylinder dataset by including different shapes and multiple objects. We then use this new dataset to extend the generalization experiments conducted by DeepMind on MGNs by testing how well an MGN can generalize to different shapes. In our numerical tests, we show that MGNs can sometimes generalize well to various shapes by training on a dataset of one obstacle shape and testing on a dataset of another obstacle shape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mario Padilla Rodriguez, Mohamed Nafea</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the need for accurate diagnostic methods. This study benchmarks centralized and federated machine learning algorithms for heart disease classification using the UCI dataset which includes 920 patient records from four hospitals in the USA, Hungary and Switzerland. Our benchmark is supported by Shapley-value interpretability analysis to quantify features' importance for classification. In the centralized setup, various binary classification algorithms are trained on pooled data, with a support vector machine (SVM) achieving the highest testing accuracy of 83.3\%, surpassing the established benchmark of 78.7\% with logistic regression. Additionally, federated learning algorithms with four clients (hospitals) are explored, leveraging the dataset's natural partition to enhance privacy without sacrificing accuracy. Federated SVM, an uncommon approach in the literature, achieves a top testing accuracy of 73.8\%. Our interpretability analysis aligns with existing medical knowledge of heart disease indicators. Overall, this study establishes a benchmark for efficient and interpretable pre-screening tools for heart disease while maintaining patients' privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Holger Boche, Vit Fojtik, Adalbert Fono, Gitta Kutyniok</p>
<p>Abstract: The unwavering success of deep learning in the past decade led to the increasing prevalence of deep learning methods in various application fields. However, the downsides of deep learning, most prominently its lack of trustworthiness, may not be compatible with safety-critical or high-responsibility applications requiring stricter performance guarantees. Recently, several instances of deep learning applications have been shown to be subject to theoretical limitations of computability, undermining the feasibility of performance guarantees when employed on real-world computers. We extend the findings by studying computability in the deep learning framework from two perspectives: From an application viewpoint in the context of classification problems and a general limitation viewpoint in the context of training neural networks. In particular, we show restrictions on the algorithmic solvability of classification problems that also render the algorithmic detection of failure in computations in a general setting infeasible. Subsequently, we prove algorithmic limitations in training deep neural networks even in cases where the underlying problem is well-behaved. Finally, we end with a positive observation, showing that in quantized versions of classification and deep network training, computability restrictions do not arise or can be overcome to a certain degree.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vispi Karkaria, Jie Chen, Christopher Luey, Chase Siuta, Damien Lim, Robert Radulescu, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel digital twin framework for predictive maintenance of long-term physical systems. Using monitoring tire health as an application, we show how the digital twin framework can be used to enhance automotive safety and efficiency, and how the technical challenges can be overcome using a three-step approach. Firstly, for managing the data complexity over a long operation span, we employ data reduction techniques to concisely represent physical tires using historical performance and usage data. Relying on these data, for fast real-time prediction, we train a transformer-based model offline on our concise dataset to predict future tire health over time, represented as Remaining Casing Potential (RCP). Based on our architecture, our model quantifies both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, providing reliable confidence intervals around predicted RCP. Secondly, to incorporate real-time data, we update the predictive model in the digital twin framework, ensuring its accuracy throughout its life span with the aid of hybrid modeling and the use of discrepancy function. Thirdly, to assist decision making in predictive maintenance, we implement a Tire State Decision Algorithm, which strategically determines the optimal timing for tire replacement based on RCP forecasted by our transformer model. This approach ensures our digital twin accurately predicts system health, continually refines its digital representation, and supports predictive maintenance decisions. Our framework effectively embodies a physical system, leveraging big data and machine learning for predictive maintenance, model updates, and decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Shukla, Milton Halem</p>
<p>Abstract: Capitalizing on the recent availability of ERA5 monthly averaged long-term data records of mean atmospheric and climate fields based on high-resolution reanalysis, deep-learning architectures offer an alternative to physics-based daily numerical weather predictions for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) and annual means. A novel Deep UNet++-based Ensemble (DUNE) neural architecture is introduced, employing multi-encoder-decoder structures with residual blocks. When initialized from a prior month or year, this architecture produced the first AI-based global monthly, seasonal, or annual mean forecast of 2-meter temperatures (T2m) and sea surface temperatures (SST). ERA5 monthly mean data is used as input for T2m over land, SST over oceans, and solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere for each month of 40 years to train the model. Validation forecasts are performed for an additional two years, followed by five years of forecast evaluations to account for natural annual variability. AI-trained inference forecast weights generate forecasts in seconds, enabling ensemble seasonal forecasts. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) statistics are presented globally and over specific regions. These forecasts outperform persistence, climatology, and multiple linear regression for all domains. DUNE forecasts demonstrate comparable statistical accuracy to NOAA's operational monthly and seasonal probabilistic outlook forecasts over the US but at significantly higher resolutions. RMSE and ACC error statistics for other recent AI-based daily forecasts also show superior performance for DUNE-based forecasts. The DUNE model's application to an ensemble data assimilation cycle shows comparable forecast accuracy with a single high-resolution model, potentially eliminating the need for retraining on extrapolated datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

<p>Abstract: The analysis of tabular data has traditionally been dominated by gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs), known for their proficiency with mixed categorical and numerical features. However, recent deep learning innovations are challenging this dominance. We introduce Mambular, an adaptation of the Mamba architecture optimized for tabular data. We extensively benchmark Mambular against state-of-the-art models, including neural networks and tree-based methods, and demonstrate its competitive performance across diverse datasets. Additionally, we explore various adaptations of Mambular to understand its effectiveness for tabular data. We investigate different pooling strategies, feature interaction mechanisms, and bi-directional processing. Our analysis shows that interpreting features as a sequence and passing them through Mamba layers results in surprisingly performant models. The results highlight Mambulars potential as a versatile and powerful architecture for tabular data analysis, expanding the scope of deep learning applications in this domain.

We establish tight regret guarantees (up to constants), in a dynamic setting, with respect to the uncorrupted rounds and conduct experiments to validate our theory. Furthermore, we present a unified analysis framework for developing online optimization algorithms for non-convex (invex) losses, utilizing it to provide regret bounds with respect to the LEARN loss, which may be of independent interest.</p>

We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through 2D visualizations and GradientSHAP analysis. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed method, revealing distinct and compact clusters and diverse prototypes that capture essential features that lead to low-confidence decisions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micheline B\'en\'edicte Moumoula, Abdoul Kader Kabore, Jacques Klein, Tegawend\'e Bissyande</p>
<p>Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction with the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection.
  We investigate the capabilities of four (04) LLMs and eight (08) prompts for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. Both studies (based on LLMs and Embedding models) are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.98, for straightforward programming examples (e.g., from XLCoST). However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of code clones in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~2 and ~24 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Finally, we show that our approach facilitates MLIPs' training in a setting where the computation of forces is infeasible at the reference level, such as those employing complete-basis-set extrapolation.</p>

We use the novel approach to predict a complete set of pair-interaction parameters for the most successful GC method: UNIFAC, the workhorse for predicting activity coefficients in liquid mixtures. The resulting new method, UNIFAC 2.0, is trained and validated on more than 224,000 experimental data points, showcasing significantly enhanced prediction accuracy (e.g., nearly halving the mean squared error) and increased scope by eliminating gaps in the original model's parameter table. Moreover, the generic nature of the approach facilitates updating the method with new data or tailoring it to specific applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salvador Pineda, Juan P\'erez-Ruiz, Juan Miguel Morales</p>
<p>Abstract: The AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is essential for power system operations, but its non-convex nature makes it challenging to solve. A widely used simplification is the linearized DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem, which can be solved to global optimality, but whose optimal solution is always infeasible in the original AC-OPF problem. Recently, neural networks (NN) have been introduced for solving the AC-OPF problem at significantly faster computation times. However, these methods necessitate extensive datasets, are difficult to train, and are often viewed as black boxes, leading to resistance from operators who prefer more transparent and interpretable solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning-based approach that merges simplicity and interpretability, providing a bridge between traditional approximation methods and black-box learning techniques. Our approach not only provides transparency for operators but also achieves competitive accuracy. Numerical results across various power networks demonstrate that our method provides accuracy comparable to, and often surpassing, that of neural networks, particularly when training datasets are limited.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ferdinando Fioretto, Diptangshu Sen, Juba Ziani</p>
<p>Abstract: Networks are crucial components of many sectors, including telecommunications, healthcare, finance, energy, and transportation.The information carried in such networks often contains sensitive user data, like location data for commuters and packet data for online users. Therefore, when considering data release for networks, one must ensure that data release mechanisms do not leak information about individuals, quantified in a precise mathematical sense. Differential Privacy (DP) is the widely accepted, formal, state-of-the-art technique, which has found use in a variety of real-life settings including the 2020 U.S. Census, Apple users' device data, or Google's location data. Yet, the use of DP comes with new challenges, as the noise added for privacy introduces inaccuracies or biases and further, DP techniques can also distribute these biases disproportionately across different populations, inducing fairness issues. The goal of this paper is to characterize the impact of DP on bias and unfairness in the context of releasing information about networks, taking a departure from previous work which has studied these effects in the context of private population counts release (such as in the U.S. Census). To this end, we consider a network release problem where the network structure is known to all, but the weights on edges must be released privately. We consider the impact of this private release on a simple downstream decision-making task run by a third-party, which is to find the shortest path between any two pairs of nodes and recommend the best route to users. This setting is of highly practical relevance, mirroring scenarios in transportation networks, where preserving privacy while providing accurate routing information is crucial. Our work provides theoretical foundations and empirical evidence into the bias and unfairness arising due to privacy in these networked decision problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Colocrese, Erdem Koyuncu, Hulya Seferoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed inference techniques can be broadly classified into data-distributed and model-distributed schemes. In data-distributed inference (DDI), each worker carries the entire deep neural network (DNN) model but processes only a subset of the data. However, feeding the data to workers results in high communication costs, especially when the data is large. An emerging paradigm is model-distributed inference (MDI), where each worker carries only a subset of DNN layers. In MDI, a source device that has data processes a few layers of DNN and sends the output to a neighboring device, i.e., offloads the rest of the layers. This process ends when all layers are processed in a distributed manner. In this paper, we investigate the design and development of MDI with early-exit, which advocates that there is no need to process all the layers of a model for some data to reach the desired accuracy, i.e., we can exit the model without processing all the layers if target accuracy is reached. We design a framework MDI-Exit that adaptively determines early-exit and offloading policies as well as data admission at the source. Experimental results on a real-life testbed of NVIDIA Nano edge devices show that MDI-Exit processes more data when accuracy is fixed and results in higher accuracy for the fixed data rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwen Min, Zhen Wang, Fangfang Zhu, Taosheng Xu, Shunfang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis is pivotal for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, the high sparsity and complex noise patterns inherent in scRNA-seq data present significant challenges for traditional clustering methods. To address these issues, we propose a deep clustering method, Attention-Enhanced Structural Deep Embedding Graph Clustering (scASDC), which integrates multiple advanced modules to improve clustering accuracy and robustness.Our approach employs a multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture high-order structural relationships between cells, termed as the graph autoencoder module. To mitigate the oversmoothing issue in GCNs, we introduce a ZINB-based autoencoder module that extracts content information from the data and learns latent representations of gene expression. These modules are further integrated through an attention fusion mechanism, ensuring effective combination of gene expression and structural information at each layer of the GCN. Additionally, a self-supervised learning module is incorporated to enhance the robustness of the learned embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scASDC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and effective solution for single-cell clustering tasks. Our method paves the way for more accurate and meaningful analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, contributing to better understanding of cellular heterogeneity and biological processes.

<p>Abstract: Is there a way to design powerful AI systems based on machine learning methods that would satisfy probabilistic safety guarantees? With the long-term goal of obtaining a probabilistic guarantee that would apply in every context, we consider estimating a context-dependent bound on the probability of violating a given safety specification. Such a risk evaluation would need to be performed at run-time to provide a guardrail against dangerous actions of an AI. Noting that different plausible hypotheses about the world could produce very different outcomes, and because we do not know which one is right, we derive bounds on the safety violation probability predicted under the true but unknown hypothesis. Such bounds could be used to reject potentially dangerous actions. Our main results involve searching for cautious but plausible hypotheses, obtained by a maximization that involves Bayesian posteriors over hypotheses. We consider two forms of this result, in the iid case and in the non-iid case, and conclude with open problems towards turning such theoretical results into practical AI guardrails.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Xie, Mutahar Safdar, Lequn Chen, Seung Ki Moon, Yaoyao Fiona Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect laser additive manufacturing (LAM) process anomalies and defects. Multimodal fusion can improve in-situ monitoring performance by acquiring and integrating data from multiple modalities, including visual and audio data. However, multimodal fusion employs multiple sensors of different types, which leads to higher hardware, computational, and operational costs. This paper proposes a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology that transfers knowledge from a source to a target modality for LAM in-situ monitoring. CMKT enhances the usefulness of the features extracted from the target modality during the training phase and removes the sensors of the source modality during the prediction phase. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. Semantic alignment establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It utilizes a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of the same classes (e.g., visual defective and audio defective classes) and a separation loss to separate the distributions of different classes (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free classes). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving the features of one modality from the other modality using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning. The proposed CMKT methods were implemented and compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion in an LAM in-situ anomaly detection case study. The semantic alignment method achieves a 98.4% accuracy while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the accuracy of multimodal fusion (98.2%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Landon Dyken, Saugat Adhikari, Pravin Poudel, Steve Petruzza, Da Yan, Will Usher, Sidharth Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to assess damage and properly allocate relief efforts, mapping the extent of flood events is a necessary and important aspect of disaster management. In recent years, deep learning methods have evolved as an effective tool to quickly label high-resolution imagery and provide necessary flood extent mappings. These methods, though, require large amounts of annotated training data to create models that are accurate and robust to new flooded imagery. In this work, we provide FloodTrace, an application that enables effective crowdsourcing for flooded region annotation for machine learning training data, removing the requirement for annotation to be done solely by researchers. We accomplish this through two orthogonal methods within our application, informed by requirements from domain experts. First, we utilize elevation-guided annotation tools and 3D rendering to inform user annotation decisions with digital elevation model data, improving annotation accuracy. For this purpose, we provide a unique annotation method that uses topological data analysis to outperform the state-of-the-art elevation-guided annotation tool in efficiency. Second, we provide a framework for researchers to review aggregated crowdsourced annotations and correct inaccuracies using methods inspired by uncertainty visualization. We conducted a user study to confirm the application effectiveness in which 266 graduate students annotated high-resolution aerial imagery from Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina. Experimental results show the accuracy and efficiency benefits of our application apply even for untrained users. In addition, using our aggregation and correction framework, flood detection models trained on crowdsourced annotations were able to achieve performance equal to models trained on expert-labeled annotations, while requiring a fraction of the time on the part of the researcher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sejoon Oh, Moumita Bhattacharya, Yesu Feng, Sudarshan Lamkhede</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems have played a critical role in diverse digital services such as e-commerce, streaming media, social networks, etc. If we know what a user's intent is in a given session (e.g. do they want to watch short videos or a movie or play games; are they shopping for a camping trip), it becomes easier to provide high-quality recommendations. In this paper, we introduce IntentRec, a novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural network architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their short- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction to predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging the intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations to users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show that IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent predictors. We also share several findings and downstream applications of IntentRec.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lilin Xu, Keyi Wang, Chaojie Gu, Xiuzhen Guo, Shibo He, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been exploited for gesture recognition. However, existing mmWave-based gesture recognition methods cannot identify different users, which is important for ubiquitous gesture interaction in many applications. In this paper, we propose GesturePrint, which is the first to achieve gesture recognition and gesture-based user identification using a commodity mmWave radar sensor. GesturePrint features an effective pipeline that enables the gesture recognition system to identify users at a minor additional cost. By introducing an efficient signal preprocessing stage and a network architecture GesIDNet, which employs an attention-based multilevel feature fusion mechanism, GesturePrint effectively extracts unique gesture features for gesture recognition and personalized motion pattern features for user identification. We implement GesturePrint and collect data from 17 participants performing 15 gestures in a meeting room and an office, respectively. GesturePrint achieves a gesture recognition accuracy (GRA) of 98.87% with a user identification accuracy (UIA) of 99.78% in the meeting room, and 98.22% GRA with 99.26% UIA in the office. Extensive experiments on three public datasets and a new gesture dataset show GesturePrint's superior performance in enabling effective user identification for gesture recognition systems.</p>

Our approach integrates a new environmental formulation with a Profit and Loss (PnL)-based reward function, enhancing the RL agent's ability in downside risk management and capital optimization.

Tested over two 16-month periods of varying market volatility, the model significantly outperformed benchmarks, particularly in high-volatility scenarios, achieving higher return-to-risk ratios and demonstrating robust profitability. These results confirm the model's effectiveness in leveraging market dynamics and managing risks in volatile environments like the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantile regression is a powerful tool for robust and heterogeneous learning that has seen applications in a diverse range of applied areas. However, its broader application is often hindered by the substantial computational demands arising from the non-smooth quantile loss function. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named fastkqr, which significantly advances the computation of quantile regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The core of fastkqr is a finite smoothing algorithm that magically produces exact regression quantiles, rather than approximations. To further accelerate the algorithm, we equip fastkqr with a novel spectral technique that carefully reutilizes matrix computations. In addition, we extend fastkqr to accommodate a flexible kernel quantile regression with a data-driven crossing penalty, addressing the interpretability challenges of crossing quantile curves at multiple levels. We have implemented fastkqr in a publicly available R package. Extensive simulations and real applications show that fastkqr matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms but can operate up to an order of magnitude faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dantong Li, Dikshant Dulal, Mykhailo Ohorodnikov, Hanrui Wang, Yongshan Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) represent a promising paradigm for tackling challenges in quantum sensing, optimal control, optimization, and machine learning on near-term quantum hardware. Gradient-based methods are crucial for understanding the behavior of PQCs and have demonstrated substantial advantages in the convergence rates of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) compared to gradient-free methods. However, existing gradient estimation methods, such as Finite Difference, Parameter Shift Rule, Hadamard Test, and Direct Hadamard Test, often yield suboptimal gradient circuits for certain PQCs. To address these limitations, we introduce the Flexible Hadamard Test, which, when applied to first-order gradient estimation methods, can invert the roles of ansatz generators and observables. This inversion facilitates the use of measurement optimization techniques to efficiently compute PQC gradients. Additionally, to overcome the exponential cost of evaluating higher-order partial derivatives, we propose the $k$-fold Hadamard Test, which computes the $k^{th}$-order partial derivative using a single circuit. Furthermore, we introduce Quantum Automatic Differentiation (QAD), a unified gradient method that adaptively selects the best gradient estimation technique for individual parameters within a PQC. This represents the first implementation, to our knowledge, that departs from the conventional practice of uniformly applying a single method to all parameters. Through rigorous numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed first-order gradient methods, showing up to an $O(N)$ factor improvement in circuit execution count for real PQC applications. Our research contributes to the acceleration of VQA computations, offering practical utility in the NISQ era of quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Marfo, Pablo Moriano, Deepak K. Tosh, Shirley V. Moore</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern vehicles rely on a myriad of electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected via controller area networks (CANs) for critical operations. Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using only graph-based features. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses only graph-based features, as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p < 0.05).</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the practical problems and the lessons learned at short-video services from Kuaishou. In industry, a widely-used multi-task framework is the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, which always introduces some shared and specific experts for each task and then uses gate networks to measure related experts' contributions. Although the MoE achieves remarkable improvements, we still observe three anomalies that seriously affect model performances in our iteration: (1) Expert Collapse: We found that experts' output distributions are significantly different, and some experts have over 90% zero activations with ReLU, making it hard for gate networks to assign fair weights to balance experts. (2) Expert Degradation: Ideally, the shared-expert aims to provide predictive information for all tasks simultaneously. Nevertheless, we find that some shared-experts are occupied by only one task, which indicates that shared-experts lost their ability but degenerated into some specific-experts. (3) Expert Underfitting: In our services, we have dozens of behavior tasks that need to be predicted, but we find that some data-sparse prediction tasks tend to ignore their specific-experts and assign large weights to shared-experts. The reason might be that the shared-experts can perceive more gradient updates and knowledge from dense tasks, while specific-experts easily fall into underfitting due to their sparse behaviors. Motivated by those observations, we propose HoME to achieve a simple, efficient and balanced MoE system for multi-task learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the sample and computational complexity of completing a rank-1 tensor in $\otimes_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{R}^{d}$, given a uniformly sampled subset of its entries. We present a characterization of the problem (i.e. nonzero entries) which admits an algorithm amounting to Gauss-Jordan on a pair of random linear systems. For example, when $N = \Theta(1)$, we prove it uses no more than $m = O(d^2 \log d)$ samples and runs in $O(md^2)$ time. Moreover, we show any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\log d)$ samples.
  By contrast, existing upper bounds on the sample complexity are at least as large as $d^{1.5} \mu^{\Omega(1)} \log^{\Omega(1)} d$, where $\mu$ can be $\Theta(d)$ in the worst case. Prior work obtained these looser guarantees in higher rank versions of our problem, and tend to involve more complicated algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous quantum algorithms operate under the assumption that classical data has already been converted into quantum states, a process termed Quantum State Preparation (QSP). However, achieving precise QSP requires a circuit depth that scales exponentially with the number of qubits, making it a substantial obstacle in harnessing quantum advantage. Recent research suggests using a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) to approximate a target state, offering a more scalable solution with reduced circuit depth compared to precise QSP. Despite this, the need for iterative updates of circuit parameters results in a lengthy runtime, limiting its practical application. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to leverage a pre-trained neural network to directly generate the QSP circuit for arbitrary quantum state, thereby eliminating the significant overhead of online iterations. Our study makes a steady step towards a universal neural designer for approximate QSP.</p>

We propose a novel, easy-to-use approach to achieving high-quality representations that lead to adversarial robustness through the use of multi-resolution input representations and dynamic self-ensembling of intermediate layer predictions. We demonstrate that intermediate layer predictions exhibit inherent robustness to adversarial attacks crafted to fool the full classifier, and propose a robust aggregation mechanism based on Vickrey auction that we call \textit{CrossMax} to dynamically ensemble them. By combining multi-resolution inputs and robust ensembling, we achieve significant adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets without any adversarial training or extra data, reaching an adversarial accuracy of $\approx$72% (CIFAR-10) and $\approx$48% (CIFAR-100) on the RobustBench AutoAttack suite ($L_\infty=8/255)$ with a finetuned ImageNet-pretrained ResNet152. This represents a result comparable with the top three models on CIFAR-10 and a +5 % gain compared to the best current dedicated approach on CIFAR-100. Adding simple adversarial training on top, we get $\approx$78% on CIFAR-10 and $\approx$51% on CIFAR-100, improving SOTA by 5 % and 9 % respectively and seeing greater gains on the harder dataset. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and provide insights into the interplay between adversarial robustness, and the hierarchical nature of deep representations. We show that simple gradient-based attacks against our model lead to human-interpretable images of the target classes as well as interpretable image changes. As a byproduct, using our multi-resolution prior, we turn pre-trained classifiers and CLIP models into controllable image generators and develop successful transferable attacks on large vision language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Li, Gongyao Guo, Jieming Shi, Renchi Yang, Shiqi Shen, Qing Li, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Attributed networks containing entity-specific information in node attributes are ubiquitous in modeling social networks, e-commerce, bioinformatics, etc. Their inherent network topology ranges from simple graphs to hypergraphs with high-order interactions and multiplex graphs with separate layers. An important graph mining task is node clustering, aiming to partition the nodes of an attributed network into k disjoint clusters such that intra-cluster nodes are closely connected and share similar attributes, while inter-cluster nodes are far apart and dissimilar. It is highly challenging to capture multi-hop connections via nodes or attributes for effective clustering on multiple types of attributed networks. In this paper, we first present AHCKA as an efficient approach to attributed hypergraph clustering (AHC). AHCKA includes a carefully-crafted K-nearest neighbor augmentation strategy for the optimized exploitation of attribute information on hypergraphs, a joint hypergraph random walk model to devise an effective AHC objective, and an efficient solver with speedup techniques for the objective optimization. The proposed techniques are extensible to various types of attributed networks, and thus, we develop ANCKA as a versatile attributed network clustering framework, capable of attributed graph clustering (AGC), attributed multiplex graph clustering (AMGC), and AHC. Moreover, we devise ANCKA with algorithmic designs tailored for GPU acceleration to boost efficiency. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare our methods with 19 competitors on 8 attributed hypergraphs, 16 competitors on 6 attributed graphs, and 16 competitors on 3 attributed multiplex graphs, all demonstrating the superb clustering quality and efficiency of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Wei, Yang Wang, Kuofeng Gao, Shuo Shao, Yiming Li, Zhibo Wang, Zhan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, point clouds have been widely used in computer vision, whereas their collection is time-consuming and expensive. As such, point cloud datasets are the valuable intellectual property of their owners and deserve protection. To detect and prevent unauthorized use of these datasets, especially for commercial or open-sourced ones that cannot be sold again or used commercially without permission, we intend to identify whether a suspicious third-party model is trained on our protected dataset under the black-box setting. We achieve this goal by designing a scalable clean-label backdoor-based dataset watermark for point clouds that ensures both effectiveness and stealthiness. Unlike existing clean-label watermark schemes, which are susceptible to the number of categories, our method could watermark samples from all classes instead of only from the target one. Accordingly, it can still preserve high effectiveness even on large-scale datasets with many classes. Specifically, we perturb selected point clouds with non-target categories in both shape-wise and point-wise manners before inserting trigger patterns without changing their labels. The features of perturbed samples are similar to those of benign samples from the target class. As such, models trained on the watermarked dataset will have a distinctive yet stealthy backdoor behavior, i.e., misclassifying samples from the target class whenever triggers appear, since the trained DNNs will treat the inserted trigger pattern as a signal to deny predicting the target label. We also design a hypothesis-test-guided dataset ownership verification based on the proposed watermark. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential removal methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkyu Jeon, Rishwanth Raghu, Miro Astore, Geoffrey Woollard, Ryan Feathers, Alkin Kaz, Sonya M. Hanson, Pilar Cossio, Ellen D. Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. As this technique can capture dynamic biomolecular complexes, 3D reconstruction methods are increasingly being developed to resolve this intrinsic structural heterogeneity. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks with ground truth structures and validation metrics limits the advancement of the field. Here, we propose CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and performance benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. We propose five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from simple motions and random configurations of antibody complexes and from tens of thousands of structures sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation. We also design datasets containing compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states and 100 common complexes present in cells. We then perform a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools including neural and non-neural methods and their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative comparison of methods. We hope that this benchmark will be a foundational resource for analyzing existing methods and new algorithmic development in both the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toufique Ahmed, Premkumar Devanbu, Christoph Treude, Michael Pradel</p>
<p>Abstract: Experimental evaluations of software engineering innovations, e.g., tools and processes, often include human-subject studies as a component of a multi-pronged strategy to obtain greater generalizability of the findings. However, human-subject studies in our field are challenging, due to the cost and difficulty of finding and employing suitable subjects, ideally, professional programmers with varying degrees of experience. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have recently started to demonstrate human-level performance in several areas. This paper explores the possibility of substituting costly human subjects with much cheaper LLM queries in evaluations of code and code-related artifacts. We study this idea by applying six state-of-the-art LLMs to ten annotation tasks from five datasets created by prior work, such as judging the accuracy of a natural language summary of a method or deciding whether a code change fixes a static analysis warning. Our results show that replacing some human annotation effort with LLMs can produce inter-rater agreements equal or close to human-rater agreement. To help decide when and how to use LLMs in human-subject studies, we propose model-model agreement as a predictor of whether a given task is suitable for LLMs at all, and model confidence as a means to select specific samples where LLMs can safely replace human annotators. Overall, our work is the first step toward mixed human-LLM evaluations in software engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Qing</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional categorical data, often collected in psychological tests and educational assessments, are typically single-layer and gathered only once.This paper considers a more general case, multi-layer categorical data with polytomous responses. To model such data, we present a novel statistical model, the multi-layer latent class model (multi-layer LCM). This model assumes that all layers share common subjects and items. To discover subjects' latent classes and other model parameters under this model, we develop three efficient spectral methods based on the sum of response matrices, the sum of Gram matrices, and the debiased sum of Gram matrices, respectively. Within the framework of multi-layer LCM, we demonstrate the estimation consistency of these methods under mild conditions regarding data sparsity. Our theoretical findings reveal two key insights: (1) increasing the number of layers can enhance the performance of the proposed methods, highlighting the advantages of considering multiple layers in latent class analysis; (2) we theoretically show that the algorithm based on the debiased sum of Gram matrices usually performs best. Additionally, we propose an approach that combines the averaged modularity metric with our methods to determine the number of latent classes. Extensive experiments are conducted to support our theoretical results and show the powerfulness of our methods in the task of learning latent classes and estimating the number of latent classes in multi-layer categorical data with polytomous responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Patelli, Natalia Golini, Rosaria Ignaccolo, Michela Cameletti</p>
<p>Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used machine learning algorithm known for its flexibility, user-friendliness, and high predictive performance across various domains. However, it is non-interpretable. This can limit its usefulness in applied sciences, where understanding the relationships between predictors and response variable is crucial from a decision-making perspective. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to explain RF, but none of them addresses the challenge of explaining RF in the context of spatially dependent data. Therefore, this work aims to explain regression RF in the case of spatially dependent data by extracting a compact and simple list of rules. In this respect, we propose S-SIRUS, a spatial extension of SIRUS, the latter being a well-established regression rule algorithm able to extract a stable and short list of rules from the classical regression RF algorithm. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the explainability capability of the proposed S-SIRUS, in comparison to SIRUS, by considering different levels of spatial dependence among the data. The results suggest that S-SIRUS exhibits a higher test predictive accuracy than SIRUS when spatial correlation is present. Moreover, for higher levels of spatial correlation, S-SIRUS produces a shorter list of rules, easing the explanation of the mechanism behind the predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yisheng Yang, Guodong Du, Chean Khim Toa, Ho-Kin Tang, Sim Kuan Goh</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates neural network design by using optimization algorithms to navigate architecture spaces, reducing the burden of manual architecture design. While NAS has achieved success, applying it to emerging domains, such as analyzing unstructured 3D point clouds, remains underexplored due to the data lying in non-Euclidean spaces, unlike images. This paper presents Success-History-based Self-adaptive Differential Evolution with a Joint Point Interaction Dimension Search (SHSADE-PIDS), an evolutionary NAS framework that encodes discrete deep neural network architectures to continuous spaces and performs searches in the continuous spaces for efficient point cloud neural architectures. Comprehensive experiments on challenging 3D segmentation and classification benchmarks demonstrate SHSADE-PIDS's capabilities. It discovered highly efficient architectures with higher accuracy, significantly advancing prior NAS techniques. For segmentation on SemanticKITTI, SHSADE-PIDS attained 64.51% mean IoU using only 0.55M parameters and 4.5GMACs, reducing overhead by over 22-26X versus other top methods. For ModelNet40 classification, it achieved 93.4% accuracy with just 1.31M parameters, surpassing larger models. SHSADE-PIDS provided valuable insights into bridging evolutionary algorithms with neural architecture optimization, particularly for emerging frontiers like point cloud learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous robots consistently encounter unforeseen dangerous situations during exploration missions. The characteristic rimless wheels in the AsguardIV rover allow it to overcome challenging terrains. However, steep slopes or difficult maneuvers can cause the rover to tip over and threaten the completion of a mission. This work focuses on identifying early signs or initial stages for potential tip-over events to predict and detect these critical moments before they fully occur, possibly preventing accidents and enhancing the safety and stability of the rover during its exploration mission. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) readings are used to develop compact, robust, and efficient Autoencoders that combine the power of sequence processing of Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). By leveraging LSTM-based Autoencoders, this work contributes predictive capabilities for detecting tip-over risks and developing safety measures for more reliable exploration missions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vindula Jayawardana, Baptiste Freydt, Ao Qu, Cameron Hickert, Edgar Sanchez, Catherine Tang, Mark Taylor, Blaine Leonard, Cathy Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob K Christopher, Brian R Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Ferdinando Fioretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a widely adopted method to accelerate large language model inference without sacrificing the quality of the model outputs. While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, \textit{Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff)}, is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a \textbf{up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Geng, Zhiyi Shi, Xiaoyan Zhao, Alaa Ali, Jing Wang, Joseph Leader, Jiantao Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Abstract
  Background: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and computed tomography (CT) imaging are vital in diagnosing, managing, and monitoring lung diseases. A common issue in practice is the lack of access to recorded pulmonary functions despite available chest CT scans.
  Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm for predicting pulmonary function directly from chest CT scans.
  Methods: The development cohort came from the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study (PLuSS) (n=3619). The validation cohort came from the Specialized Centers of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCOR) in COPD (n=662). A deep learning model called BeyondCT, combining a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, was used to predict forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from non-contrasted inspiratory chest CT scans. A 3D CNN model without ViT was used for comparison. Subject demographics (age, gender, smoking status) were also incorporated into the model. Performance was compared to actual PFTs using mean absolute error (MAE, L), percentage error, and R square.
  Results: The 3D-CNN model achieved MAEs of 0.395 L and 0.383 L, percentage errors of 13.84% and 18.85%, and R square of 0.665 and 0.679 for FVC and FEV1, respectively. The BeyondCT model without demographics had MAEs of 0.362 L and 0.371 L, percentage errors of 10.89% and 14.96%, and R square of 0.719 and 0.727, respectively. Including demographics improved performance (p<0.05), with MAEs of 0.356 L and 0.353 L, percentage errors of 10.79% and 14.82%, and R square of 0.77 and 0.739 for FVC and FEV1 in the test set.
  Conclusion: The BeyondCT model showed robust performance in predicting lung function from non-contrast inspiratory chest CT scans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayak Saha Roy, Shirin Nilizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, an open-source, lightweight Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed for phishing website detection through contextual analysis of the website. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model utilizes the advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs to learn granular features that are characteristic of phishing attacks. Furthermore, PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified approximately 26K phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to aid current detection measures. We also evaluate PhishLang against several realistic adversarial attacks and develop six patches that make it very robust against such threats. Furthermore, we integrate PhishLang with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create \textit{explainable blocklisting} - warnings that provide users with contextual information about different features that led to a website being marked as phishing. Finally, we have open-sourced the PhishLang framework and developed a Chromium-based browser extension and URL scanner website, which implement explainable warnings for end-users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brett W. Larsen, Tamara G. Kolda, Anru R. Zhang, Alex H. Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: The canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition decomposes a multidimensional data array into a sum of outer products of finite-dimensional vectors. Instead, we can replace some or all of the vectors with continuous functions (infinite-dimensional vectors) from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We refer to tensors with some infinite-dimensional modes as quasitensors, and the approach of decomposing a tensor with some continuous RKHS modes is referred to as CP-HiFi (hybrid infinite and finite dimensional) tensor decomposition. An advantage of CP-HiFi is that it can enforce smoothness in the infinite dimensional modes. Further, CP-HiFi does not require the observed data to lie on a regular and finite rectangular grid and naturally incorporates misaligned data. We detail the methodology and illustrate it on a synthetic example.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Liu, Juncheng Jia, Hong Zhang, Yuhui Yun, Leye Wang, Yang Zhou, Huaiyu Dai, Dejing Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite achieving remarkable performance, Federated Learning (FL) encounters two important problems, i.e., low training efficiency and limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose a new FL framework, i.e., FedDUMAP, with three original contributions, to leverage the shared insensitive data on the server in addition to the distributed data in edge devices so as to efficiently train a global model. First, we propose a simple dynamic server update algorithm, which takes advantage of the shared insensitive data on the server while dynamically adjusting the update steps on the server in order to speed up the convergence and improve the accuracy. Second, we propose an adaptive optimization method with the dynamic server update algorithm to exploit the global momentum on the server and each local device for superior accuracy. Third, we develop a layer-adaptive model pruning method to carry out specific pruning operations, which is adapted to the diverse features of each layer so as to attain an excellent trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed FL model, FedDUMAP, combines the three original techniques and has a significantly better performance compared with baseline approaches in terms of efficiency (up to 16.9 times faster), accuracy (up to 20.4% higher), and computational cost (up to 62.6% smaller).</p>

This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for segmenting various organs from CT and MRI scans and classifying diseases. Our study introduces a novel technique integrating momentum within residual blocks for enhanced training dynamics in medical image analysis. We applied our method in two distinct tasks: segmenting liver, lung, & colon data and classifying abdominal pelvic CT and MRI scans. The proposed approach has shown promising results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on publicly available benchmarking datasets. For instance, in the lung segmentation dataset, our approach yielded significant enhancements over the TransNetR model, including a 5.72% increase in dice score, a 5.04% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), an 8.02% improvement in recall, and a 4.42% improvement in precision. Hence, incorporating momentum led to state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and classification tasks, representing a significant advancement in the field of medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungyeon Kim, Boseung Jeong, Donghyun Kim, Suha Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale image-text pre-trained models enable zero-shot classification and provide consistent accuracy across various data distributions. Nonetheless, optimizing these models in downstream tasks typically requires fine-tuning, which reduces generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data and demands extensive computational resources. We introduce Robust Adapter (R-Adapter), a novel method for fine-tuning zero-shot models to downstream tasks while simultaneously addressing both these issues. Our method integrates lightweight modules into the pre-trained model and employs novel self-ensemble techniques to boost OOD robustness and reduce storage expenses substantially. Furthermore, we propose MPM-NCE loss designed for fine-tuning on vision-language downstream tasks. It ensures precise alignment of multiple image-text pairs and discriminative feature learning. By extending the benchmark for robust fine-tuning beyond classification to include diverse tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and open vocabulary segmentation, we demonstrate the broad applicability of R-Adapter. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that R-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of tasks, tuning only 13% of the parameters of the CLIP encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoze Wang, Ronald W. Di Tullio, Spencer Rooke, Vijay Balasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixu Tao, Rajita Chandak, Sanjeev Kulkarni</p>
<p>Abstract: Data heterogeneity has been a long-standing bottleneck in studying the convergence rates of Federated Learning algorithms. In order to better understand the issue of data heterogeneity, we study the convergence rate of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the Federated Mixture of $K$ Linear Regressions model. We fully characterize the convergence rate of the EM algorithm under all regimes of $m/n$ where $m$ is the number of clients and $n$ is the number of data points per client. We show that with a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of order $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, the well-initialized EM algorithm converges within the minimax distance of the ground truth under each of the regimes. Interestingly, we identify that when $m$ grows exponentially in $n$, the EM algorithm only requires a constant number of iterations to converge. We perform experiments on synthetic datasets to illustrate our results. Surprisingly, the results show that rather than being a bottleneck, data heterogeneity can accelerate the convergence of federated learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eli Sennesh, Hao Wu, Tommaso Salvatori</p>
<p>Abstract: Unexpected stimuli induce "error" or "surprise" signals in the brain. The theory of predictive coding promises to explain these observations in terms of Bayesian inference by suggesting that the cortex implements variational inference in a probabilistic graphical model. However, when applied to machine learning tasks, this family of algorithms has yet to perform on par with other variational approaches in high-dimensional, structured inference problems. To address this, we introduce a novel predictive coding algorithm for structured generative models, that we call divide-and-conquer predictive coding (DCPC). DCPC differs from other formulations of predictive coding, as it respects the correlation structure of the generative model and provably performs maximum-likelihood updates of model parameters, all without sacrificing biological plausibility. Empirically, DCPC achieves better numerical performance than competing algorithms and provides accurate inference in a number of problems not previously addressed with predictive coding. We provide an open implementation of DCPC in Pyro on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Liu, Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Briol</p>
<p>Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance; since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected when the sample size is large enough. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is good enough for a specific task. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated by a distribution corresponding to our model up to some mild perturbation. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust according to common notions of robustness including qualitative and quantitative robustness. We also show that robust techniques based on tilted kernels from the parameter estimation literature are not sufficient for ensuring both types of robustness in the context of goodness-of-fit testing. We therefore propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test which resolves this open problem using kernel Stein discrepancy balls, which encompass perturbation models such as Huber contamination models and density uncertainty bands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renascence Tarafder Prapty, Ashish Kundu, Arun Iyengar</p>
<p>Abstract: As the complexity of modern systems increases, so does the importance of assessing their security posture through effective vulnerability management and threat modeling techniques. One powerful tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity professionals is the attack graph, a representation of all potential attack paths within a system that an adversary might exploit to achieve a certain objective. Traditional methods of generating attack graphs involve expert knowledge, manual curation, and computational algorithms that might not cover the entire threat landscape due to the ever-evolving nature of vulnerabilities and exploits. This paper explores the approach of leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to automate the generation of attack graphs by intelligently chaining Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on their preconditions and effects. It also shows how to utilize LLMs to create attack graphs from threat reports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffry Victor, Chunguang Wang, Sumeet K. Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Crossbar memory arrays have been touted as the workhorse of in-memory computing (IMC)-based acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), but the associated hardware non-idealities limit their efficacy. To address this, cross-layer design solutions that reduce the impact of hardware non-idealities on DNN accuracy are needed. In Part 1 of this paper, we established the co-optimization strategies for various memory technologies and their crossbar arrays, and conducted a comparative technology evaluation in the context of IMC robustness. In this part, we analyze various design knobs such as array size and bit-slice (number of bits per device) and their impact on the performance of 8T SRAM, ferroelectric transistor (FeFET), Resistive RAM (ReRAM) and spin-orbit-torque magnetic RAM (SOT-MRAM) in the context of inference accuracy at 7nm technology node. Further, we study the effect of circuit design solutions such as Partial Wordline Activation (PWA) and custom ADC reference levels that reduce the hardware non-idealities and comparatively analyze the response of each technology to such accuracy enhancing techniques. Our results on ResNet-20 (with CIFAR-10) show that PWA increases accuracy by up to 32.56% while custom ADC reference levels yield up to 31.62% accuracy enhancement. We observe that compared to the other technologies, FeFET, by virtue of its small layout height and high distinguishability of its memory states, is best suited for large arrays. For higher bit-slices and a more complex dataset (ResNet-50 with Cifar-100) we found that ReRAM matches the performance of FeFET.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans observe only part of their environment at any moment but can still make complex, long-term decisions thanks to our long-term memory system. To test how an AI can learn and utilize its long-term memory system, we have developed a partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) environment, where the agent has to answer questions while navigating a maze. The environment is completely knowledge graph (KG) based, where the hidden states are dynamic KGs. A KG is both human- and machine-readable, making it easy to see what the agents remember and forget. We train and compare agents with different memory systems, to shed light on how human brains work when it comes to managing its own memory systems. By repurposing the given learning objective as learning a memory management policy, we were able to capture the most likely belief state, which is not only interpretable but also reusable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Gholamian, Gianfranco Romani, Bartosz Rudnikowicz, Laura Skylaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Woo Cho, Seok Hyeon Hwang, Jun-Young Jang, Jin Yeong Song, Sun-kwang Hwang, Kyoung Je Cha, Dong Yong Park, Kyungjun Song, Sang Min Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Ventilated acoustic resonator(VAR), a type of acoustic metamaterial, emerge as an alternative for sound attenuation in environments that require ventilation, owing to its excellent low-frequency attenuation performance and flexible shape adaptability. However, due to the non-linear acoustic responses of VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized design space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical simulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and resources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational autoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design model for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with non-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic response with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent space, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR cross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates non-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold reduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based parameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error and peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE, multi-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency attenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural inverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational assistants necessitates dynamic, scalable, and configurable conversational datasets for training and evaluation. These datasets must accommodate diverse user interaction modes, including text and voice, each presenting unique modeling challenges. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured and evolving nature, offer an ideal foundation for current and precise knowledge. Although human-curated KG-based conversational datasets exist, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly changing user information needs. We present ConvKGYarn, a scalable method for generating up-to-date and configurable conversational KGQA datasets. Qualitative psychometric analyses confirm our method can generate high-quality datasets rivaling a popular conversational KGQA dataset while offering it at scale and covering a wide range of human-interaction configurations. We showcase its utility by testing LLMs on diverse conversations - exploring model behavior on conversational KGQA sets with different configurations grounded in the same KG fact set. Our results highlight the ability of ConvKGYarn to improve KGQA foundations and evaluate parametric knowledge of LLMs, thus offering a robust solution to the constantly evolving landscape of conversational assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Zhikun Zhang, Xiangjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional partial differential equations with constant coefficients often struggle to capture abrupt changes in real-world phenomena, leading to the development of variable coefficient PDEs and Markovian switching models. Recently, research has introduced the concept of PDEs with Markov switching models, established their well-posedness and presented numerical methods. However, there has been limited discussion on parameter estimation for the jump coefficients in these models. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on parameter inference for the wave equation with Markovian switching. We propose a Bayesian statistical framework using discrete sparse Bayesian learning to establish its convergence and a uniform error bound. Our method requires fewer assumptions and enables independent parameter inference for each segment by allowing different underlying structures for the parameter estimation problem within each segmented time interval. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through three numerical cases, which involve noisy spatiotemporal data from different wave equations with Markovian switching. The results show strong performance in parameter estimation for variable coefficient PDEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwen Mo, Lei Wang, Jianyu Wei, Zhichen Zeng, Shijie Cao, Lingxiao Ma, Naifeng Jing, Ting Cao, Jilong Xue, Fan Yang, Mao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language model (LLM) inference demands ever-greater resources, there is a rapid growing trend of using low-bit weights to shrink memory usage and boost inference efficiency. However, these low-bit LLMs introduce the need for mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), which is a crucial yet under-explored operation that involves multiplying lower-precision weights with higher-precision activations. Unfortunately, current hardware does not natively support mpGEMM, resulting in indirect and inefficient dequantization-based implementations.
  To address the mpGEMM requirements in low-bit LLMs, we explored the lookup table (LUT)-based approach for mpGEMM. However, a conventional LUT implementation falls short of its potential. To fully harness the power of LUT-based mpGEMM, we introduce LUT Tensor Core, a software-hardware co-design optimized for low-bit LLM inference. Specifically, we introduce software-based operator fusion and table symmetrization techniques to optimize table precompute and table storage, respectively. Then, LUT Tensor Core proposes the hardware design featuring an elongated tiling shape design to enhance table reuse and a bit-serial design to support various precision combinations in mpGEMM. Moreover, we design an end-to-end compilation stack with new instructions for LUT-based mpGEMM, enabling efficient LLM compilation and optimizations. The evaluation on low-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet, LLAMA) shows that LUT Tensor Core achieves more than a magnitude of improvements on both compute density and energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to their application in many challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs offer impressive generalization capabilities, understanding factors such as model prediction quality, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights can enable domain scientists to make informed decisions about their data. However, DNNs inherently lack ability to estimate prediction uncertainty, necessitating new research to construct robust uncertainty-aware visualization techniques tailored for various visualization tasks. In this work, we propose uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model scalar field data sets effectively and comprehensively study the efficacy and benefits of estimated uncertainty information for volume visualization tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout). These techniques enable uncertainty-informed volume visualization in scalar field data sets. Our extensive exploration across multiple data sets demonstrates that uncertainty-aware models produce informative volume visualization results. Moreover, integrating prediction uncertainty enhances the trustworthiness of our DNN model, making it suitable for robustly analyzing and visualizing real-world scientific volumetric data sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural network models have a complex architecture and are overparameterized. The number of parameters is more than the whole dataset, which is highly resource-consuming. This complicates their application and limits its usage on different devices. Reduction in the number of network parameters helps to reduce the size of the model, but at the same time, thoughtlessly applied, can lead to a deterioration in the quality of the network. One way to reduce the number of model parameters is matrix decomposition, where a matrix is represented as a product of smaller matrices. In this paper, we propose a new way of applying the matrix decomposition with respect to the weights of convolutional layers. The essence of the method is to train not all convolutions, but only the subset of convolutions (basis convolutions), and represent the rest as linear combinations of the basis ones. Experiments on models from the ResNet family and the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that basis convolutions can not only reduce the size of the model but also accelerate the forward and backward passes of the network. Another contribution of this work is that we propose a fast method for selecting a subset of network layers in which the use of matrix decomposition does not degrade the quality of the final model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Compared to other modalities, electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most focused tasks in affective computing. The nature of emotions is a physiological and psychological state change in response to brain region connectivity, making emotion recognition focus more on the dependency between brain regions instead of specific brain regions. A significant trend is the application of graphs to encapsulate such dependency as dynamic functional connections between nodes across temporal and spatial dimensions. Concurrently, the neuroscientific underpinnings behind this dependency endow the application of graphs in this field with a distinctive significance. However, there is neither a comprehensive review nor a tutorial for constructing emotion-relevant graphs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review of graph-related methods in this field from a methodological perspective. We propose a unified framework for graph applications in this field and categorize these methods on this basis. Finally, based on previous studies, we also present several open challenges and future directions in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiu-Chou Lin, Wei-Chen Chiu, I-Chen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Defining and measuring decision-making styles, also known as playstyles, is crucial in gaming, where these styles reflect a broad spectrum of individuality and diversity. However, finding a universally applicable measure for these styles poses a challenge. Building on Playstyle Distance, the first unsupervised metric to measure playstyle similarity based on game screens and raw actions, we introduce three enhancements to increase accuracy: multiscale analysis with varied state granularity, a perceptual kernel rooted in psychology, and the utilization of the intersection-over-union method for efficient evaluation. These innovations not only advance measurement precision but also offer insights into human cognition of similarity. Across two racing games and seven Atari games, our techniques significantly improve the precision of zero-shot playstyle classification, achieving an accuracy exceeding 90 percent with fewer than 512 observation-action pairs, which is less than half an episode of these games. Furthermore, our experiments with 2048 and Go demonstrate the potential of discrete playstyle measures in puzzle and board games. We also develop an algorithm for assessing decision-making diversity using these measures. Our findings improve the measurement of end-to-end game analysis and the evolution of artificial intelligence for diverse playstyles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Assion, Florens Gressner, Nitin Augustine, Jona Klemenc, Ahmed Hammam, Alexandre Krattinger, Holger Trittenbach, Sascha Riemer</p>
<p>Abstract: High-autonomy vehicle functions rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand the environment. Despite displaying remarkable performance in fair weather scenarios, perception algorithms are heavily affected by adverse weather and lighting conditions. To overcome these difficulties, ML engineers mainly rely on comprehensive real-world datasets. However, the difficulties in real-world data collection for critical areas of the operational design domain (ODD) often means synthetic data is required for perception training and safety validation. Thus, we present A-BDD, a large set of over 60,000 synthetically augmented images based on BDD100K that are equipped with semantic segmentation and bounding box annotations (inherited from the BDD100K dataset). The dataset contains augmented data for rain, fog, overcast and sunglare/shadow with varying intensity levels. We further introduce novel strategies utilizing feature-based image quality metrics like FID and CMMD, which help identify useful augmented and real-world data for ML training and testing. By conducting experiments on A-BDD, we provide evidence that data augmentations can play a pivotal role in closing performance gaps in adverse weather and lighting conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Haoxiang Liu, Feijun Jiang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for decision making problems leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods such as expert systems, planning algorithms, and reinforcement learning often exhibit limited generalization, typically requiring the training of new models for each unique task. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate remarkable success in generalizing across varied language tasks, inspiring a new strategy for training decision making models. Our approach, referred to as "Learning then Using" (LTU), entails a two-stage process. Initially, the \textit{learning} phase develops a robust foundational decision making model by integrating diverse knowledge from various domains and decision making contexts. The subsequent \textit{using} phase refines this foundation model for specific decision making scenarios. Distinct from other studies that employ LLMs for decision making through supervised learning, our LTU method embraces a versatile training methodology that combines broad pre-training with targeted fine-tuning. Experiments in e-commerce domains such as advertising and search optimization have shown that LTU approach outperforms traditional supervised learning regimes in decision making capabilities and generalization. The LTU approach is the first practical training architecture for both single-step and multi-step decision making tasks combined with LLMs, which can be applied beyond game and robot domains. It provides a robust and adaptable framework for decision making, enhances the effectiveness and flexibility of various systems in tackling various challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengwen Du, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Fairness testing for deep learning systems has been becoming increasingly important. However, much work assumes perfect context and conditions from the other parts: well-tuned hyperparameters for accuracy; rectified bias in data, and mitigated bias in the labeling. Yet, these are often difficult to achieve in practice due to their resource-/labour-intensive nature. Aims: In this paper, we aim to understand how varying contexts affect fairness testing outcomes. Method:We conduct an extensive empirical study, which covers $10,800$ cases, to investigate how contexts can change the fairness testing result at the model level against the existing assumptions. We also study why the outcomes were observed from the lens of correlation/fitness landscape analysis. Results: Our results show that different context types and settings generally lead to a significant impact on the testing, which is mainly caused by the shifts of the fitness landscape under varying contexts. Conclusions: Our findings provide key insights for practitioners to evaluate the test generators and hint at future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Halley Young, Yimeng Zeng, Jacob Gardner, Osbert Bastani</p>
<p>Abstract: The capability to generate diverse text is a key challenge facing large language models (LLMs). Thus far, diversity has been studied via metrics such as $n$-gram diversity or diversity of BERT embeddings. However, for these kinds of diversity, the user has little control over the dimensions along which diversity is considered. For example, in the poetry domain, one might desire diversity in terms of rhyme and meter, whereas in the code domain, one might desire diversity in terms of the kinds of expressions used to solve a problem. We propose a diversity metric called structural diversity, where the user provides a mapping from generated text to features capturing the kinds of diversity that they care about. In addition, we propose a novel strategy called chain-of-specification (CoS) prompting for improving diversity by first having the LLM generate a specification encoding one instance of structural features, and then prompting the LLM to generate text that satisfies these features; notably, our strategy works with blackbox LLMs. In our experiments, we show that for structural diversity in the poetry and code domains, CoS significantly improves diversity compared to several baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yorick Sens, Henriette Knopp, Sven Peldszus, Thorsten Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of machine learning (ML) and its embedding in systems has drastically changed the engineering of software-intensive systems. Traditionally, software engineering focuses on manually created artifacts such as source code and the process of creating them, as well as best practices for integrating them, i.e., software architectures. In contrast, the development of ML artifacts, i.e. ML models, comes from data science and focuses on the ML models and their training data. However, to deliver value to end users, these ML models must be embedded in traditional software, often forming complex topologies. In fact, ML-enabled software can easily incorporate many different ML models. While the challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied to some extent, beyond isolated examples, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems. Properly embedding ML models in systems so that they can be easily maintained or reused is far from trivial. We need to improve our empirical understanding of such systems, which we address by presenting the first large-scale study of real ML-enabled software systems, covering over 2,928 open source systems on GitHub. We classified and analyzed them to determine their characteristics, as well as their practices for reusing ML models and related code, and the architecture of these systems. Our findings provide practitioners and researchers with insight into practices for embedding and integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Song, Kennedy Odongo, Francis G. Pascual, Yili Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Photovoltaics (PV) are widely used to harvest solar energy, an important form of renewable energy. Photovoltaic arrays consist of multiple solar panels constructed from solar cells. Solar cells in the field are vulnerable to various defects, and electroluminescence (EL) imaging provides effective and non-destructive diagnostics to detect those defects. We use multiple traditional machine learning and modern deep learning models to classify EL solar cell images into different functional/defective categories. Because of the asymmetry in the number of functional vs. defective cells, an imbalanced label problem arises in the EL image data. The current literature lacks insights on which methods and metrics to use for model training and prediction. In this paper, we comprehensively compare different machine learning and deep learning methods under different performance metrics on the classification of solar cell EL images from monocrystalline and polycrystalline modules. We provide a comprehensive discussion on different metrics. Our results provide insights and guidelines for practitioners in selecting prediction methods and performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Rodemann, Christoph Jansen, Georg Schollmeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that a wide array of machine learning algorithms are specific instances of one single paradigm: reciprocal learning. These instances range from active learning over multi-armed bandits to self-training. We show that all these algorithms do not only learn parameters from data but also vice versa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on the current model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization of these algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to study under what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocal learning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In this way, we find that reciprocal learning algorithms converge at linear rates to an approximately optimal model under relatively mild assumptions on the loss function, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption is both non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret these findings and provide corollaries that relate them to specific active learning, self-training, and bandit algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amr Abdellatif, Xingcheng Chen, Vincenzo Riccio, Andrea Stocco</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the behavioral frontier of deep learning (DL) systems is crucial for understanding their generalizability and robustness. However, boundary testing is challenging due to their high-dimensional input space. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising solution by modeling data distribution within compact latent space representations, thereby facilitating finer-grained explorations. In this work, we introduce MIMICRY, a novel black-box system-agnostic test generator that leverages these latent representations to generate frontier inputs for the DL systems under test. Specifically, MIMICRY uses style-based generative adversarial networks trained to learn the representation of inputs with disentangled features. This representation enables embedding style-mixing operations between a source and a target input, combining their features to explore the boundary between them. We evaluated the effectiveness of different MIMICRY configurations in generating boundary inputs for four popular DL image classification systems. Our results show that manipulating the latent space allows for effective and efficient exploration of behavioral frontiers. As opposed to a model-based baseline, MIMICRY generates a higher quality frontier of behaviors which includes more and closer inputs. Additionally, we assessed the validity of these inputs, revealing a high validity rate according to human assessors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyi Shen, Renato Berlinghieri, Tamara Broderick</p>
<p>Abstract: Practitioners frequently aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. For instance, in single-cell sequencing, scientists would like to learn how gene expression evolves over time. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we cannot access any cell's full trajectory, but we can access snapshot samples from many cells. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to analyze systems with full individual-trajectory access; since here we have only sample snapshots, these methods are inapplicable. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions to estimate these dynamics. However, these methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic within the SB, which is often just set to be Brownian motion. But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. In particular, we suggest an iterative projection method inspired by Schr\"odinger bridges; we alternate between learning a piecewise SB on the unobserved trajectories and using the learned SB to refine our best guess for the dynamics within the reference class. We demonstrate the advantages of our method via a well-known simulated parametric model from ecology, simulated and real data from systems biology, and real motion-capture data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) enhance patient-physician communication, improve healthcare accessibility, and reduce costs. However, acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

We present GraphMetaMat, a graph-based framework capable of designing three-dimensional metamaterials with programmable responses and arbitrary manufacturing constraints. Integrating graph networks, physics biases, reinforcement learning, and tree search, GraphMetaMat can target stress-strain curves spanning four orders of magnitude and complex behaviors, as well as viscoelastic transmission responses with varying attenuation gaps. GraphMetaMat can create cushioning materials for protective equipment and vibration-damping panels for electric vehicles, outperforming commercial materials, and enabling the automatic design of materials with on-demand functionalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for machine learning algorithms applied to natural language processing and computer vision. Despite notable evidence of successful deployment of this architecture in the context of robot learning, we claim that vanilla transformers do not fully exploit the structure of the robot learning problem. Therefore, we propose Body Transformer (BoT), an architecture that leverages the robot embodiment by providing an inductive bias that guides the learning process. We represent the robot body as a graph of sensors and actuators, and rely on masked attention to pool information throughout the architecture. The resulting architecture outperforms the vanilla transformer, as well as the classical multilayer perceptron, in terms of task completion, scaling properties, and computational efficiency when representing either imitation or reinforcement learning policies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanan Chen, Ali Pesaranghader, Tanmana Sadhu, Dong Hoon Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought autonomous agents closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their promising generalization and emergent capabilities. There is, however, a lack of studies on how LLM-based agents behave, why they could potentially fail, and how to improve them, particularly in demanding real-world planning tasks. In this paper, as an effort to fill the gap, we present our study using a realistic benchmark, TravelPlanner, where an agent must meet multiple constraints to generate accurate plans. We leverage this benchmark to address four key research questions: (1) are LLM agents robust enough to lengthy and noisy contexts when it comes to reasoning and planning? (2) can few-shot prompting adversely impact the performance of LLM agents in scenarios with long context? (3) can we rely on refinement to improve plans, and (4) can fine-tuning LLMs with both positive and negative feedback lead to further improvement? Our comprehensive experiments indicate that, firstly, LLMs often fail to attend to crucial parts of a long context, despite their ability to handle extensive reference information and few-shot examples; secondly, they still struggle with analyzing the long plans and cannot provide accurate feedback for refinement; thirdly, we propose Feedback-Aware Fine-Tuning (FAFT), which leverages both positive and negative feedback, resulting in substantial gains over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our findings offer in-depth insights to the community on various aspects related to real-world planning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores humor detection through a linguistic lens, prioritizing syntactic, semantic, and contextual features over computational methods in Natural Language Processing. We categorize features into syntactic, semantic, and contextual dimensions, including lexicons, structural statistics, Word2Vec, WordNet, and phonetic style. Our proposed model, Colbert, utilizes BERT embeddings and parallel hidden layers to capture sentence congruity. By combining syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, we train Colbert for humor detection. Feature engineering examines essential syntactic and semantic features alongside BERT embeddings. SHAP interpretations and decision trees identify influential features, revealing that a holistic approach improves humor detection accuracy on unseen data. Integrating linguistic cues from different dimensions enhances the model's ability to understand humor complexity beyond traditional computational methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binchi Zhang, Minnan Luo, Shangbin Feng, Ziqi Liu, Jun Zhou, Qinghua Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has become an important research topic in response to the increasing scale and the distributed nature of graph-structured data in the real world. In FGL, a global graph is distributed across different clients, where each client holds a subgraph. Existing FGL methods often fail to effectively utilize cross-client edges, losing structural information during the training; additionally, local graphs often exhibit significant distribution divergence. These two issues make local models in FGL less desirable than in centralized graph learning, namely the local bias problem in this paper. To solve this problem, we propose a novel FGL framework to make the local models similar to the model trained in a centralized setting. Specifically, we design a distributed learning scheme, fully leveraging cross-client edges to aggregate information from other clients. In addition, we propose a label-guided sampling approach to alleviate the imbalanced local data and meanwhile, distinctly reduce the training overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that local bias can compromise the model performance and slow down the convergence during training. Experimental results also verify that our framework successfully mitigates local bias, achieving better performance than other baselines with lower time and memory overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Value-based reinforcement-learning algorithms have shown strong results in games, robotics, and other real-world applications. Overestimation bias is a known threat to those algorithms and can sometimes lead to dramatic performance decreases or even complete algorithmic failure. We frame the bias problem statistically and consider it an instance of estimating the maximum expected value (MEV) of a set of random variables. We propose the $T$-Estimator (TE) based on two-sample testing for the mean, that flexibly interpolates between over- and underestimation by adjusting the significance level of the underlying hypothesis tests. We also introduce a generalization, termed $K$-Estimator (KE), that obeys the same bias and variance bounds as the TE and relies on a nearly arbitrary kernel function. We introduce modifications of $Q$-Learning and the Bootstrapped Deep $Q$-Network (BDQN) using the TE and the KE, and prove convergence in the tabular setting. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive variant of the TE-based BDQN that dynamically adjusts the significance level to minimize the absolute estimation bias. All proposed estimators and algorithms are thoroughly tested and validated on diverse tasks and environments, illustrating the bias control and performance potential of the TE and KE.</p>

<p>Abstract: In model-based reinforcement learning (RL), an agent can leverage a learned model to improve its way of behaving in different ways. Two of the prevalent ways to do this are through decision-time and background planning methods. In this study, we are interested in understanding how the value-based versions of these two planning methods will compare against each other across different settings. Towards this goal, we first consider the simplest instantiations of value-based decision-time and background planning methods and provide theoretical results on which one will perform better in the regular RL and transfer learning settings. Then, we consider the modern instantiations of them and provide hypotheses on which one will perform better in the same settings. Finally, we perform illustrative experiments to validate these theoretical results and hypotheses. Overall, our findings suggest that even though value-based versions of the two planning methods perform on par in their simplest instantiations, the modern instantiations of value-based decision-time planning methods can perform on par or better than the modern instantiations of value-based background planning methods in both the regular RL and transfer learning settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop an extension of posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) that is suited for a continuing agent-environment interface and integrates naturally into agent designs that scale to complex environments. The approach, continuing PSRL, maintains a statistically plausible model of the environment and follows a policy that maximizes expected $\gamma$-discounted return in that model. At each time, with probability $1-\gamma$, the model is replaced by a sample from the posterior distribution over environments. For a choice of discount factor that suitably depends on the horizon $T$, we establish an $\tilde{O}(\tau S \sqrt{A T})$ bound on the Bayesian regret, where $S$ is the number of environment states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $\tau$ denotes the reward averaging time, which is a bound on the duration required to accurately estimate the average reward of any policy. Our work is the first to formalize and rigorously analyze the resampling approach with randomized exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nesryne Mejri, Laura Lopez-Fuentes, Kankana Roy, Pavel Chernakov, Enjie Ghorbel, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series has been extensively investigated in the literature. Notwithstanding the relevance of this topic in numerous application fields, a comprehensive and extensive evaluation of recent state-of-the-art techniques taking into account real-world constraints is still needed. Some efforts have been made to compare existing unsupervised time-series anomaly detection methods rigorously. However, only standard performance metrics, namely precision, recall, and F1-score are usually considered. Essential aspects for assessing their practical relevance are therefore neglected. This paper proposes an in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance metrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into account. In particular, (i) more elaborate performance metrics specifically tailored for time-series are used; (ii) the model size and the model stability are studied; (iii) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the anomaly type is provided; and (iv) a clear and unique protocol is followed for all experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity of state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding their applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more complete evaluation protocol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saket Tiwari, Omer Gottesman, George Konidaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning have led to its successful application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens. Central to our work is the idea that the transition dynamics induce a low dimensional manifold of reachable states embedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space. We prove that, under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is at most the dimensionality of the action space plus one. This is the first result of its kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo environments. We further demonstrate the applicability of our result by learning a policy in this low dimensional representation. To do so we introduce an algorithm that learns a mapping to a low dimensional representation, as a narrow hidden layer of a deep neural network, in tandem with the policy using DDPG. Our experiments show that a policy learnt this way perform on par or better for four MuJoCo control suite tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current AI-assisted protein design mainly utilizes protein sequential and structural information. Meanwhile, there exists tremendous knowledge curated by humans in the text format describing proteins' high-level functionalities. Yet, whether the incorporation of such text data can help protein design tasks has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modal framework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design. ProteinDT consists of three subsequent steps: ProteinCLAP which aligns the representation of two modalities, a facilitator that generates the protein representation from the text modality, and a decoder that creates the protein sequences from the representation. To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset, SwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We quantitatively verify the effectiveness of ProteinDT on three challenging tasks: (1) over 90\% accuracy for text-guided protein generation; (2) best hit ratio on 12 zero-shot text-guided protein editing tasks; (3) superior performance on four out of six protein property prediction benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Mandal, Seo Taek Kong, Dimitrios Katselis, R. Srikant</p>
<p>Abstract: The Dawid-Skene model is the most widely assumed model in the analysis of crowdsourcing algorithms that estimate ground-truth labels from noisy worker responses. In this work, we are motivated by crowdsourcing applications where workers have distinct skill sets and their accuracy additionally depends on a task's type. While weighted majority vote (WMV) with a single weight vector for each worker achieves the optimal label estimation error in the Dawid-Skene model, we show that different weights for different types are necessary for a multi-type model. Focusing on the case where there are two types of tasks, we propose a spectral method to partition tasks into two groups that cluster tasks by type. Our analysis reveals that task types can be perfectly recovered if the number of workers $n$ scales logarithmically with the number of tasks $d$. Any algorithm designed for the Dawid-Skene model can then be applied independently to each type to infer the labels. Numerical experiments show how clustering tasks by type before estimating ground-truth labels enhances the performance of crowdsourcing algorithms in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinbin Han, Meisam Razaviyayn, Renyuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonlinear control systems with partial information to the decision maker are prevalent in a variety of applications. As a step toward studying such nonlinear systems, this work explores reinforcement learning methods for finding the optimal policy in the nearly linear-quadratic regulator systems. In particular, we consider a dynamic system that combines linear and nonlinear components, and is governed by a policy with the same structure. Assuming that the nonlinear component comprises kernels with small Lipschitz coefficients, we characterize the optimization landscape of the cost function. Although the cost function is nonconvex in general, we establish the local strong convexity and smoothness in the vicinity of the global optimizer. Additionally, we propose an initialization mechanism to leverage these properties. Building on the developments, we design a policy gradient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal policy with a linear rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giovanni S. Alberti, Johannes Hertrich, Matteo Santacesaria, Silvia Sciutto</p>
<p>Abstract: Representing a manifold of very high-dimensional data with generative models has been shown to be computationally efficient in practice. However, this requires that the data manifold admits a global parameterization. In order to represent manifolds of arbitrary topology, we propose to learn a mixture model of variational autoencoders. Here, every encoder-decoder pair represents one chart of a manifold. We propose a loss function for maximum likelihood estimation of the model weights and choose an architecture that provides us the analytical expression of the charts and of their inverses. Once the manifold is learned, we use it for solving inverse problems by minimizing a data fidelity term restricted to the learned manifold. To solve the arising minimization problem we propose a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm on the learned manifold. We demonstrate the performance of our method for low-dimensional toy examples as well as for deblurring and electrical impedance tomography on certain image manifolds.</p>

Active learning is done with query by committee, where the Pareto frontier of equations is the committee. The physical constraints improve proposed equations in very low data settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonis Matakos, Bruno Ordozgoiti, Suhas Thejaswi</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of column subset selection asks for a subset of columns from an input matrix such that the matrix can be reconstructed as accurately as possible within the span of the selected columns. A natural extension is to consider a setting where the matrix rows are partitioned into two groups, and the goal is to choose a subset of columns that minimizes the maximum reconstruction error of both groups, relative to their respective best rank-k approximation. Extending the known results of column subset selection to this fair setting is not straightforward: in certain scenarios it is unavoidable to choose columns separately for each group, resulting in double the expected column count. We propose a deterministic leverage-score sampling strategy for the fair setting and show that sampling a column subset of minimum size becomes NP-hard in the presence of two groups. Despite these negative results, we give an approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within 1.5 times the optimal solution size. We also present practical heuristic algorithms based on rank-revealing QR factorization. Finally, we validate our methods through an extensive set of experiments using real-world data.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06909">Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Decentralized Communications Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Liu, Wenshan Li, Tao Li, Beibei Li, Guangquan Xu, Pan Zhou, Wengang Ma, Hanyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Ma, Fei Zhu, Zhen Cheng, Xu-Yao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiency and trustworthiness are two eternal pursuits when applying deep learning in real-world applications. With regard to efficiency, dataset distillation (DD) endeavors to reduce training costs by distilling the large dataset into a tiny synthetic dataset. However, existing methods merely concentrate on in-distribution (InD) classification in a closed-world setting, disregarding out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. On the other hand, OOD detection aims to enhance models' trustworthiness, which is always inefficiently achieved in full-data settings. For the first time, we simultaneously consider both issues and propose a novel paradigm called Trustworthy Dataset Distillation (TrustDD). By distilling both InD samples and outliers, the condensed datasets are capable of training models competent in both InD classification and OOD detection. To alleviate the requirement of real outlier data, we further propose to corrupt InD samples to generate pseudo-outliers, namely Pseudo-Outlier Exposure (POE). Comprehensive experiments on various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of TrustDD, and POE surpasses the state-of-the-art method Outlier Exposure (OE). Compared with the preceding DD, TrustDD is more trustworthy and applicable to open-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/mashijie1028/TrustDD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Hai Nguyen, Tetsuya Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a general optimization problem of minimizing a composite objective functional defined over a class of probability distributions. The objective is composed of two functionals: one is assumed to possess the variational representation and the other is expressed in terms of the expectation operator of a possibly nonsmooth convex regularizer function. Such a regularized distributional optimization problem widely appears in machine learning and statistics, such as proximal Monte-Carlo sampling, Bayesian inference and generative modeling, for regularized estimation and generation.
  We propose a novel method, dubbed as Moreau-Yoshida Variational Transport (MYVT), for solving the regularized distributional optimization problem. First, as the name suggests, our method employs the Moreau-Yoshida envelope for a smooth approximation of the nonsmooth function in the objective. Second, we reformulate the approximate problem as a concave-convex saddle point problem by leveraging the variational representation, and then develope an efficient primal-dual algorithm to approximate the saddle point. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analyses and report experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Radek Svoboda, Sebastian Basterrech, Jedrzej Kozal, Jan Platos, Michal Wozniak</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting natural gas consumption, considering seasonality and trends, is crucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost of obtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats to its supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this raw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy security. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of natural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model collection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream processing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed approach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas consumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting models and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point detection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a different model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model collection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are defined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of detected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic baseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a lower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure employed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting forecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for continual learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The state of the art for physical hazard prediction from weather and climate requires expensive km-scale numerical simulations driven by coarser resolution global inputs. Here, a generative diffusion architecture is explored for downscaling such global inputs to km-scale, as a cost-effective machine learning alternative. The model is trained to predict 2km data from a regional weather model over Taiwan, conditioned on a 25km global reanalysis. To address the large resolution ratio, different physics involved at different scales and prediction of channels beyond those in the input data, we employ a two-step approach where a UNet predicts the mean and a corrector diffusion (CorrDiff) model predicts the residual. CorrDiff exhibits encouraging skill in bulk MAE and CRPS scores. The predicted spectra and distributions from CorrDiff faithfully recover important power law relationships in the target data. Case studies of coherent weather phenomena show that CorrDiff can help sharpen wind and temperature gradients that co-locate with intense rainfall in cold front, and can help intensify typhoons and synthesize rain band structures. Calibration of model uncertainty remains challenging. The prospect of unifying methods like CorrDiff with coarser resolution global weather models implies a potential for global-to-regional multi-scale machine learning simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Gruver, Marc Finzi, Shikai Qiu, Andrew Gordon Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ProNet, an novel deep learning approach designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting, adaptively blending autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) strategies. Our method involves dividing the forecasting horizon into segments, predicting the most crucial steps in each segment non-autoregressively, and the remaining steps autoregressively. The segmentation process relies on latent variables, which effectively capture the significance of individual time steps through variational inference. In comparison to AR models, ProNet showcases remarkable advantages, requiring fewer AR iterations, resulting in faster prediction speed, and mitigating error accumulation. On the other hand, when compared to NAR models, ProNet takes into account the interdependency of predictions in the output space, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing four large datasets, and an ablation study, demonstrate the effectiveness of ProNet, highlighting its superior performance in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, outperforming state-of-the-art AR and NAR forecasting models.</p>

<p>Abstract: To advance quality assurance in the welding process, this study presents a deep learning DL model that enables the prediction of two critical welds' Key Performance Characteristics (KPCs): welding depth and average pore volume. In the proposed approach, a wide range of laser welding Key Input Characteristics (KICs) is utilized, including welding beam geometries, welding feed rates, path repetitions for weld beam geometries, and bright light weld ratios for all paths, all of which were obtained from hairpin welding experiments. Two DL networks are employed with multiple hidden dense layers and linear activation functions to investigate the capabilities of deep neural networks in capturing the complex nonlinear relationships between the welding input and output variables (KPCs and KICs). Applying DL networks to the small numerical experimental hairpin welding dataset has shown promising results, achieving Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values 0.1079 for predicting welding depth and 0.0641 for average pore volume. This, in turn, promises significant advantages in controlling welding outcomes, moving beyond the current trend of relying only on defect classification in weld monitoring, to capture the correlation between the weld parameters and weld geometries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> MohammadReza Davari, Eugene Belilovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of AI systems has been greatly influenced by the emergence of foundation models. A common approach for targeted problems involves fine-tuning these pre-trained foundation models for specific target tasks, resulting in a rapid spread of models fine-tuned across a diverse array of tasks. This work focuses on the problem of merging multiple fine-tunings of the same foundation model derived from a spectrum of auxiliary tasks. We introduce a new simple method, Model Breadcrumbs, which consists of a sparsely defined weight set that guides model adaptation within the weight space of a pre-trained model. These breadcrumbs are constructed by subtracting the weights from a pre-trained model before and after fine-tuning, followed by a sparsification process that eliminates weight outliers and negligible perturbations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Model Breadcrumbs to simultaneously improve performance across multiple tasks. This contribution aligns with the evolving paradigm of updatable machine learning, reminiscent of the collaborative principles underlying open-source software development, fostering a community-driven effort to reliably update machine learning models. Our method is shown to be more efficient and unlike previous proposals does not require hyperparameter tuning for each new task added. Through extensive experimentation involving various models, tasks, and modalities we establish that integrating Model Breadcrumbs offers a simple, efficient, and highly effective approach for constructing multi-task models and facilitating updates to foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The universal approximation theorem states that a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate continuous functions on compact sets with any desired precision. This theorem supports using neural networks for various applications, including regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, it is valid for real-valued neural networks and some hypercomplex-valued neural networks such as complex-, quaternion-, tessarine-, and Clifford-valued neural networks. However, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are a type of vector-valued neural network defined on an algebra with additional algebraic or geometric properties. This paper extends the universal approximation theorem for a wide range of vector-valued neural networks, including hypercomplex-valued models as particular instances. Precisely, we introduce the concept of non-degenerate algebra and state the universal approximation theorem for neural networks defined on such algebras.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) allows models to be trained in a privacy-preserving manner, but has proven difficult to scale to the era of foundation models. We introduce DP-ZO, a private fine-tuning framework for large language models by privatizing zeroth order optimization methods. A key insight into the design of our method is that the direction of the gradient in the zeroth-order optimization we use is random and the only information from training data is the step size, i.e., a scalar. Therefore, we only need to privatize the scalar step size, which is memory-efficient. DP-ZO provides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different tasks, and model sizes that are comparable to DP-SGD in $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP. Notably, DP-ZO possesses significant advantages over DP-SGD in memory efficiency, and obtains higher utility in $\varepsilon$-DP when using the Laplace mechanism.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many emerging applications, such as robot-assisted eldercare and object recognition, generally employ deep learning neural networks (DNNs) and require the deployment of DNN models on edge devices. These applications naturally require i) handling streaming-in inference requests and ii) fine-tuning the deployed models to adapt to possible deployment scenario changes. Continual learning (CL) is widely adopted to satisfy these needs. CL is a popular deep learning paradigm that handles both continuous model fine-tuning and overtime inference requests. However, an inappropriate model fine-tuning scheme could involve significant redundancy and consume considerable time and energy, making it challenging to apply CL on edge devices. In this paper, we propose ETuner, an efficient edge continual learning framework that optimizes inference accuracy, fine-tuning execution time, and energy efficiency through both inter-tuning and intra-tuning optimizations. Experimental results show that, on average, ETuner reduces overall fine-tuning execution time by 64%, energy consumption by 56%, and improves average inference accuracy by 1.75% over the immediate model fine-tuning approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Insu Choi, Woosung Koh, Gimin Kang, Yuntae Jang, Woo Chang Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling time series data remains a pervasive issue as the temporal dimension is inherent to numerous domains. Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelong Li, Wenyue Hua, Hao Wang, He Zhu, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Yan, Saurabh Agarwal, Shivaram Venkataraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative Decoding is a widely used technique to speed up inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing quality. When performing inference, speculative decoding uses a smaller draft model to generate speculative tokens and then uses the target LLM to verify those draft tokens. The speedup provided by speculative decoding heavily depends on the choice of the draft model. In this work, we perform a detailed study comprising over 350 experiments with LLaMA-65B and OPT-66B using speculative decoding and delineate the factors that affect the performance gain provided by speculative decoding. Our experiments indicate that the performance of speculative decoding depends heavily on the latency of the draft model, and the draft model's capability in language modeling does not correlate strongly with its performance in speculative decoding. Based on these insights we explore a new design space for draft models and design hardware-efficient draft models for speculative decoding. Our newly designed draft model for LLaMA-65B can provide 111% higher throughput than existing draft models and can generalize further to the LLaMA-2 model family and supervised fine-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna L. Trella, Walter Dempsey, Finale Doshi-Velez, Susan A. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationary rewards. We present a novel formulation of non-stationarity in the environment where changes in the mean reward of the arms over time are due to some unknown, latent, auto-regressive (AR) state of order $k$. We call this new environment the latent AR bandit. Different forms of the latent AR bandit appear in many real-world settings, especially in emerging scientific fields such as behavioral health or education where there are few mechanistic models of the environment. If the AR order $k$ is known, we propose an algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(k\sqrt{T})$ regret in this setting. Empirically, our algorithm outperforms standard UCB across multiple non-stationary environments, even if $k$ is mis-specified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxiao Zhao, Xueying Ding, Lijun Yu, Leman Akoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have seen a surge of attention with applications on naturally discrete data such as language and graphs. Although discrete-time discrete diffusion has been established for a while, only recently Campbell et al. (2022) introduced the first framework for continuous-time discrete diffusion. However, their training and sampling processes differ significantly from the discrete-time version, necessitating nontrivial approximations for tractability. In this paper, we first present a series of mathematical simplifications of the variational lower bound that enable more accurate and easy-to-optimize training for discrete diffusion. In addition, we derive a simple formulation for backward denoising that enables exact and accelerated sampling, and importantly, an elegant unification of discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion. Thanks to simpler analytical formulations, both forward and now also backward probabilities can flexibly accommodate any noise distribution, including different noise distributions for multi-element objects. Experiments show that our proposed USD3 (for Unified Simplified Discrete Denoising Diffusion) outperform all SOTA baselines on established datasets. We open-source our unified code at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/USD3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Zhang, Shaoan Xie, Ignavier Ng, Yujia Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the latent causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the latent causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, most latent variables can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongzhi Zhang, Zhiping Peng, Junhao Zheng, Qianli Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to solve CQA by performing multi-hop logical reasoning. However, most of them cannot perform well on both one-hop and multi-hop queries simultaneously. Recent work proposes a logical message passing mechanism based on the pre-trained neural link predictors. While effective on both one-hop and multi-hop queries, it ignores the difference between the constant and variable nodes in a query graph. In addition, during the node embedding update stage, this mechanism cannot dynamically measure the importance of different messages, and whether it can capture the implicit logical dependencies related to a node and received messages remains unclear. In this paper, we propose Conditional Logical Message Passing Transformer (CLMPT), which considers the difference between constants and variables in the case of using pre-trained neural link predictors and performs message passing conditionally on the node type. We empirically verified that this approach can reduce computational costs without affecting performance. Furthermore, CLMPT uses the transformer to aggregate received messages and update the corresponding node embedding. Through the self-attention mechanism, CLMPT can assign adaptive weights to elements in an input set consisting of received messages and the corresponding node and explicitly model logical dependencies between various elements. Experimental results show that CLMPT is a new state-of-the-art neural CQA model. https://github.com/qianlima-lab/CLMPT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms offer great potential for personalizing treatment for participants in clinical trials. However, deploying an online, autonomous algorithm in the high-stakes healthcare setting makes quality control and data quality especially difficult to achieve. This paper proposes algorithm fidelity as a critical requirement for deploying online RL algorithms in clinical trials. It emphasizes the responsibility of the algorithm to (1) safeguard participants and (2) preserve the scientific utility of the data for post-trial analyses. We also present a framework for pre-deployment planning and real-time monitoring to help algorithm developers and clinical researchers ensure algorithm fidelity. To illustrate our framework's practical application, we present real-world examples from the Oralytics clinical trial. Since Spring 2023, this trial successfully deployed an autonomous, online RL algorithm to personalize behavioral interventions for participants at risk for dental disease.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00013">Prioritizing Informative Features and Examples for Deep Learning from Noisy Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongmin Park</p>
<p>Abstract: In this dissertation, we propose a systemic framework that prioritizes informative features and examples to enhance each stage of the development process. Specifically, we prioritize informative features and examples and improve the performance of feature learning, data labeling, and data selection. We first propose an approach to extract only informative features that are inherent to solving a target task by using auxiliary out-of-distribution data. We deactivate the noise features in the target distribution by using that in the out-of-distribution data. Next, we introduce an approach that prioritizes informative examples from unlabeled noisy data in order to reduce the labeling cost of active learning. In order to solve the purity-information dilemma, where an attempt to select informative examples induces the selection of many noisy examples, we propose a meta-model that finds the best balance between purity and informativeness. Lastly, we suggest an approach that prioritizes informative examples from labeled noisy data to preserve the performance of data selection. For labeled image noise data, we propose a data selection method that considers the confidence of neighboring samples to maintain the performance of the state-of-the-art Re-labeling models. For labeled text noise data, we present an instruction selection method that takes diversity into account for ranking the quality of instructions with prompting, thereby enhancing the performance of aligned large language models.
  Overall, our unified framework induces the deep learning development process robust to noisy data, thereby effectively mitigating noisy features and examples in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Zhao, Yi Jing, Fuli Feng, Jiancan Wu, Chongming Gao, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Medication recommendation systems have gained significant attention in healthcare as a means of providing tailored and effective drug combinations based on patients' clinical information. However, existing approaches often suffer from fairness issues, as recommendations tend to be more accurate for patients with common diseases compared to those with rare conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Robust and Accurate REcommendations for Medication (RAREMed), which leverages the pretrain-finetune learning paradigm to enhance accuracy for rare diseases. RAREMed employs a transformer encoder with a unified input sequence approach to capture complex relationships among disease and procedure codes. Additionally, it introduces two self-supervised pre-training tasks, namely Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) and Self Reconstruction (SR), to learn specialized medication needs and interrelations among clinical codes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that RAREMed provides accurate drug sets for both rare and common disease patients, thereby mitigating unfairness in medication recommendation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Norris, Aswin Chari, Dorien van Blooijs, Gerald Cooray, Karl Friston, Martin Tisdall, Richard Rosch</p>
<p>Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, often requiring surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying epileptogenic areas. Our study advances the application of deep learning for SOZ localisation using Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses, with two key contributions. Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare two SPES analysis paradigms: divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate outward and inward effective connections, respectively. We assess the generalisability of these models to unseen patients and electrode placements using held-out test sets. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC: 0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNN Transformers with cross-channel attention in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing the AUROC to 0.730. These findings represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep learning research and practical healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Dong, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.29$\times$ and 1.25$\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B, respectively, on an NVIDIA L40).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Sch\"one, Neeraj Mohan Sushma, Jingyue Zhuge, Christian Mayr, Anand Subramoney, David Kappel</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based sensors are well suited for real-time processing due to their fast response times and encoding of the sensory data as successive temporal differences. These and other valuable properties, such as a high dynamic range, are suppressed when the data is converted to a frame-based format. However, most current methods either collapse events into frames or cannot scale up when processing the event data directly event-by-event. In this work, we address the key challenges of scaling up event-by-event modeling of the long event streams emitted by such sensors, which is a particularly relevant problem for neuromorphic computing. While prior methods can process up to a few thousand time steps, our model, based on modern recurrent deep state-space models, scales to event streams of millions of events for both training and inference.We leverage their stable parameterization for learning long-range dependencies, parallelizability along the sequence dimension, and their ability to integrate asynchronous events effectively to scale them up to long event streams.We further augment these with novel event-centric techniques enabling our model to match or beat the state-of-the-art performance on several event stream benchmarks. In the Spiking Speech Commands task, we improve state-of-the-art by a large margin of 6.6% to 87.1%. On the DVS128-Gestures dataset, we achieve competitive results without using frames or convolutional neural networks. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to use fully event-based processing with purely recurrent networks to achieve state-of-the-art task performance in several event-based benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yipeng Zhang, Laurent Charlin, Richard Zemel, Mengye Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: We formulate a unifying framework for unsupervised continual learning (UCL), which disentangles learning objectives that are specific to the present and the past data, encompassing stability, plasticity, and cross-task consolidation. The framework reveals that many existing UCL approaches overlook cross-task consolidation and try to balance plasticity and stability in a shared embedding space. This results in worse performance due to a lack of within-task data diversity and reduced effectiveness in learning the current task. Our method, Osiris, which explicitly optimizes all three objectives on separate embedding spaces, achieves state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks, including two novel benchmarks proposed in this paper featuring semantically structured task sequences. Compared to standard benchmarks, these two structured benchmarks more closely resemble visual signals received by humans and animals when navigating real-world environments. Finally, we show some preliminary evidence that continual models can benefit from such realistic learning scenarios.</p>

First, the deep learning component extracts temporal features from industrial data, combining and transforming them into a higher-level data representation. Second, the machine learning component processes and classifies the features extracted in the first step.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Alnegheimish, Linh Nguyen, Laure Berti-Equille, Kalyan Veeramachaneni</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengnan Li, Yunxiao Qin, Xilong Cheng, Yuting Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series data can be represented in both the time and frequency domains, with the time domain emphasizing local dependencies and the frequency domain highlighting global dependencies. To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer). To exploit the global characteristics of the frequency domain, we introduce the Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, designed to capture global inter-series dependencies. Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</p>

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed at identifying and rectifying unfaithfulness in TimeSieve.

<p>Abstract: Limited by the complexity of basis function (B-spline) calculations, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) suffer from restricted parallel computing capability on GPUs. This paper proposes a novel ReLU-KAN implementation that inherits the core idea of KAN. By adopting ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and point-wise multiplication, we simplify the design of KAN's basis function and optimize the computation process for efficient CUDA computing. The proposed ReLU-KAN architecture can be readily implemented on existing deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for both inference and training. Experimental results demonstrate that ReLU-KAN achieves a 20x speedup compared to traditional KAN with 4-layer networks. Furthermore, ReLU-KAN exhibits a more stable training process with superior fitting ability while preserving the "catastrophic forgetting avoidance" property of KAN.

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Nehma, Madhur Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dou Hu, Lingwei Wei, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic representation learning framework, named conditional information flow maximization, to extract noise-invariant sufficient representations for the input data and target task. It promotes the learned representations have good feature uniformity and sufficient predictive ability, which can enhance the generalization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for the target task. Firstly, an information flow maximization principle is proposed to learn more sufficient representations for the input and target by simultaneously maximizing both input-representation and representation-label mutual information. Unlike the information bottleneck, we handle the input-representation information in an opposite way to avoid the over-compression issue of latent representations. Besides, to mitigate the negative effect of potential redundant features from the input, we design a conditional information minimization principle to eliminate negative redundant features while preserve noise-invariant features. Experiments on 13 language understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively improves the performance of PLMs for classification and regression. Extensive experiments show that the learned representations are more sufficient, robust and transferable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Feder Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: To develop rigorous knowledge about ML models -- and the systems in which they are embedded -- we need reliable measurements. But reliable measurement is fundamentally challenging, and touches on issues of reproducibility, scalability, uncertainty quantification, epistemology, and more. This dissertation addresses criteria needed to take reliability seriously: both criteria for designing meaningful metrics, and for methodologies that ensure that we can dependably and efficiently measure these metrics at scale and in practice. In doing so, this dissertation articulates a research vision for a new field of scholarship at the intersection of machine learning, law, and policy. Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different themes: (1) quantifying and mitigating sources of arbitrariness in ML, (2) taming randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in order to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability, and (3) providing methods for evaluating generative-AI systems, with specific focuses on quantifying memorization in language models and training latent diffusion models on open-licensed data. By making contributions in these three themes, this dissertation serves as an empirical proof by example that research on reliable measurement for machine learning is intimately and inescapably bound up with research in law and policy. These different disciplines pose similar research questions about reliable measurement in machine learning. They are, in fact, two complementary sides of the same research vision, which, broadly construed, aims to construct machine-learning systems that cohere with broader societal values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Italo Serramazza, Thach Le Nguyen, Georgiana Ifrim</p>
<p>Abstract: Explanation for Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is an important topic that is under explored. There are very few quantitative evaluation methodologies and even fewer examples of actionable explanation, where the explanation methods are shown to objectively improve specific computational tasks on time series data. In this paper we focus on analyzing InterpretTime, a recent evaluation methodology for attribution methods applied to MTSC. We showcase some significant weaknesses of the original methodology and propose ideas to improve both its accuracy and efficiency. Unlike related work, we go beyond evaluation and also showcase the actionability of the produced explainer ranking, by using the best attribution methods for the task of channel selection in MTSC. We find that perturbation-based methods such as SHAP and Feature Ablation work well across a set of datasets, classifiers and tasks and outperform gradient-based methods. We apply the best ranked explainers to channel selection for MTSC and show significant data size reduction and improved classifier accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchi Yang, Murat Yildirim, Qiu Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: In distributed machine learning, efficient training across multiple agents with different data distributions poses significant challenges. Even with a centralized coordinator, current algorithms that achieve optimal communication complexity typically require either large minibatches or compromise on gradient complexity. In this work, we tackle both centralized and decentralized settings across strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex objectives. We first demonstrate that a basic primal-dual method, (Accelerated) Gradient Ascent Multiple Stochastic Gradient Descent (GA-MSGD), applied to the Lagrangian of distributed optimization inherently incorporates local updates, because the inner loops of running Stochastic Gradient Descent on the primal variable require no inter-agent communication. Notably, for strongly convex objectives, (Accelerated) GA-MSGD achieves linear convergence in communication rounds despite the Lagrangian being only linear in the dual variables. This is due to a structural property where the dual variable is confined to the span of the coupling matrix, rendering the dual problem strongly concave. When integrated with the Catalyst framework, our approach achieves nearly optimal communication complexity across various settings without the need for minibatches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianliang Xu, Ting Du, Wang Kong, Ye Li, Zhongyi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization algorithms are crucial in training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), as unsuitable methods may lead to poor solutions. Compared to the common gradient descent (GD) algorithm, implicit gradient descent (IGD) outperforms it in handling certain multi-scale problems. In this paper, we provide convergence analysis for the IGD in training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs. We first demonstrate the positive definiteness of Gram matrices for some general smooth activation functions, such as sigmoidal function, softplus function, tanh function, and others. Then, over-parameterization allows us to prove that the randomly initialized IGD converges a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate. Moreover, due to the distinct training dynamics of IGD compared to GD, the learning rate can be selected independently of the sample size and the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix. Additionally, the novel approach used in our convergence analysis imposes a milder requirement on the network width. Finally, empirical results validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Sikar, Artur Garcez, Robin Bloomfield, Tillman Weyde, Kaleem Peeroo, Naman Singh, Maeve Hutchinson, Dany Laksono, Mirela Reljan-Delaney</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Misclassification Likelihood Matrix (MLM) as a novel tool for quantifying the reliability of neural network predictions under distribution shifts. The MLM is obtained by leveraging softmax outputs and clustering techniques to measure the distances between the predictions of a trained neural network and class centroids. By analyzing these distances, the MLM provides a comprehensive view of the model's misclassification tendencies, enabling decision-makers to identify the most common and critical sources of errors. The MLM allows for the prioritization of model improvements and the establishment of decision thresholds based on acceptable risk levels. The approach is evaluated on the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a perturbed version of the dataset to simulate distribution shifts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLM in assessing the reliability of predictions and highlight its potential in enhancing the interpretability and risk mitigation capabilities of neural networks. The implications of this work extend beyond image classification, with ongoing applications in autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, to improve the safety and reliability of decision-making in complex, real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Musleh Alharthi, Ausif Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based models have gained prominence in multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), demonstrating significant advancements despite facing challenges such as high computational demands, difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics, and managing long-term dependencies. The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation~(LoRA), which updates the dense neural network layers with pluggable low-rank matrices, is one of the best performed parameter efficient fine-tuning paradigms. Furthermore, it has significant advantages in cross-task generalization and privacy-preserving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Razmara, Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh, B. Keith Jenkins</p>
<p>Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the necessity for advanced diagnostic tools in global health systems. Infrared Thermography (IRT) has proven to be a crucial non-contact method for measuring body temperature, vital for identifying febrile conditions associated with infectious diseases like COVID-19. Traditional non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) often exhibit significant variability in readings. To address this, we integrated machine learning algorithms with IRT to enhance the accuracy and reliability of temperature measurements. Our study systematically evaluated various regression models using heuristic feature engineering techniques, focusing on features' physiological relevance and statistical significance. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, utilizing these techniques, achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.2223, demonstrating superior performance compared to results reported in previous literature. Among non-neural network models, the Binning method achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 0.2296. Our findings highlight the potential of combining advanced feature engineering with machine learning to improve diagnostic tools' effectiveness, with implications extending to other non-contact or remote sensing biomedical applications. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of these methodologies, providing a foundation for future research in the field of non-invasive medical diagnostics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuyu Zhu, Liheng Hu, Sijin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the face of complex natural images, existing deep clustering algorithms fall significantly short in terms of clustering accuracy when compared to supervised classification methods, making them less practical. This paper introduces an image clustering algorithm based on self-supervised pretrained models and latent feature distribution optimization, substantially enhancing clustering performance. It is found that: (1) For complex natural images, we effectively enhance the discriminative power of latent features by leveraging self-supervised pretrained models and their fine-tuning, resulting in improved clustering performance. (2) In the latent feature space, by searching for k-nearest neighbor images for each training sample and shortening the distance between the training sample and its nearest neighbor, the discriminative power of latent features can be further enhanced, and clustering performance can be improved. (3) In the latent feature space, reducing the distance between sample features and the nearest predefined cluster centroids can optimize the distribution of latent features, therefore further improving clustering performance. Through experiments on multiple datasets, our approach outperforms the latest clustering algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art clustering results. When the number of categories in the datasets is small, such as CIFAR-10 and STL-10, and there are significant differences between categories, our clustering algorithm has similar accuracy to supervised methods without using pretrained models, slightly lower than supervised methods using pre-trained models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Quadir, M. Tanveer</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiview learning (MVL) seeks to leverage the benefits of diverse perspectives to complement each other, effectively extracting and utilizing the latent information within the dataset. Several twin support vector machine-based MVL (MvTSVM) models have been introduced and demonstrated outstanding performance in various learning tasks. However, MvTSVM-based models face significant challenges in the form of computational complexity due to four matrix inversions, the need to reformulate optimization problems in order to employ kernel-generated surfaces for handling non-linear cases, and the constraint of uniform noise assumption in the training data. Particularly in cases where the data possesses a heteroscedastic error structure, these challenges become even more pronounced. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose multiview twin parametric margin support vector machine (MvTPMSVM). MvTPMSVM constructs parametric margin hyperplanes corresponding to both classes, aiming to regulate and manage the impact of the heteroscedastic noise structure existing within the data. The proposed MvTPMSVM model avoids the explicit computation of matrix inversions in the dual formulation, leading to enhanced computational efficiency. We perform an extensive assessment of the MvTPMSVM model using benchmark datasets such as UCI, KEEL, synthetic, and Animals with Attributes (AwA). Our experimental results, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed MvTPMSVM model compared to the baseline models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel N. Nissani (Nissensohn)</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has been successfully applied to classification and other downstream tasks related to concrete concepts, such as objects contained in the ImageNet dataset. No attempts seem to have been made so far in applying this promising scheme to more abstract entities. A prominent example of these could be the concept of (discrete) Quantity. CL can be frequently interpreted as a self-supervised scheme guided by some profound and ubiquitous conservation principle (e.g. conservation of identity in object classification tasks). In this introductory work we apply a suitable conservation principle to the semi-abstract concept of natural numbers by which discrete quantities can be estimated or predicted. We experimentally show, by means of a toy problem, that contrastive learning can be trained to count at a glance with high accuracy both at human as well as at super-human ranges.. We compare this with the results of a trained-to-count at a glance supervised learning (SL) neural network scheme of similar architecture. We show that both schemes exhibit similar good performance on baseline experiments, where the distributions of the training and testing stages are equal. Importantly, we demonstrate that in some generalization scenarios, where training and testing distributions differ, CL boasts more robust and much better error performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Holland, Chandra Thapa, Sarah Ali Siddiqui, Wei Shao, Seyit Camtepe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large machine-learning training datasets can be distilled into small collections of informative synthetic data samples. These synthetic sets support efficient model learning and reduce the communication cost of data sharing. Thus, high-fidelity distilled data can support the efficient deployment of machine learning applications in distributed network environments. A naive way to construct a synthetic set in a distributed environment is to allow each client to perform local data distillation and to merge local distillations at a central server. However, the quality of the resulting set is impaired by heterogeneity in the distributions of the local data held by clients. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the first collaborative data distillation technique, called CollabDM, which captures the global distribution of the data and requires only a single round of communication between client and server. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art one-shot learning method on skewed data in distributed learning environments. We also show the promising practical benefits of our method when applied to attack detection in 5G networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data science, and similarity graph-based clustering is an important approach within this domain. Doubly stochastic symmetric similarity graphs provide numerous benefits for clustering problems and downstream tasks, yet learning such graphs remains a significant challenge. Marcus theorem states that a strictly positive symmetric matrix can be transformed into a doubly stochastic symmetric matrix by diagonal matrices. However, in clustering, learning sparse matrices is crucial for computational efficiency. We extend Marcus theorem by proposing the Marcus mapping, which indicates that certain sparse matrices can also be transformed into doubly stochastic symmetric matrices via diagonal matrices. Additionally, we introduce rank constraints into the clustering problem and propose the Doubly Stochastic Adaptive Neighbors Clustering algorithm based on the Marcus Mapping (ANCMM). This ensures that the learned graph naturally divides into the desired number of clusters. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we explore the relationship between the Marcus mapping and optimal transport. We prove that the Marcus mapping solves a specific type of optimal transport problem and demonstrate that solving this problem through Marcus mapping is more efficient than directly applying optimal transport methods.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02936">Achieving More with Less: A Tensor-Optimization-Powered Ensemble Method</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghui Yuan, Weijin Jiang, Zhe Cao, Fangyuan Xie, Rong Wang, Feiping Nie, Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble learning is a method that leverages weak learners to produce a strong learner. However, obtaining a large number of base learners requires substantial time and computational resources. Therefore, it is meaningful to study how to achieve the performance typically obtained with many base learners using only a few. We argue that to achieve this, it is essential to enhance both classification performance and generalization ability during the ensemble process. To increase model accuracy, each weak base learner needs to be more efficiently integrated. It is observed that different base learners exhibit varying levels of accuracy in predicting different classes. To capitalize on this, we introduce confidence tensors $\tilde{\mathbf{\Theta}}$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{\Theta}}_{rst}$ signifies the degree of confidence that the $t$-th base classifier assigns the sample to class $r$ while it actually belongs to class $s$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an evaluation of the performance of base classifiers across different classes has been proposed. The proposed confidence tensor compensates for the strengths and weaknesses of each base classifier in different classes, enabling the method to achieve superior results with a smaller number of base learners. To enhance generalization performance, we design a smooth and convex objective function that leverages the concept of margin, making the strong learner more discriminative. Furthermore, it is proved that in gradient matrix of the loss function, the sum of each column's elements is zero, allowing us to solve a constrained optimization problem using gradient-based methods. We then compare our algorithm with random forests of ten times the size and other classical methods across numerous datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shawn Im, Yixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking. This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses on overparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent of the training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound the generalization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, under specific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferred responses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunseung Chung, Sumin Jo, Yeonsu Kwon, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the massive attention given to time-series explanations due to their extensive applications, a notable limitation in existing approaches is their primary reliance on the time-domain. This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to "plug-in" various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucian Beznea, Iulian Cimpean, Oana Lupascu-Stamate, Ionel Popescu, Arghir Zarnescu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we study probabilistic and neural network approximations for solutions to Poisson equation subject to Holder data in general bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We aim at two fundamental goals.
  The first, and the most important, we show that the solution to Poisson equation can be numerically approximated in the sup-norm by Monte Carlo methods, and that this can be done highly efficiently if we use a modified version of the walk on spheres algorithm as an acceleration method. This provides estimates which are efficient with respect to the prescribed approximation error and with polynomial complexity in the dimension and the reciprocal of the error. A crucial feature is that the overall number of samples does not not depend on the point at which the approximation is performed.
  As a second goal, we show that the obtained Monte Carlo solver renders in a constructive way ReLU deep neural network (DNN) solutions to Poisson problem, whose sizes depend at most polynomialy in the dimension $d$ and in the desired error. In fact we show that the random DNN provides with high probability a small approximation error and low polynomial complexity in the dimension.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art deep networks are all powered by backpropagation. In this paper, we explore alternatives to full backpropagation in the form of blockwise learning rules, leveraging the latest developments in self-supervised learning. We show that a blockwise pretraining procedure consisting of training independently the 4 main blocks of layers of a ResNet-50 with Barlow Twins' loss function at each block performs almost as well as end-to-end backpropagation on ImageNet: a linear probe trained on top of our blockwise pretrained model obtains a top-1 classification accuracy of 70.48%, only 1.1% below the accuracy of an end-to-end pretrained network (71.57% accuracy). We perform extensive experiments to understand the impact of different components within our method and explore a variety of adaptations of self-supervised learning to the blockwise paradigm, building an exhaustive understanding of the critical avenues for scaling local learning rules to large networks, with implications ranging from hardware design to neuroscience.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04353">Exponentially improved efficient machine learning for quantum many-body states with provable guarantees</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanming Che, Clemens Gneiting, Franco Nori</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving the ground state and the ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems is generically a hard task for classical algorithms. For a family of Hamiltonians defined on an $m$-dimensional space of physical parameters, the ground state and its properties at an arbitrary parameter configuration can be predicted via a machine learning protocol up to a prescribed prediction error $\varepsilon$, provided that a sample set (of size $N$) of the states can be efficiently prepared and measured. In a recent work [Huang et al., Science 377, eabk3333 (2022)], a rigorous guarantee for such a generalization was proved. Unfortunately, an exponential scaling for the provable sample complexity, $N=m^{{\cal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$, was found to be universal for generic gapped Hamiltonians. This result applies to the situation where the dimension of the parameter space is large while the scaling with the accuracy is not an urgent factor. In this work, we consider an alternative scenario where $m$ is a finite, not necessarily large constant while the scaling with the prediction error becomes the central concern. By jointly preserving the fundamental properties of density matrices in the learning protocol and utilizing the continuity of quantum states in the parameter range of interest, we rigorously obtain a polynomial sample complexity for predicting quantum many-body states and their properties, with respect to the uniform prediction error $\varepsilon$ and the number of qubits $n$. Moreover, if restricted to learning local quantum-state properties, the number of samples with respect to $n$ can be further reduced exponentially. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for efficient learning of quantum many-body states and their properties, with model-independent applications not restricted to ground states of gapped Hamiltonians.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keumgang Cha, Junghoon Seo, Taekyung Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weifeng Chen, Yatai Ji, Jie Wu, Hefeng Wu, Pan Xie, Jiashi Li, Xin Xia, Xuefeng Xiao, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled impressive image generation capabilities guided by text prompts. However, extending these techniques to video generation remains challenging, with existing text-to-video (T2V) methods often struggling to produce high-quality and motion-consistent videos. In this work, we introduce Control-A-Video, a controllable T2V diffusion model that can generate videos conditioned on text prompts and reference control maps like edge and depth maps. To tackle video quality and motion consistency issues, we propose novel strategies to incorporate content prior and motion prior into the diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we employ a first-frame condition scheme to transfer video generation from the image domain. Additionally, we introduce residual-based and optical flow-based noise initialization to infuse motion priors from reference videos, promoting relevance among frame latents for reduced flickering. Furthermore, we present a Spatio-Temporal Reward Feedback Learning (ST-ReFL) algorithm that optimizes the video diffusion model using multiple reward models for video quality and motion consistency, leading to superior outputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality, more consistent videos compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in controllable text-to-video generation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezheng Song, Maria K. Cameron, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states $A$ and $B$. Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state $B$ prior to $A$ from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolai Merkel, Daniel Stoll, Ruben Mayer, Hans-Arno Jacobsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained much attention as a growing area of deep learning capable of learning on graph-structured data. However, the computational and memory requirements for training GNNs on large-scale graphs make it necessary to distribute the training. A prerequisite for distributed GNN training is to partition the input graph into smaller parts that are distributed among multiple machines of a compute cluster. Although graph partitioning has been studied with regard to graph analytics and graph databases, its effect on GNN training performance is largely unexplored. As a consequence, it is unclear whether investing computational efforts into high-quality graph partitioning would pay off in GNN training scenarios.
  In this paper, we study the effectiveness of graph partitioning for distributed GNN training. Our study aims to understand how different factors such as GNN parameters, mini-batch size, graph type, features size, and scale-out factor influence the effectiveness of graph partitioning. We conduct experiments with two different GNN systems using vertex and edge partitioning. We found that high-quality graph partitioning is a very effective optimization to speed up GNN training and to reduce memory consumption. Furthermore, our results show that invested partitioning time can quickly be amortized by reduced GNN training time, making it a relevant optimization for most GNN scenarios. Compared to research on distributed graph processing, our study reveals that graph partitioning plays an even more significant role in distributed GNN training, which motivates further research on the graph partitioning problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Koo, Minhwa Lee, Vipul Raheja, Jong Inn Park, Zae Myung Kim, Dongyeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Dongsheng Li, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: In long context scenarios, large language models (LLMs) face three main challenges: higher computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias. Research indicates that LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for prompt compression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information to simultaneously address the three challenges. Our extensive evaluation across various long context scenarios demonstrates that LongLLMLingua not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces costs and latency. For instance, in the NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua boosts performance by up to 21.4% with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo, leading to substantial cost savings. It achieves a 94.0% cost reduction in the LooGLE benchmark. Moreover, when compressing prompts of about 10k tokens at ratios of 2x-6x, LongLLMLingua can accelerate end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.6x.

<p>Abstract: Counterfactuals answer questions of what would have been observed under altered circumstances and can therefore offer valuable insights. Whereas the classical interventional interpretation of counterfactuals has been studied extensively, backtracking constitutes a less studied alternative where all causal laws are kept intact. In the present work, we introduce a practical method called deep backtracking counterfactuals (DeepBC) for computing backtracking counterfactuals in structural causal models that consist of deep generative components. We propose two distinct versions of our method--one utilizing Langevin Monte Carlo sampling and the other employing constrained optimization--to generate counterfactuals for high-dimensional data. As a special case, our formulation reduces to methods in the field of counterfactual explanations. Compared to these, our approach represents a causally compliant, versatile and modular alternative. We demonstrate these properties experimentally on a modified version of MNIST and CelebA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pourya Behmandpoor, Marc Moonen, Panagiotis Patrinos</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local rewards or a global reward, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global reward equal to aggregated local rewards) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local reward). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., reward function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Wiedemann, Reinhard Heckel</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryogenic electron tomography is a technique for imaging biological samples in 3D. A microscope collects a series of 2D projections of the sample, and the goal is to reconstruct the 3D density of the sample called the tomogram. Reconstruction is difficult as the 2D projections are noisy and can not be recorded from all directions, resulting in a missing wedge of information. Tomograms conventionally reconstructed with filtered back-projection suffer from noise and strong artifacts due to the missing wedge. Here, we propose a deep-learning approach for simultaneous denoising and missing wedge reconstruction called DeepDeWedge. The algorithm requires no ground truth data and is based on fitting a neural network to the 2D projections using a self-supervised loss. DeepDeWedge is simpler than current state-of-the-art approaches for denoising and missing wedge reconstruction, performs competitively and produces more denoised tomograms with higher overall contrast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amr Gomaa, Bilal Mahdy, Niko Kleer, Antonio Kr\"uger</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot-assisted surgical systems have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing surgical precision and minimizing human errors. However, existing systems cannot accommodate individual surgeons' unique preferences and requirements. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries (e.g., laparoscopy) and are unsuitable for highly precise microsurgeries, such as ophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose an image-guided approach for surgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to the individual surgeon's skill level and preferred surgical techniques during ophthalmic cataract surgery. Our approach trains reinforcement and imitation learning agents simultaneously using curriculum learning approaches guided by image data to perform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating the surgeon's actions and preferences into the training process, our approach enables the robot to implicitly learn and adapt to the individual surgeon's unique techniques through surgeon-in-the-loop demonstrations. This results in a more intuitive and personalized surgical experience for the surgeon while ensuring consistent performance for the autonomous robotic apprentice. We define and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated environment using our proposed metrics and highlight the trade-off between a generic agent and a surgeon-centered adapted agent. Finally, our approach has the potential to extend to other ophthalmic and microsurgical procedures, opening the door to a new generation of surgeon-in-the-loop autonomous surgical robots.

<p>Abstract: Although In-Context Learning (ICL) brings remarkable performance gains to Large Language Models (LLMs), the improvements remain lower than fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This paper introduces Multi-Modal In-Context Tuning (MMICT), a novel multi-modal fine-tuning paradigm that boosts multi-modal fine-tuning by fully leveraging the promising ICL capability of multi-modal LLMs (MM-LLMs). We propose the Multi-Modal Hub (M-Hub), a unified module that captures various multi-modal features according to different inputs and objectives. Based on M-Hub, MMICT enables MM-LLMs to learn from in-context visual-guided textual features and subsequently generate outputs conditioned on the textual-guided visual features. Moreover, leveraging the flexibility of M-Hub, we design a variety of in-context demonstrations. Extensive experiments on a diverse range of downstream multi-modal tasks demonstrate that MMICT significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning strategy and the vanilla ICT method that directly takes the concatenation of all information from different modalities as input.

<p>Abstract: Metamaterials with functional responses, such as wave-based responses or deformation-induced property variation under external stimuli, can exhibit varying properties or functionalities under different conditions. Herein, we aim at rapid inverse design of these metamaterials to meet target qualitative functional behaviors. This inverse problem is challenging due to its intractability and the existence of non-unique solutions. Past works mainly focus on deep-learning-based methods that are data-demanding, require time-consuming training and hyperparameter tuning, and are non-interpretable. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Random-forest-based Interpretable Generative Inverse Design (RIGID), an iteration-free, single-shot inverse design method to achieve the fast generation of metamaterial designs with on-demand functional behaviors. Unlike most existing methods, by exploiting the interpretability of the random forest, we eliminate the need to train an inverse model mapping responses to designs. Based on the likelihood of target satisfaction derived from the trained forward model, one can sample design solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The RIGID method therefore functions as a generative model that captures the conditional distribution of satisfying solutions given a design target. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RIGID on both acoustic and optical metamaterial design problems where only small datasets (less than 250 training samples) are available. Synthetic design problems are created to further illustrate and validate the mechanism of likelihood estimation in RIGID. This work offers a new perspective on solving on-demand inverse design problems, showcasing the potential for incorporating interpretable machine learning into generative design and eliminating its large data requirement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Th\'eriault, Daniele Tantari</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense Hopfield networks are known for their feature to prototype transition and adversarial robustness. However, previous theoretical studies have been mostly concerned with their storage capacity. We bridge this gap by studying the phase diagram of p-body Hopfield networks in the teacher-student setting of an unsupervised learning problem, uncovering ferromagnetic phases reminiscent of the prototype and feature learning regimes. On the Nishimori line, we find the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive tolerance to noise. We then derive a closed-form expression measuring the adversarial robustness of such a student at zero temperature, corroborating the positive correlation between number of parameters and robustness observed in large neural networks. We also use our model to clarify why the prototype phase of modern Hopfield networks is adversarially robust.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Partha Ghosh, Soubhik Sanyal, Cordelia Schmid, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel unconditional video generative model designed to address long-term spatial and temporal dependencies, with attention to computational and dataset efficiency. To capture long spatio-temporal dependencies, our approach incorporates a hybrid explicit-implicit tri-plane representation inspired by 3D-aware generative frameworks developed for three-dimensional object representation and employs a single latent code to model an entire video clip. Individual video frames are then synthesized from an intermediate tri-plane representation, which itself is derived from the primary latent code. This novel strategy more than halves the computational complexity measured in FLOPs compared to the most efficient state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, our approach facilitates the efficient and temporally coherent generation of videos. Moreover, our joint frame modeling approach, in contrast to autoregressive methods, mitigates the generation of visual artifacts. We further enhance the model's capabilities by integrating an optical flow-based module within our Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generator architecture, thereby compensating for the constraints imposed by a smaller generator size. As a result, our model synthesizes high-fidelity video clips at a resolution of $256\times256$ pixels, with durations extending to more than $5$ seconds at a frame rate of 30 fps. The efficacy and versatility of our approach are empirically validated through qualitative and quantitative assessments across three different datasets comprising both synthetic and real video clips. We will make our training and inference code public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederick Iat-Hin Tam, Tom Beucler, James H. Ruppert Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Cloud radiative feedback impacts early tropical cyclone (TC) intensification, but limitations in existing diagnostic frameworks make them unsuitable for studying asymmetric or transient radiative heating. We propose a linear Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) to learn the hidden relationship between radiation and the surface intensification of realistic simulated TCs. Limiting VED model inputs enables using its uncertainty to identify periods when radiation has more importance for intensification. A close examination of the extracted 3D radiative structures suggests that longwave radiative forcing from inner core deep convection and shallow clouds both contribute to intensification, with the deep convection having the most impact overall. We find that deep convection downwind of the shallow clouds is critical to the intensification of Haiyan. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can discover thermodynamic-kinematic relationships without relying on axisymmetric or deterministic assumptions, paving the way towards the objective discovery of processes leading to TC intensification in realistic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush</p>
<p>Abstract: Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the inductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in significantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive Transformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence length. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an appealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient decoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show MambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art subword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits of token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of efficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\times$ inference speedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding efficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs in enabling token-free language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Dooney, Lyana Curier, Daniel Tan, Melissa Lopez, Chris Van Den Broeck, Stefano Bromuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating realistic time-domain observations of gravitational waves (GWs) and GW detector glitches can help in advancing GW data analysis. Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Xianjun Yang, Mingyu Jin, Wei Cheng, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents shows great potential to revolutionize task planning, capturing significant attention. Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments. Data and code are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/TrustAgent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.</p>

<p>Abstract: People aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors in solving a variety of tasks with flexibility and ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and applying high-level knowledge acquired over time. But artificial agents are more like specialists, lacking such generalist behaviors. Artificial agents will require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge representations. We present a metacognitive generalization framework, Knowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects leveraging type space facilitate the learning of transferable interaction concepts and generalization. It is a natural way of integrating knowledge into reinforcement learning and is promising to act as an enabler for autonomous and generalist behaviors in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zou, Runpeng Geng, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate these limitations. The key idea of RAG is to ground the answer generation of an LLM on external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge database. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. We find that the knowledge database in a RAG system introduces a new and practical attack surface. Based on this attack surface, we propose PoisonedRAG, the first knowledge corruption attack to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few malicious texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of malicious texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on a RAG system, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results show PoisonedRAG could achieve a 90% attack success rate when injecting five malicious texts for each target question into a knowledge database with millions of texts. We also evaluate several defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against PoisonedRAG, highlighting the need for new defenses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Song, Qincheng Lu, He Zhu, David Buckeridge, Yue Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning time-series representations for discriminative tasks, such as classification and regression, has been a long-standing challenge in the healthcare domain. Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies are typically implemented with fixed control rates, often disregarding the impact of control rate selection. This can lead to inefficiencies as the optimal control rate varies with task requirements. We propose the Multi-Objective Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (MOSEAC), an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that uses elastic time steps to dynamically adjust the control frequency. This approach minimizes computational resources by selecting the lowest viable frequency. We show that MOSEAC converges and produces stable policies at the theoretical level, and validate our findings in a real-time 3D racing game. MOSEAC significantly outperformed other variable time step approaches in terms of energy efficiency and task effectiveness. Additionally, MOSEAC demonstrated faster and more stable training, showcasing its potential for real-world RL applications in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunwei Bai, Ying Kiat Tan, Shiming Chen, Yao Shu, Tsuhan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot-learning (FSL) commonly requires a model to identify images (queries) that belong to classes unseen during training, based on a few labeled samples of the new classes (support set) as reference. So far, plenty of algorithms involve training data augmentation to improve the generalization capability of FSL models, but outlier queries or support images during inference can still pose great generalization challenges. In this work, to reduce the bias caused by the outlier samples, we generate additional test-class samples by combining original samples with suitable train-class samples via a generative image combiner. Then, we obtain averaged features via an augmentor, which leads to more typical representations through the averaging. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., obtaining a test accuracy improvement proportion of around 10% (e.g., from 46.86% to 53.28%) for trained FSL models. Importantly, given pretrained image combiner, our method is training-free for off-the-shelf FSL models, whose performance can be improved without extra datasets nor further training of the models themselves.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research embarked on a comparative exploration of the holistic segmentation capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in both 2D and 3D formats, focusing on cystic fibrosis (CF) lesions. The study utilized data from two CF reference centers, covering five major CF structural changes. Initially, it compared the 2D and 3D models, highlighting the 3D model's superior capability in capturing complex features like mucus plugs and consolidations. To improve the 2D model's performance, a loss adapted to fine structures segmentation was implemented and evaluated, significantly enhancing its accuracy, though not surpassing the 3D model's performance. The models underwent further validation through external evaluation against pulmonary function tests (PFTs), confirming the robustness of the findings. Moreover, this study went beyond comparing metrics; it also included comprehensive assessments of the models' interpretability and reliability, providing valuable insights for their clinical application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaile Du, Yifan Zhou, Fan Lyu, Yuyang Li, Chen Lu, Guangcan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The partial label challenge in Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning (MLCIL) arises when only the new classes are labeled during training, while past and future labels remain unavailable. This issue leads to a proliferation of false-positive errors due to erroneously high confidence multi-label predictions, exacerbating catastrophic forgetting within the disjoint label space. In this paper, we aim to refine multi-label confidence calibration in MLCIL and propose a Confidence Self-Calibration (CSC) approach. Firstly, for label relationship calibration, we introduce a class-incremental graph convolutional network that bridges the isolated label spaces by constructing learnable, dynamically extended label relationship graph. Then, for confidence calibration, we present a max-entropy regularization for each multi-label increment, facilitating confidence self-calibration through the penalization of over-confident output distributions. Our approach attains new state-of-the-art results in MLCIL tasks on both MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, with the calibration of label confidences confirmed through our methodology.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency. Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.
  To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.
  We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Ruijie Quan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: A major public concern regarding the training of large language models (LLMs) is whether they abusing copyrighted online text. Previous membership inference methods may be misled by similar examples in vast amounts of training data. Additionally, these methods are often too complex for general users to understand and use, making them centralized, lacking transparency, and trustworthiness. To address these issues, we propose an alternative \textit{insert-and-detection} methodology, advocating that web users and content platforms employ \textbf{\textit{unique identifiers}} for reliable and independent membership inference. Users and platforms can create their own identifiers, embed them in copyrighted text, and independently detect them in future LLMs. As an initial demonstration, we introduce \textit{ghost sentences}, a primitive form of unique identifiers, consisting primarily of passphrases made up of random words. By embedding one ghost sentences in a few copyrighted texts, users can detect its membership using a perplexity test and a \textit{user-friendly} last-$k$ words test. The perplexity test is based on the fact that LLMs trained on natural language should exhibit high perplexity when encountering unnatural passphrases. As the repetition increases, users can leverage the verbatim memorization ability of LLMs to perform a last-$k$ words test by chatting with LLMs without writing any code. Both tests offer rigorous statistical guarantees for membership inference. For LLaMA-13B, a perplexity test on 30 ghost sentences with an average of 7 repetitions in 148K examples yields a 0.891 ROC AUC. For the last-$k$ words test with OpenLLaMA-3B, 11 out of 16 users, with an average of 24 examples each, successfully identify their data from 1.8M examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhong Liu, Han Zhou, Zhijiang Guo, Ehsan Shareghi, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen, Nigel Collier</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities as automatic evaluators in assessing the quality of generated natural language. However, LLMs still exhibit biases in evaluation and often struggle to generate coherent evaluations that align with human assessments. In this work, we first conduct a systematic study of the misalignment between LLM evaluators and human judgement, revealing that existing calibration methods aimed at mitigating biases are insufficient for effectively aligning LLM evaluators. Inspired by the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PairS), an uncertainty-guided search method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons and efficiently ranks candidate texts. PairS achieves state-of-the-art performance on representative evaluation tasks and demonstrates significant improvements over direct scoring. Furthermore, we provide insights into the role of pairwise preference in quantifying the transitivity of LLMs and demonstrate how PairS benefits from calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting-Kang Yen, Igor Morawski, Shusil Dangi, Kai He, Chung-Yi Lin, Jia-Fong Yeh, Hung-Ting Su, Winston Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based object detection has recently garnered attention in the computer vision community due to the exceptional properties of event cameras, such as high dynamic range and no motion blur. However, feature asynchronism and sparsity cause invisible objects due to no relative motion to the camera, posing a significant challenge in the task. Prior works have studied various implicit-learned memories to retain as many temporal cues as possible. However, implicit memories still struggle to preserve long-term features effectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as pseudo-occluded objects and aim to detect them by tracking through occlusions. Firstly, we introduce the visibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to not only clean the existing event camera dataset but also append additional visibility labels to it. Secondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to maintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features have not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated as an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the displacements of objects across frames. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal feature aggregation module to enrich the latent features and a consistency loss to increase the robustness of the overall pipeline. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method's effectiveness where still objects are retained, but real occluded objects are discarded. The results demonstrate that (1) the additional visibility labels can assist in supervised training, and (2) our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a significant improvement of 7.9% absolute mAP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyan Guo, Ayush Utkarsh, Wenbo Ding, Isabelle Ondracek, Ziming Zhao, Guo Freeman, Nishant Vishwamitra, Hongxin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online user generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqiang Wang, Edmund Y. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Phase recovery, calculating the phase of a light wave from its intensity measurements, is essential for various applications, such as coherent diffraction imaging, adaptive optics, and biomedical imaging. It enables the reconstruction of an object's refractive index distribution or topography as well as the correction of imaging system aberrations. In recent years, deep learning has been proven to be highly effective in addressing phase recovery problems. Two most direct deep learning phase recovery strategies are data-driven (DD) with supervised learning mode and physics-driven (PD) with self-supervised learning mode. DD and PD achieve the same goal in different ways and lack the necessary study to reveal similarities and differences. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively compare these two deep learning phase recovery strategies in terms of time consumption, accuracy, generalization ability, ill-posedness adaptability, and prior capacity. What's more, we propose a co-driven (CD) strategy of combining datasets and physics for the balance of high- and low-frequency information. The codes for DD, PD, and CD are publicly available at https://github.com/kqwang/DLPR.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work introduces an efficient method to scale Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to infinitely long inputs with bounded memory and computation. A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongrui Gui, Shuyang Sun, Runjia Li, Jianhao Yuan, Zhaochong An, Karsten Roth, Ameya Prabhu, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual segmentation has not yet tackled the challenge of improving open-vocabulary segmentation models with training data for accurate segmentation across large, continually expanding vocabularies. We discover that traditional continual training results in severe catastrophic forgetting, failing to outperform a zero-shot segmentation baseline. We introduce a novel training-free strategy, kNN-CLIP, which augments the model with a database of instance embeddings for semantic and panoptic segmentation that achieves zero forgetting. We demonstrate that kNN-CLIP can adapt to continually growing vocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. kNN-CLIP enables open-vocabulary segmentation methods to expand their vocabularies on any domain with a single pass through the data, while only storing compact embeddings. This approach minimizes both compute and memory costs. kNN-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across large-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation datasets. We hope kNN-CLIP represents a significant step forward in enabling more efficient and adaptable continual segmentation, paving the way for advances in real-world large-vocabulary continual segmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Yan, Zhiyao Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: The neural semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) framework has demonstrated promise for event-based piano transcription. In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed time intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. This paper introduces a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only structured non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in terms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakeeb Murtaza, Soufiane Belharbi, Marco Pedersoli, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) allows training deep learning models for classification and localization (LOC) using only global class-level labels. The absence of bounding box (bbox) supervision during training raises challenges in the literature for hyper-parameter tuning, model selection, and evaluation. WSOL methods rely on a validation set with bbox annotations for model selection, and a test set with bbox annotations for threshold estimation for producing bboxes from localization maps. This approach, however, is not aligned with the WSOL setting as these annotations are typically unavailable in real-world scenarios. Our initial empirical analysis shows a significant decline in LOC performance when model selection and threshold estimation rely solely on class labels and the image itself, respectively, compared to using manual bbox annotations. This highlights the importance of incorporating bbox labels for optimal model performance. In this paper, a new WSOL evaluation protocol is proposed that provides LOC information without the need for manual bbox annotations. In particular, we generated noisy pseudo-boxes from a pretrained off-the-shelf region proposal method such as Selective Search, CLIP, and RPN for model selection. These bboxes are also employed to estimate the threshold from LOC maps, circumventing the need for test-set bbox annotations. Our experiments with several WSOL methods on ILSVRC and CUB datasets show that using the proposed pseudo-bboxes for validation facilitates the model selection and threshold estimation, with LOC performance comparable to those selected using GT bboxes on the validation set and threshold estimation on the test set. It also outperforms models selected using class-level labels, and then dynamically thresholded based solely on LOC maps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lun Ai, Stephen H. Muggleton, Shi-Shun Liang, Geoff S. Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: Techniques to autonomously drive research have been prominent in Computational Scientific Discovery, while Synthetic Biology is a field of science that focuses on designing and constructing new biological systems for useful purposes. Here we seek to apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery. Comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) are often used to evaluate cellular engineering strategies to optimise target compound production. However, predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs, often due to errors in the models. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> D. Aristoff, M. Johnson, G. Simpson, R. J. Webber</p>
<p>Abstract: In the study of stochastic systems, the committor function describes the probability that a system starting from an initial configuration $x$ will reach a set $B$ before a set $A$. This paper introduces an efficient and interpretable algorithm for approximating the committor, called the "fast committor machine" (FCM). The FCM uses simulated trajectory data to build a kernel-based model of the committor. The kernel function is constructed to emphasize low-dimensional subspaces that optimally describe the $A$ to $B$ transitions. The coefficients in the kernel model are determined using randomized linear algebra, leading to a runtime that scales linearly in the number of data points. In numerical experiments involving a triple-well potential and alanine dipeptide, the FCM yields higher accuracy and trains more quickly than a neural network with the same number of parameters. The FCM is also more interpretable than the neural net.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Augmented Physics, a machine learning-integrated authoring tool designed for creating embedded interactive physics simulations from static textbook diagrams. Leveraging recent advancements in computer vision, such as Segment Anything and Multi-modal LLMs, our web-based system enables users to semi-automatically extract diagrams from physics textbooks and generate interactive simulations based on the extracted content.

Drawing from an elicitation study with seven physics instructors, we explore four key augmentation strategies: 1) augmented experiments, 2) animated diagrams, 3) bi-directional binding, and 4) parameter visualization. We evaluate our system through technical evaluation, a usability study (N=12), and expert interviews (N=12). Study findings suggest that our system can facilitate more engaging and personalized learning experiences in physics education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjia Kang, Songhua Zhou, Shuyan Fang, Shichao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular properties is crucial in drug discovery. Traditional methods often overlook that real-world molecules typically exhibit multiple property labels with complex correlations. To this end, we propose a novel framework, HiPM, which stands for hierarchical prompted molecular representation learning framework. HiPM leverages task-aware prompts to enhance the differential expression of tasks in molecular representations and mitigate negative transfer caused by conflicts in individual task information. Our framework comprises two core components: the Molecular Representation Encoder (MRE) and the Task-Aware Prompter (TAP). MRE employs a hierarchical message-passing network architecture to capture molecular features at both the atom and motif levels. Meanwhile, TAP utilizes agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to construct a prompt tree that reflects task affinity and distinctiveness, enabling the model to consider multi-granular correlation information among tasks, thereby effectively handling the complexity of multi-label property prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiPM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multi-label datasets, offering a novel perspective on multi-label molecular representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai-Long Sun, Da-Wei Zhou, Yang Li, Shiyin Lu, Chao Yi, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence. Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves. We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages. This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level. Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens. Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts. The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens. Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB. Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks. Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available. Code is available at: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Parrot.</p>

<p>Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) severity is determined by the presence and ratios of blast cells (abnormal white blood cells) in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. Manual diagnosis of this disease is a tedious and time-consuming operation, making it difficult for professionals to accurately examine blast cell characteristics. To address this difficulty, researchers use deep learning and machine learning. In this paper, a ResNet-based feature extractor is utilized to detect ALL, along with a variety of feature selectors and classifiers. To get the best results, a variety of transfer learning models, including the Resnet, VGG, EfficientNet, and DensNet families, are used as deep feature extractors. Following extraction, different feature selectors are used, including Genetic algorithm, PCA, ANOVA, Random Forest, Univariate, Mutual information, Lasso, XGB, Variance, and Binary ant colony. After feature qualification, a variety of classifiers are used, with MLP outperforming the others. The recommended technique is used to categorize ALL and HEM in the selected dataset which is C-NMC 2019. This technique got an impressive 90.71% accuracy and 95.76% sensitivity for the relevant classifications, and its metrics on this dataset outperformed others.</p>

Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework addressing data fragmentation and siloing challenges, enabling scalable AI through data sovereignty. It facilitates effective AI utilization within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Helios, the first extremely low-power, real-time, event-based hand gesture recognition system designed for all-day on smart eyewear. As augmented reality (AR) evolves, current smart glasses like the Meta Ray-Bans prioritize visual and wearable comfort at the expense of functionality. Existing human-machine interfaces (HMIs) in these devices, such as capacitive touch and voice controls, present limitations in ergonomics, privacy and power consumption. Helios addresses these challenges by leveraging natural hand interactions for a more intuitive and comfortable user experience. Our system utilizes a extremely low-power and compact 3mmx4mm/20mW event camera to perform natural hand-based gesture recognition for always-on smart eyewear. The camera's output is processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) running on a NXP Nano UltraLite compute platform, consuming less than 350mW. Helios can recognize seven classes of gestures, including subtle microgestures like swipes and pinches, with 91% accuracy. We also demonstrate real-time performance across 20 users at a remarkably low latency of 60ms. Our user testing results align with the positive feedback we received during our recent successful demo at AWE-USA-2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjie He, Daniel Hernandez, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yuqicheng Zhu, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukrut Rao, Sweta Mahajan, Moritz B\"ohle, Bernt Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have recently been proposed to address the 'black-box' problem of deep neural networks, by first mapping images to a human-understandable concept space and then linearly combining concepts for classification. Such models typically require first coming up with a set of concepts relevant to the task and then aligning the representations of a feature extractor to map to these concepts. However, even with powerful foundational feature extractors like CLIP, there are no guarantees that the specified concepts are detectable. In this work, we leverage recent advances in mechanistic interpretability and propose a novel CBM approach -- called Discover-then-Name-CBM (DN-CBM) -- that inverts the typical paradigm: instead of pre-selecting concepts based on the downstream classification task, we use sparse autoencoders to first discover concepts learnt by the model, and then name them and train linear probes for classification. Our concept extraction strategy is efficient, since it is agnostic to the downstream task, and uses concepts already known to the model. We perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and CLIP architectures and show that our method yields semantically meaningful concepts, assigns appropriate names to them that make them easy to interpret, and yields performant and interpretable CBMs. Code available at https://github.com/neuroexplicit-saar/discover-then-name.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Abraham, Andr\'es Hoyos Idrobo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing access to administrative health databases, retrospective studies have become crucial evidence for medical treatments. Yet, non-randomized studies frequently face selection biases, requiring mitigation strategies. Propensity score matching (PSM) addresses these biases by selecting comparable populations, allowing for analysis without further methodological constraints. However, PSM has several drawbacks. Different matching methods can produce significantly different Average Treatment Effects (ATE) for the same task, even when meeting all validation criteria. To prevent cherry-picking the best method, public authorities must involve field experts and engage in extensive discussions with researchers.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel metric, A2A, to reduce the number of valid matches. A2A constructs artificial matching tasks that mirror the original ones but with known outcomes, assessing each matching method's performance comprehensively from propensity estimation to ATE estimation. When combined with Standardized Mean Difference, A2A enhances the precision of model selection, resulting in a reduction of up to 50% in ATE estimation errors across synthetic tasks and up to 90% in predicted ATE variability across both synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, A2A is the first metric capable of evaluating outcome correction accuracy using covariates not involved in selection.
  Computing A2A requires solving hundreds of PSMs, we therefore automate all manual steps of the PSM pipeline. We integrate PSM methods from Python and R, our automated pipeline, a new metric, and reproducible experiments into popmatch, our new Python package, to enhance reproducibility and accessibility to bias correction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyan Xu, Zhenmei Shi, Yingyu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open and largely underexplored question. In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks including linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides no improvements. We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atul Kumar, Siddharth Garg, Soumya Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently resulted in their application to challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, understanding factors like prediction quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights aid application scientists in making informed decisions. However, DNNs lack inherent mechanisms to measure prediction uncertainty, prompting the creation of distinct frameworks for constructing robust uncertainty-aware models tailored to various visualization tasks. In this work, we develop uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model steady-state vector fields effectively. We comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, aimed at enabling uncertainty-informed visual analysis of features within steady vector field data. Our detailed exploration using several vector data sets indicate that uncertainty-aware models generate informative visualization results of vector field features. Furthermore, incorporating prediction uncertainty improves the resilience and interpretability of our DNN model, rendering it applicable for the analysis of non-trivial vector field data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago Monteiro</p>
<p>Abstract: In quantitative finance, machine learning methods are essential for alpha generation. This study introduces a new approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. During the COVID period (2019-2022), this dual-model approach achieved a 83% return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.77. It incorporates two risk models to enhance risk management, showing efficiency during volatile periods. The methodology was implemented on the QuantConnect platform, which was chosen for its robust framework and experimental reproducibility. The system, which predicts future price movements, includes a three-year warm-up to ensure proper algorithm function. It targets highly liquid, large-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also considering broker payments. The dual-model alpha system utilizes log returns to select the optimal state based on the historical performance. It combines state predictions with neural network outputs, which are based on historical data, to generate trading signals. This study examined the architecture of the trading system, data pre-processing, training, and performance. The full code and backtesting data are available under the QuantConnect terms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zheng, Zihan Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper establishes a new and comprehensive theoretical analysis for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in high-frequency market making. We bridge the modern RL theory and the continuous-time statistical models in high-frequency financial economics. Different with most existing literature on methodological research about developing various RL methods for market making problem, our work is a pilot to provide the theoretical analysis. We target the effects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between error and complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment $\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but the complexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under the general-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium to the continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$. The Nash Q-learning algorithm, which is an online multi-agent RL method, is applied to solve the equilibrium. Our theories are not only useful for practitioners to choose the sampling frequency, but also very general and applicable to other high-frequency financial decision making problems, e.g., optimal executions, as long as the time-discretization of a continuous-time markov decision process is adopted. Monte Carlo simulation evidence support all of our theories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liang, Linzhuang Sun, Jingxuan Wei, Xijie Huang, Linkun Sun, Bihui Yu, Conghui He, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), achieving excellent empathetic response capabilities has become a crucial prerequisite. Consequently, managing and understanding empathetic datasets have gained increasing significance. However, empathetic data are typically human-labeled, leading to insufficient datasets and wasted human labor. In this work, we present Synth-Empathy, an LLM-based data generation and quality and diversity selection pipeline that automatically generates high-quality empathetic data while discarding low-quality data. With the data generated from a low empathetic model, we are able to further improve empathetic response performance and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, our model achieves SoTA performance on various human evaluation benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications. Furthermore, we show the trade-off between data quantity and quality, providing insights into empathetic data generation and selection.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21770">MoMa: Efficient Early-Fusion Pre-training with Mixture of Modality-Aware Experts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Victoria Lin, Akshat Shrivastava, Liang Luo, Srinivasan Iyer, Mike Lewis, Gargi Ghosh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Armen Aghajanyan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MoMa, a novel modality-aware mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for pre-training mixed-modal, early-fusion language models. MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa's potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Schoch, Fan Yang, Yuntao Ma, Stefan Leutenegger, Marco Hutter, Quentin Leboutet</p>
<p>Abstract: Current visual navigation systems often treat the environment as static, lacking the ability to adaptively interact with obstacles. This limitation leads to navigation failure when encountering unavoidable obstructions. In response, we introduce IN-Sight, a novel approach to self-supervised path planning, enabling more effective navigation strategies through interaction with obstacles. Utilizing RGB-D observations, IN-Sight calculates traversability scores and incorporates them into a semantic map, facilitating long-range path planning in complex, maze-like environments. To precisely navigate around obstacles, IN-Sight employs a local planner, trained imperatively on a differentiable costmap using representation learning techniques. The entire framework undergoes end-to-end training within the state-of-the-art photorealistic Intel SPEAR Simulator. We validate the effectiveness of IN-Sight through extensive benchmarking in a variety of simulated scenarios and ablation studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the system's real-world applicability with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, deploying our planner on the legged robot platform ANYmal, showcasing its practical potential for interactive navigation in real environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Changepoint detection, a technique for identifying significant shifts within data sequences, is crucial in various fields such as finance, genomics, medicine, etc. Dynamic programming changepoint detection algorithms are employed to identify the locations of changepoints within a sequence, which rely on a penalty parameter to regulate the number of changepoints. To estimate this penalty parameter, previous work uses simple models such as linear models or decision trees. This study introduces a novel deep learning method for predicting penalty parameters, leading to demonstrably improved changepoint detection accuracy on large benchmark supervised labeled datasets compared to previous methods.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04065">Do Sharpness-based Optimizers Improve Generalization in Medical Image Analysis?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Hassan, Aleksandar Vakanski, Min Xian</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective clinical deployment of deep learning models in healthcare demands high generalization performance to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. In recent years, significant research has focused on improving the generalization of deep learning models by regularizing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Among the optimization approaches that explicitly minimize sharpness, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown potential in enhancing generalization performance on general domain image datasets. This success has led to the development of several advanced sharpness-based algorithms aimed at addressing the limitations of SAM, such as Adaptive SAM, surrogate-Gap SAM, Weighted SAM, and Curvature Regularized SAM. These sharpness-based optimizers have shown improvements in model generalization compared to conventional stochastic gradient descent optimizers and their variants on general domain image datasets, but they have not been thoroughly evaluated on medical images. This work provides a review of recent sharpness-based methods for improving the generalization of deep learning networks and evaluates the methods performance on medical breast ultrasound images. Our findings indicate that the initial SAM method successfully enhances the generalization of various deep learning models. While Adaptive SAM improves generalization of convolutional neural networks, it fails to do so for vision transformers. Other sharpness-based optimizers, however, do not demonstrate consistent results. The results reveal that, contrary to findings in the non-medical domain, SAM is the only recommended sharpness-based optimizer that consistently improves generalization in medical image analysis, and further research is necessary to refine the variants of SAM to enhance generalization performance in this field</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Atanasov, Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explaining decisions of black-box classifiers is both important and computationally challenging. In this paper, we scrutinize explainers that generate feature-based explanations from samples or datasets. We start by presenting a set of desirable properties that explainers would ideally satisfy, delve into their relationships, and highlight incompatibilities of some of them. We identify the entire family of explainers that satisfy two key properties which are compatible with all the others. Its instances provide sufficient reasons, called weak abductive explanations.We then unravel its various subfamilies that satisfy subsets of compatible properties. Indeed, we fully characterize all the explainers that satisfy any subset of compatible properties. In particular, we introduce the first (broad family of) explainers that guarantee the existence of explanations and their global consistency.We discuss some of its instances including the irrefutable explainer and the surrogate explainer whose explanations can be found in polynomial time.</p>
