<p><b>Authors:</b> Yana Wei, Liang Zhao, Kangheng Lin, En Yu, Yuang Peng, Runpei Dong, Jianjian Sun, Haoran Wei, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a perception in reflection paradigm designed to transcend the limitations of current large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are expected yet often fail to achieve perfect perception initially. Specifically, we propose Reflective Perception (RePer), a dual-model reflection mechanism that systematically alternates between policy and critic models, enables iterative refinement of visual perception. This framework is powered by Reflective Perceptual Learning (RPL), which reinforces intrinsic reflective capabilities through a methodically constructed visual reflection dataset and reflective unlikelihood training. Comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates RePer's quantifiable improvements in image understanding, captioning precision, and hallucination reduction. Notably, RePer achieves strong alignment between model attention patterns and human visual focus, while RPL optimizes fine-grained and free-form preference alignment. These advancements establish perception in reflection as a robust paradigm for future multimodal agents, particularly in tasks requiring complex reasoning and multi-step manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Chaubey, Xulang Guan, Mohammad Soleymani</p>
<p>Abstract: The human face plays a central role in social communication, necessitating the use of performant computer vision tools for human-centered applications. We propose Face-LLaVA, a multimodal large language model for face-centered, in-context learning, including facial expression and attribute recognition. Additionally, Face-LLaVA is able to generate natural language descriptions that can be used for reasoning. Leveraging existing visual databases, we first developed FaceInstruct-1M, a face-centered database for instruction tuning MLLMs for face processing. We then developed a novel face-specific visual encoder powered by Face-Region Guided Cross-Attention that integrates face geometry with local visual features. We evaluated the proposed method across nine different datasets and five different face processing tasks, including facial expression recognition, action unit detection, facial attribute detection, age estimation and deepfake detection. Face-LLaVA achieves superior results compared to existing open-source MLLMs and competitive performance compared to commercial solutions. Our model output also receives a higher reasoning rating by GPT under a zero-shot setting across all the tasks. Both our dataset and model wil be released at https://face-llava.github.io to support future advancements in social AI and foundational vision-language research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajhans Singh, Rafael Bidese Puhl, Kshitiz Dhakal, Sudhir Sornapudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are transforming agricultural applications by enabling automated phenotyping, monitoring, and yield estimation. However, their effectiveness heavily depends on large amounts of annotated training data, which can be labor and time intensive. Recent advances in open-set object detection, particularly with models like Grounding-DINO, offer a potential solution to detect regions of interests based on text prompt input. Initial zero-shot experiments revealed challenges in crafting effective text prompts, especially for complex objects like individual leaves and visually similar classes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient few-shot adaptation method that simplifies the Grounding-DINO architecture by removing the text encoder module (BERT) and introducing a randomly initialized trainable text embedding. This method achieves superior performance across multiple agricultural datasets, including plant-weed detection, plant counting, insect identification, fruit counting, and remote sensing tasks. Specifically, it demonstrates up to a $\sim24\%$ higher mAP than fully fine-tuned YOLO models on agricultural datasets and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by $\sim10\%$ in remote sensing, under few-shot learning conditions. Our method offers a promising solution for automating annotation and accelerating the development of specialized agricultural AI solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fereidoon Zangeneh, Amit Dekel, Alessandro Pieropan, Patric Jensfelt</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual relocalization is the task of estimating the camera pose given an image it views. Absolute pose regression offers a solution to this task by training a neural network, directly regressing the camera pose from image features. While an attractive solution in terms of memory and compute efficiency, absolute pose regression's predictions are inaccurate and unreliable outside the training domain. In this work, we propose a novel method for quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of an absolute pose regression model by estimating the likelihood of observations within a variational framework. Beyond providing a measure of confidence in predictions, our approach offers a unified model that also handles observation ambiguities, probabilistically localizing the camera in the presence of repetitive structures. Our method outperforms existing approaches in capturing the relation between uncertainty and prediction error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krzysztof Byrski, Jacek Tabor, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek, Marcin Mazur</p>
<p>Abstract: In practical applications of regression analysis, it is not uncommon to encounter a multitude of values for each attribute. In such a situation, the univariate distribution, which is typically Gaussian, is suboptimal because the mean may be situated between modes, resulting in a predicted value that differs significantly from the actual data. Consequently, to address this issue, a mixture distribution with parameters learned by a neural network, known as a Mixture Density Network (MDN), is typically employed. However, this approach has an important inherent limitation, in that it is not feasible to ascertain the precise number of components with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In this paper, we introduce CEC-MMR, a novel approach based on Cross-Entropy Clustering (CEC), which allows for the automatic detection of the number of components in a regression problem. Furthermore, given an attribute and its value, our method is capable of uniquely identifying it with the underlying component. The experimental results demonstrate that CEC-MMR yields superior outcomes compared to classical MDNs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07334">Objaverse++: Curated 3D Object Dataset with Quality Annotations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendi Lin, Heshan Liu, Qunshu Lin, Zachary Bright, Shitao Tang, Yihui He, Minghao Liu, Ling Zhu, Cindy Le</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Objaverse++, a curated subset of Objaverse enhanced with detailed attribute annotations by human experts. Recent advances in 3D content generation have been driven by large-scale datasets such as Objaverse, which contains over 800,000 3D objects collected from the Internet. Although Objaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is limited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation, we manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including aesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object composition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural network capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset. Through experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that models pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance than those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation tasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by our tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the training loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich annotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more efficient path to develop 3D generative models. We release our enhanced dataset of approximately 500,000 curated 3D models to facilitate further research on various downstream tasks in 3D computer vision. In the near future, we aim to extend our annotations to cover the entire Objaverse dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Jadhav, Michael Greenspan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DLTPose, a novel method for 6DoF object pose estimation from RGB-D images that combines the accuracy of sparse keypoint methods with the robustness of dense pixel-wise predictions. DLTPose predicts per-pixel radial distances to a set of minimally four keypoints, which are then fed into our novel Direct Linear Transform (DLT) formulation to produce accurate 3D object frame surface estimates, leading to better 6DoF pose estimation. Additionally, we introduce a novel symmetry-aware keypoint ordering approach, designed to handle object symmetries that otherwise cause inconsistencies in keypoint assignments. Previous keypoint-based methods relied on fixed keypoint orderings, which failed to account for the multiple valid configurations exhibited by symmetric objects, which our ordering approach exploits to enhance the model's ability to learn stable keypoint representations. Extensive experiments on the benchmark LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets show that DLTPose outperforms existing methods, especially for symmetric and occluded objects, demonstrating superior Mean Average Recall values of 86.5% (LM), 79.7% (LM-O) and 89.5% (YCB-V).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Dai, Kai Ye, Guodong Liu, Haoteng Tang, Liang Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation has achieved remarkable success through the continuous advancement of UNet-based and Transformer-based foundation backbones. However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Han, Corentin Dumery</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become increasingly popular in 3D scene reconstruction for its high visual accuracy. However, uncertainty estimation of 3DGS scenes remains underexplored and is crucial to downstream tasks such as asset extraction and scene completion. Since the appearance of 3D gaussians is view-dependent, the color of a gaussian can thus be certain from an angle and uncertain from another. We thus propose to model uncertainty in 3DGS as an additional view-dependent per-gaussian feature that can be modeled with spherical harmonics. This simple yet effective modeling is easily interpretable and can be integrated into the traditional 3DGS pipeline. It is also significantly faster than ensemble methods while maintaining high accuracy, as demonstrated in our experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07375">Novel Diffusion Models for Multimodal 3D Hand Trajectory Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Ma, Wentao Bao, Jingyi Xu, Guanzhong Sun, Xieyuanli Chen, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting hand motion is critical for understanding human intentions and bridging the action space between human movements and robot manipulations. Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/MMTwin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongkang Dai, Xiaoshui Huang, Yunpeng Bai, Hao Guo, Hongping Gan, Ling Yang, Yilei Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing geometric features on B-rep models is a cornerstone technique for multimedia content-based retrieval and has been widely applied in intelligent manufacturing. However, previous research often merely focused on Machining Feature Recognition (MFR), falling short in effectively capturing the intricate topological and geometric characteristics of complex geometry features. In this paper, we propose BRepFormer, a novel transformer-based model to recognize both machining feature and complex CAD models' features. BRepFormer encodes and fuses the geometric and topological features of the models. Afterwards, BRepFormer utilizes a transformer architecture for feature propagation and a recognition head to identify geometry features. During each iteration of the transformer, we incorporate a bias that combines edge features and topology features to reinforce geometric constraints on each face. In addition, we also proposed a dataset named Complex B-rep Feature Dataset (CBF), comprising 20,000 B-rep models. By covering more complex B-rep models, it is better aligned with industrial applications. The experimental results demonstrate that BRepFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and our CBF datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingchao Jiang, Zhishuo Xu, Zhiying Zhu, Ning Chen, Haoyue Wang, Zhongjie Ba</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in image generation enable hyper-realistic synthetic faces but also pose risks, thus making synthetic face detection crucial. Previous research focuses on the general differences between generated images and real images, often overlooking the discrepancies among various generative techniques. In this paper, we explore the intrinsic relationship between synthetic images and their corresponding generation technologies. We find that specific images exhibit significant reconstruction discrepancies across different generative methods and that matching generation techniques provide more accurate reconstructions. Based on this insight, we propose a Multi-Reconstruction-based detector. By reversing and reconstructing images using multiple generative models, we analyze the reconstruction differences among real, GAN-generated, and DM-generated images to facilitate effective differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the Asian Synthetic Face Dataset (ASFD), containing synthetic Asian faces generated with various GANs and DMs. This dataset complements existing synthetic face datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our detector achieves exceptional performance, with strong generalization and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darian Toma\v{s}evi\'c, Fadi Boutros, Chenhao Lin, Naser Damer, Vitomir \v{S}truc, Peter Peer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner. The source code for the ID-Booth framework is publicly available at https://github.com/dariant/ID-Booth.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce FAIR-SIGHT, an innovative post-hoc framework designed to ensure fairness in computer vision systems by combining conformal prediction with a dynamic output repair mechanism. Our approach calculates a fairness-aware non-conformity score that simultaneously assesses prediction errors and fairness violations. Using conformal prediction, we establish an adaptive threshold that provides rigorous finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. When the non-conformity score for a new image exceeds the calibrated threshold, FAIR-SIGHT implements targeted corrective adjustments, such as logit shifts for classification and confidence recalibration for detection, to reduce both group and individual fairness disparities, all without the need for retraining or having access to internal model parameters. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates our method's error control and convergence properties. At the same time, extensive empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that FAIR-SIGHT significantly reduces fairness disparities while preserving high predictive performance.</p>

Existing methods typically face inherent trade-offs between identity preservation and personalized manipulation. We introduce FlexIP, a novel framework that decouples these objectives through two dedicated components: a Personalization Adapter for stylistic manipulation and a Preservation Adapter for identity maintenance. By explicitly injecting both control mechanisms into the generative model, our framework enables flexible parameterized control during inference through dynamic tuning of the weight adapter. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach breaks through the performance limitations of conventional methods, achieving superior identity preservation while supporting more diverse personalized generation capabilities (Project Page: https://flexip-tech.github.io/flexip/).</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) holds potential to reduce radiologists' workload, especially as recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable the development of multimodal models for chest X-ray (CXR) report generation. However, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are resource-intensive, requiring vast datasets and substantial computational cost for training. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation approach that leverages multimodal retrieval and LLMs to generate radiology reports while mitigating hallucinations and reducing computational demands. Our method uses LLMs to extract key phrases from radiology reports, effectively focusing on essential diagnostic information. Through exploring effective training strategies, including image encoder structure search, adding noise to text embeddings, and additional training objectives, we combine complementary pre-trained image encoders and adopt contrastive learning between text and semantic image embeddings. We evaluate our approach on MIMIC-CXR dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results on CheXbert metrics and competitive RadGraph F1 metric alongside MLLMs, without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our method demonstrates robust generalization for multi-view RRG, making it suitable for comprehensive clinical applications.</p>

RadZero leverages large language models to extract minimal semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs a multi-positive contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It also utilizes a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, RadZero enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification and pixel-level cross-modal similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, cross-modal similarity map analysis highlights its potential for improving explainability in vision-language alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anning Hu, Ang Li, Xirui Jin, Danping Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ThermoStereoRT, a real-time thermal stereo matching method designed for all-weather conditions that recovers disparity from two rectified thermal stereo images, envisioning applications such as night-time drone surveillance or under-bed cleaning robots. Leveraging a lightweight yet powerful backbone, ThermoStereoRT constructs a 3D cost volume from thermal images and employs multi-scale attention mechanisms to produce an initial disparity map. To refine this map, we design a novel channel and spatial attention module. Addressing the challenge of sparse ground truth data in thermal imagery, we utilize knowledge distillation to boost performance without increasing computational demands. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that ThermoStereoRT delivers both real-time capacity and robust accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world deployment in various challenging environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huilin Yin, Pengyu Wang, Senmao Li, Jun Yan, Daniel Watzenig</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust object detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in complex water environments is essential for reliable navigation and operation. Specifically, water surface object detection faces challenges from blurred edges and diverse object scales. Although vision-radar fusion offers a feasible solution, existing approaches suffer from cross-modal feature conflicts, which negatively affect model robustness. To address this problem, we propose a robust vision-radar fusion model WS-DETR. In particular, we first introduce a Multi-Scale Edge Information Integration (MSEII) module to enhance edge perception and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregator (HiFA) to boost multi-scale object detection in the encoder. Then, we adopt self-moving point representations for continuous convolution and residual connection to efficiently extract irregular features under the scenarios of irregular point cloud data. To further mitigate cross-modal conflicts, an Adaptive Feature Interactive Fusion (AFIF) module is introduced to integrate visual and radar features through geometric alignment and semantic fusion. Extensive experiments on the WaterScenes dataset demonstrate that WS-DETR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, maintaining its superiority even under adverse weather and lighting conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitian Tang, Shijie Wang, Junho Cho, Jaewook Yoo, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: How multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perceive the visual world remains a mystery. To one extreme, object and relation modeling may be implicitly implemented with inductive biases, for example by treating objects as tokens. To the other extreme, empirical results reveal the surprising finding that simply performing visual captioning, which tends to ignore spatial configuration of the objects, serves as a strong baseline for video understanding. We aim to answer the question: how can objects help video-language understanding in MLLMs? We tackle the question from the object representation and adaptation perspectives. Specifically, we investigate the trade-off between representation expressiveness (e.g., distributed versus symbolic) and integration difficulty (e.g., data-efficiency when learning the adapters). Through extensive evaluations on five video question answering datasets, we confirm that explicit integration of object-centric representation remains necessary, and the symbolic objects can be most easily integrated while being performant for question answering. We hope our findings can encourage the community to explore the explicit integration of perception modules into MLLM design. Our code and models will be publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengrun Zhao, Yunzhi Zhuge, Yifan Wang, Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu, Yu Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, advanced image editing and generation methods have rapidly evolved, making detecting and locating forged image content increasingly challenging. Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying the edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different forgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included in the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we present an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL). Once trained, our model can detect both seen and unseen forgeries, providing a more practical and efficient solution to counter false information in the era of generative AI. Our method focuses on learning general features from the pristine content rather than traces of specific forgeries, which are relatively consistent across different types of forgeries and therefore can be used as universal features to locate unseen forgeries. Additionally, as existing image forgery datasets are still dominated by traditional hand-crafted forgeries, we construct a new dataset consisting of images edited by various popular deep generative image editing methods to further encourage research in detecting images manipulated by deep generative models. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the detection of unseen forgeries and also demonstrates competitive results for seen forgeries.

<p>Abstract: Digital images of Chinas maps play a crucial role in map detection, particularly in ensuring national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and map compliance. However, there is currently no publicly available dataset specifically dedicated to problematic maps the CME dataset. Existing datasets primarily focus on general map data and are insufficient for effectively identifying complex issues such as national boundary misrepresentations, missing elements, and blurred boundaries. Therefore, this study creates a Problematic Map dataset that covers five key problem areas, aiming to provide diverse samples for problematic map detection technologies, support high-precision map compliance detection, and enhance map data quality and timeliness. This dataset not only provides essential resources for map compliance, national security monitoring, and map updates, but also fosters innovation and application of related technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8 on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal thinking models.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07503">Event Signal Filtering via Probability Flux Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinze Chen, Wei Zhai, Yang Cao, Bin Li, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Events offer a novel paradigm for capturing scene dynamics via asynchronous sensing, but their inherent randomness often leads to degraded signal quality. Event signal filtering is thus essential for enhancing fidelity by reducing this internal randomness and ensuring consistent outputs across diverse acquisition conditions. Unlike traditional time series that rely on fixed temporal sampling to capture steady-state behaviors, events encode transient dynamics through polarity and event intervals, making signal modeling significantly more complex. To address this, the theoretical foundation of event generation is revisited through the lens of diffusion processes. The state and process information within events is modeled as continuous probability flux at threshold boundaries of the underlying irradiance diffusion. Building on this insight, a generative, online filtering framework called Event Density Flow Filter (EDFilter) is introduced. EDFilter estimates event correlation by reconstructing the continuous probability flux from discrete events using nonparametric kernel smoothing, and then resamples filtered events from this flux. To optimize fidelity over time, spatial and temporal kernels are employed in a time-varying optimization framework. A fast recursive solver with O(1) complexity is proposed, leveraging state-space models and lookup tables for efficient likelihood computation. Furthermore, a new real-world benchmark Rotary Event Dataset (RED) is released, offering microsecond-level ground truth irradiance for full-reference event filtering evaluation. Extensive experiments validate EDFilter's performance across tasks like event filtering, super-resolution, and direct event-based blob tracking. Significant gains in downstream applications such as SLAM and video reconstruction underscore its robustness and effectiveness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07519">VideoExpert: Augmented LLM for Temporal-Sensitive Video Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Henghao Zhao, Ge-Peng Ji, Rui Yan, Huan Xiong, Zechao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The core challenge in video understanding lies in perceiving dynamic content changes over time. However, multimodal large language models struggle with temporal-sensitive video tasks, which requires generating timestamps to mark the occurrence of specific events. Existing strategies require MLLMs to generate absolute or relative timestamps directly. We have observed that those MLLMs tend to rely more on language patterns than visual cues when generating timestamps, affecting their performance. To address this problem, we propose VideoExpert, a general-purpose MLLM suitable for several temporal-sensitive video tasks. Inspired by the expert concept, VideoExpert integrates two parallel modules: the Temporal Expert and the Spatial Expert. The Temporal Expert is responsible for modeling time sequences and performing temporal grounding. It processes high-frame-rate yet compressed tokens to capture dynamic variations in videos and includes a lightweight prediction head for precise event localization. The Spatial Expert focuses on content detail analysis and instruction following. It handles specially designed spatial tokens and language input, aiming to generate content-related responses. These two experts collaborate seamlessly via a special token, ensuring coordinated temporal grounding and content generation. Notably, the Temporal and Spatial Experts maintain independent parameter sets. By offloading temporal grounding from content generation, VideoExpert prevents text pattern biases in timestamp predictions. Moreover, we introduce a Spatial Compress module to obtain spatial tokens. This module filters and compresses patch tokens while preserving key information, delivering compact yet detail-rich input for the Spatial Expert. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the VideoExpert.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhao, Pengju Zhang, Bo Liu, Yihong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D occupancy prediction, aiming to predict the occupancy and semantics within interesting regions of 3D scenes from only 2D images, has garnered increasing attention recently for its vital role in 3D scene understanding. Predicting the 3D occupancy of large-scale outdoor scenes from 2D images is ill-posed and resource-intensive. In this paper, we present \textbf{DGOcc}, a \textbf{D}epth-aware \textbf{G}lobal query-based network for monocular 3D \textbf{Occ}upancy prediction. We first explore prior depth maps to extract depth context features that provide explicit geometric information for the occupancy network. Then, in order to fully exploit the depth context features, we propose a Global Query-based (GQ) Module. The cooperation of attention mechanisms and scale-aware operations facilitates the feature interaction between images and 3D voxels. Moreover, a Hierarchical Supervision Strategy (HSS) is designed to avoid upsampling the high-dimension 3D voxel features to full resolution, which mitigates GPU memory utilization and time cost. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best performance on monocular semantic occupancy prediction while reducing GPU and time overhead.</p>

The integration of machine learning (ML) into AV perception systems highlights the need for locally labelled datasets to develop and test algorithms in specific environments.

This dataset, collected from Sydney and surrounding cities in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, consists of 756 images with high-quality pixel-level annotations. It is designed to assist AV industry and researchers by providing annotated data and tools for algorithm development, testing, and deployment in the Australian context.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingliang Zhang, Zihui Wu, Berthy T. Feng, Yang Song, Yisong Yue, Katherine L. Bouman</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how to solve general Bayesian inverse problems involving videos using diffusion model priors. While it is desirable to use a video diffusion prior to effectively capture complex temporal relationships, due to the computational and data requirements of training such a model, prior work has instead relied on image diffusion priors on single frames combined with heuristics to enforce temporal consistency. However, these approaches struggle with faithfully recovering the underlying temporal relationships, particularly for tasks with high temporal uncertainty. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of practical and accessible spatiotemporal diffusion priors by fine-tuning latent video diffusion models from pretrained image diffusion models using limited videos in specific domains. Leveraging this plug-and-play spatiotemporal diffusion prior, we introduce a general and scalable framework for solving video inverse problems. We then apply our framework to two challenging scientific video inverse problems--black hole imaging and dynamic MRI. Our framework enables the generation of diverse, high-fidelity video reconstructions that not only fit observations but also recover multi-modal solutions. By incorporating a spatiotemporal diffusion prior, we significantly improve our ability to capture complex temporal relationships in the data while also enhancing spatial fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhang, Xuhui Zheng, Xuecheng Wu, Chong Peng, Xuezhi Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, existing evaluation methodologies for vision-language alignment still struggle with the fine-grained semantic matching. Current approaches based on global similarity metrics often overlook critical token-level correspondences between textual descriptions and visual content. To this end, we present TokenFocus-VQA, a novel evaluation framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through visual question answering (VQA) paradigm with position-specific probability optimization. Our key innovation lies in designing a token-aware loss function that selectively focuses on probability distributions at pre-defined vocabulary positions corresponding to crucial semantic elements, enabling precise measurement of fine-grained semantical alignment. The proposed framework further integrates ensemble learning techniques to aggregate multi-perspective assessments from diverse LVLMs architectures, thereby achieving further performance enhancement. Evaluated on the NTIRE 2025 T2I Quality Assessment Challenge Track 1, our TokenFocus-VQA ranks 2nd place (0.8445, only 0.0001 lower than the 1st method) on public evaluation and 2nd place (0.8426) on the official private test set, demonstrating superiority in capturing nuanced text-image correspondences compared to conventional evaluation methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We benchmark foundation models image embeddings for classification and retrieval in e-Commerce, evaluating their suitability for real-world applications. Our study spans embeddings from pre-trained convolutional and transformer models trained via supervised, self-supervised, and text-image contrastive learning. We assess full fine-tuning and transfer learning (top-tuning) on six diverse e-Commerce datasets: fashion, consumer goods, cars, food, and retail. Results show full fine-tuning consistently performs well, while text-image and self-supervised embeddings can match its performance with less training. While supervised embeddings remain stable across architectures, SSL and contrastive embeddings vary significantly, often benefiting from top-tuning. Top-tuning emerges as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs. We also explore cross-tuning, noting its impact depends on dataset characteristics. Our findings offer practical guidelines for embedding selection and fine-tuning strategies, balancing efficiency and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian Cosma, Andy C\v{a}trun\v{a}, Emilian R\v{a}doi</p>
<p>Abstract: Gait recognition from video streams is a challenging problem in computer vision biometrics due to the subtle differences between gaits and numerous confounding factors. Recent advancements in self-supervised pretraining have led to the development of robust gait recognition models that are invariant to walking covariates. While neural scaling laws have transformed model development in other domains by linking performance to data, model size, and compute, their applicability to gait remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study scaling on skeleton-based self-supervised gait recognition to quantify the effect of data quantity, model size and compute on downstream gait recognition performance. We pretrain multiple variants of GaitPT - a transformer-based architecture - on a dataset of 2.7 million walking sequences collected in the wild. We evaluate zero-shot performance across four benchmark datasets to derive scaling laws for data, model size, and compute. Our findings demonstrate predictable power-law improvements in performance with increased scale and confirm that data and compute scaling significantly influence downstream accuracy. We further isolate architectural contributions by comparing GaitPT with GaitFormer under controlled compute budgets. These results provide practical insights into resource allocation and performance estimation for real-world gait recognition systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngwan Jin, Michal Kovac, Yagiz Nalcakan, Hyeongjin Ju, Hanbin Song, Sanghyeop Yeo, Shiho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum, which is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain, snow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued progress in the vision-language RL community.

<p>Abstract: Facial expression detection involves two interrelated tasks: spotting, which identifies the onset and offset of expressions, and recognition, which classifies them into emotional categories. Most existing methods treat these tasks separately using a two-step training pipelines. A spotting model first detects expression intervals. A recognition model then classifies the detected segments. However, this sequential approach leads to error propagation, inefficient feature learning, and suboptimal performance due to the lack of joint optimization of the two tasks. We propose FEDN, an end-to-end Facial Expression Detection Network that jointly optimizes spotting and recognition. Our model introduces a novel attention-based feature extraction module, incorporating segment attention and sliding window attention to improve facial feature learning. By unifying two tasks within a single network, we greatly reduce error propagation and enhance overall performance. Experiments on CASME}^2 and CASME^3 demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for both spotting and detection, underscoring the benefits of joint optimization for robust facial expression detection in long videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujin Wang, Jiarui Wu, Yichen Bian, Fan Zhang, Tianfan Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: The generalization of learning-based high dynamic range (HDR) fusion is often limited by the availability of training data, as collecting large-scale HDR images from dynamic scenes is both costly and technically challenging. To address these challenges, we propose S2R-HDR, the first large-scale high-quality synthetic dataset for HDR fusion, with 24,000 HDR samples. Using Unreal Engine 5, we design a diverse set of realistic HDR scenes that encompass various dynamic elements, motion types, high dynamic range scenes, and lighting. Additionally, we develop an efficient rendering pipeline to generate realistic HDR images. To further mitigate the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, we introduce S2R-Adapter, a domain adaptation designed to bridge this gap and enhance the generalization ability of models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anne-Sofie Maerten, Li-Wei Chen, Stefanie De Winter, Christophe Bossens, Johan Wagemans</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Leuven Art Personalized Image Set (LAPIS), a novel dataset for personalized image aesthetic assessment (PIAA). It is the first dataset with images of artworks that is suitable for PIAA. LAPIS consists of 11,723 images and was meticulously curated in collaboration with art historians. Each image has an aesthetics score and a set of image attributes known to relate to aesthetic appreciation. Besides rich image attributes, LAPIS offers rich personal attributes of each annotator. We implemented two existing state-of-the-art PIAA models and assessed their performance on LAPIS. We assess the contribution of personal attributes and image attributes through ablation studies and find that performance deteriorates when certain personal and image attributes are removed. An analysis of failure cases reveals that both existing models make similar incorrect predictions, highlighting the need for improvements in artistic image aesthetic assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Wang, Zhong Qian, Peifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: News media, particularly video-based platforms, have become deeply embedded in daily life, concurrently amplifying risks of misinformation dissemination. Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public engagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets often politically or virally motivated pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel dataset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture integrating CLIP and Faster R-CNN for video feature extraction, enhanced by co-attention mechanisms for feature refinement and multimodal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generalization capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detection efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for detecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing methodologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Ma, Hao Chen, Wei Zeng, Limin Su, Shiliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained text-to-image retrieval aims to retrieve a fine-grained target image with a given text query. Existing methods typically assume that each training image is accurately depicted by its textual descriptions. However, textual descriptions can be ambiguous and fail to depict discriminative visual details in images, leading to inaccurate representation learning. To alleviate the effects of text ambiguity, we propose a Multi-Modal Reference learning framework to learn robust representations. We first propose a multi-modal reference construction module to aggregate all visual and textual details of the same object into a comprehensive multi-modal reference. The multi-modal reference hence facilitates the subsequent representation learning and retrieval similarity computation. Specifically, a reference-guided representation learning module is proposed to use multi-modal references to learn more accurate visual and textual representations. Additionally, we introduce a reference-based refinement method that employs the object references to compute a reference-based similarity that refines the initial retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted on five fine-grained text-to-image retrieval datasets for different text-to-image retrieval tasks. The proposed method has achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on the text-to-person image retrieval dataset RSTPReid, our method achieves the Rank1 accuracy of 56.2\%, surpassing the recent CFine by 5.6\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicole Tran, Anisa Prasad, Yan Zhuang, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Boah Kim, Sydney Lewis, Pritam Mukherjee, Jianfei Liu, Ronald M. Summers</p>
<p>Abstract: The segmentation of multiple organs in multi-parametric MRI studies is critical for many applications in radiology, such as correlating imaging biomarkers with disease status (e.g., cirrhosis, diabetes). Recently, three publicly available tools, such as MRSegmentator (MRSeg), TotalSegmentator MRI (TS), and TotalVibeSegmentator (VIBE), have been proposed for multi-organ segmentation in MRI. However, the performance of these tools on specific MRI sequence types has not yet been quantified. In this work, a subset of 40 volumes from the public Duke Liver Dataset was curated. The curated dataset contained 10 volumes each from the pre-contrast fat saturated T1, arterial T1w, venous T1w, and delayed T1w phases, respectively. Ten abdominal structures were manually annotated in these volumes. Next, the performance of the three public tools was benchmarked on this curated dataset. The results indicated that MRSeg obtained a Dice score of 80.7 $\pm$ 18.6 and Hausdorff Distance (HD) error of 8.9 $\pm$ 10.4 mm. It fared the best ($p < .05$) across the different sequence types in contrast to TS and VIBE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time wildlife detection in drone imagery is critical for numerous applications, including animal ecology, conservation, and biodiversity monitoring. Low-altitude drone missions are effective for collecting fine-grained animal movement and behavior data, particularly if missions are automated for increased speed and consistency. However, little work exists on evaluating computer vision models on low-altitude aerial imagery and generalizability across different species and settings. To fill this gap, we present a novel multi-environment, multi-species, low-altitude aerial footage (MMLA) dataset. MMLA consists of drone footage collected across three diverse environments: Ol Pejeta Conservancy and Mpala Research Centre in Kenya, and The Wilds Conservation Center in Ohio, which includes five species: Plains zebras, Grevy's zebras, giraffes, onagers, and African Painted Dogs. We comprehensively evaluate three YOLO models (YOLOv5m, YOLOv8m, and YOLOv11m) for detecting animals. Results demonstrate significant performance disparities across locations and species-specific detection variations. Our work highlights the importance of evaluating detection algorithms across different environments for robust wildlife monitoring applications using drones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangliu Hu, Zikai Song, Na Feng, Yawei Luo, Junqing Yu, Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have witnessed substantial advancements in recent years, propelled by the advancement in multi-modal LLMs. Although these models have demonstrated proficiency in providing the overall description of videos, they struggle with fine-grained understanding, particularly in aspects such as visual dynamics and video details inquiries. To tackle these shortcomings, we find that fine-tuning Video-LLMs on self-supervised fragment tasks, greatly improve their fine-grained video understanding abilities. Hence we propose two key contributions:(1) Self-Supervised Fragment Fine-Tuning (SF$^2$T), a novel effortless fine-tuning method, employs the rich inherent characteristics of videos for training, while unlocking more fine-grained understanding ability of Video-LLMs. Moreover, it relieves researchers from labor-intensive annotations and smartly circumvents the limitations of natural language, which often fails to capture the complex spatiotemporal variations in videos; (2) A novel benchmark dataset, namely FineVidBench, for rigorously assessing Video-LLMs' performance at both the scene and fragment levels, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities. We assessed multiple models and validated the effectiveness of SF$^2$T on them. Experimental results reveal that our approach improves their ability to capture and interpret spatiotemporal details.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangfan Zhou, Chu Zhou, Youwei Lyu, Heng Guo, Zhanyu Ma, Boxin Shi, Imari Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: Polarization cameras can capture multiple polarized images with different polarizer angles in a single shot, bringing convenience to polarization-based downstream tasks. However, their direct outputs are color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw images, requiring demosaicing to reconstruct full-resolution, full-color polarized images; unfortunately, this necessary step introduces artifacts that make polarization-related parameters such as the degree of polarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP) prone to error. Besides, limited by the hardware design, the resolution of a polarization camera is often much lower than that of a conventional RGB camera. Existing polarized image demosaicing (PID) methods are limited in that they cannot enhance resolution, while polarized image super-resolution (PISR) methods, though designed to obtain high-resolution (HR) polarized images from the demosaicing results, tend to retain or even amplify errors in the DoP and AoP introduced by demosaicing artifacts. In this paper, we propose PIDSR, a joint framework that performs complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution, showing the ability to robustly obtain high-quality HR polarized images with more accurate DoP and AoP from a CPFA raw image in a direct manner. Experiments show our PIDSR not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real data, but also facilitates downstream tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07761">Exploring a Patch-Wise Approach for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Mu\~noz-Haro, Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez</p>
<p>Abstract: In an increasingly digitalized world, verifying the authenticity of ID documents has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, no publicly available data from real ID documents exists, and most studies rely on proprietary in-house databases that are not available due to privacy reasons. In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that makes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy (i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection. Our proposed approach explores how privacy can be enhanced through: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID document (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. Also, state-of-the-art methods such as Vision Transformers and Foundation Models are considered in the analysis. The experimental framework shows that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at patch and ID document level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to this exploration, another key contribution of our study is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from both real and fake ID documents, along with the experimental framework and models, which will be available in our GitHub.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07785">Towards Micro-Action Recognition with Limited Annotations: An Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Zhang, Lechao Cheng, Yaxiong Wang, Zhun Zhong, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) aims to classify subtle human actions in video. However, annotating MAR datasets is particularly challenging due to the subtlety of actions. To this end, we introduce the setting of Semi-Supervised MAR (SSMAR), where only a part of samples are labeled. We first evaluate traditional Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods to SSMAR and find that these methods tend to overfit on inaccurate pseudo-labels, leading to error accumulation and degraded performance. This issue primarily arises from the common practice of directly using the predictions of classifier as pseudo-labels to train the model. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Asynchronous Pseudo Labeling and Training (APLT), which explicitly separates the pseudo-labeling process from model training. Specifically, we introduce a semi-supervised clustering method during the offline pseudo-labeling phase to generate more accurate pseudo-labels. Moreover, a self-adaptive thresholding strategy is proposed to dynamically filter noisy labels of different classes. We then build a memory-based prototype classifier based on the filtered pseudo-labels, which is fixed and used to guide the subsequent model training phase. By alternating the two pseudo-labeling and model training phases in an asynchronous manner, the model can not only be learned with more accurate pseudo-labels but also avoid the overfitting issue. Experiments on three MAR datasets show that our APLT largely outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods. For instance, APLT improves accuracy by 14.5\% over FixMatch on the MA-12 dataset when using only 50\% labeled data. Code will be publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07792">Breaking the Barriers: Video Vision Transformers for Word-Level Sign Language Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Brettmann, Jakob Gr\"avinghoff, Marlene R\"uschoff, Marie Westhues</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language is a fundamental means of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) community, enabling nuanced expression through gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. Despite its critical role in facilitating interaction within the DHH population, significant barriers persist due to the limited fluency in sign language among the hearing population. Overcoming this communication gap through automatic sign language recognition (SLR) remains a challenge, particularly at a dynamic word-level, where temporal and spatial dependencies must be effectively recognized. While Convolutional Neural Networks have shown potential in SLR, they are computationally intensive and have difficulties in capturing global temporal dependencies between video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model for word-level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Transformer models make use of self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture global relationships across spatial and temporal dimensions, which makes them suitable for complex gesture recognition tasks. The VideoMAE model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 75.58% on the WLASL100 dataset, highlighting its strong performance compared to traditional CNNs with 65.89%. Our study demonstrates that transformer-based architectures have great potential to advance SLR, overcome communication barriers and promote the inclusion of DHH individuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Torres, Joan Duran, Julia Navarro, Catalina Sbert</p>
<p>Abstract: Images captured under low-light conditions present significant limitations in many applications, as poor lighting can obscure details, reduce contrast, and hide noise. Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition. Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Chen, Xuehui Yu, Xumeng Han, Kuiran Wang, Guorong Li, Lingxi Xie, Zhenjun Han, Jianbin Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Object recognition using single-point supervision has attracted increasing attention recently. However, the performance gap compared with fully-supervised algorithms remains large. Previous works generated class-agnostic \textbf{\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed candidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning (MIL). In this paper, we introduce Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which constructs balanced \textbf{\textit{instance-level proposal bags}} by generating proposals in an anchor-like way and refining the proposals in a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Through further research, we find that the bag of proposals, either at the image level or the instance level, is established on discrete box sampling. This leads the pseudo box estimation into a sub-optimal solution, resulting in the truncation of object boundaries or the excessive inclusion of background. Hence, we conduct a series exploration of discrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask Network (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal sampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues. P2MNet further introduces low-level image information to assist in pixel prediction, and a boundary self-prediction is designed to relieve the limitation of the estimated boxes. Benefiting from the continuous object-aware \textbf{\textit{pixel-level perception}}, P2MNet can generate more precise bounding boxes and generalize to segmentation tasks. Our method largely surpasses the previous methods in terms of the mean average precision on COCO, VOC, SBD, and Cityscapes, demonstrating great potential to bridge the performance gap compared with fully supervised tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayin Zhao, Zhenqi Fu, Tao Yu, Hui Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to capture snapshot-based, large-scale 3D fluorescence images. However, existing LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or require hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based framework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image denoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the LF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view being independent. This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of noise2noise for effective denoising. To enhance the recovery of high-frequency details, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique, which transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in wave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature alignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their corresponding 3D intensity volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. These advancements position V2V3D as a promising solution for 3D imaging under challenging conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Li, Fernando Jose Pena Cantu, Emily Yu, Alexander Wong, Yuchen Cui, Yuhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) is an important topic in understanding dynamic kitchen environments. Current models for VidSGG require extensive training to produce scene graphs. Recently, Vision Language Models (VLM) and Vision Foundation Models (VFM) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of tasks. However, VLMs like Gemini struggle with the dynamics for VidSGG, failing to maintain stable object identities across frames. To overcome this limitation, we propose SAMJAM, a zero-shot pipeline that combines SAM2's temporal tracking with Gemini's semantic understanding. SAM2 also improves upon Gemini's object grounding by producing more accurate bounding boxes. In our method, we first prompt Gemini to generate a frame-level scene graph. Then, we employ a matching algorithm to map each object in the scene graph with a SAM2-generated or SAM2-propagated mask, producing a temporally-consistent scene graph in dynamic environments. Finally, we repeat this process again in each of the following frames. We empirically demonstrate that SAMJAM outperforms Gemini by 8.33% in mean recall on the EPIC-KITCHENS and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07934">SoTA with Less: MCTS-Guided Sample Selection for Data-Efficient Visual Reasoning Self-Improvement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyao Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Chao Feng, Hongjin Lu, Linjie Li, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Furong Huang, Lijuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an effective method to enhance visual reasoning with significantly fewer training samples, relying purely on self-improvement with no knowledge distillation. Our key insight is that the difficulty of training data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical. Appropriately challenging samples can substantially boost reasoning capabilities even when the dataset is small. Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in accurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering. To this end, we propose a novel way of repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve that. Starting from our curated 70k open-source training samples, we introduce an MCTS-based selection method that quantifies sample difficulty based on the number of iterations required by the VLMs to solve each problem. This explicit step-by-step reasoning in MCTS enforces the model to think longer and better identifies samples that are genuinely challenging. We filter and retain 11k samples to perform RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, resulting in our final model, ThinkLite-VL. Evaluation results on eight benchmarks show that ThinkLite-VL improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7%, using only 11k training samples with no knowledge distillation. This significantly outperforms all existing 7B-level reasoning VLMs, and our fairly comparable baselines that use classic selection methods such as accuracy-based filtering. Notably, on MathVista, ThinkLite-VL-7B achieves the SoTA accuracy of 75.1, surpassing Qwen2.5-VL-72B, GPT-4o, and O1.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rundong Luo, Matthew Wallingford, Ali Farhadi, Noah Snavely, Wei-Chiu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: 360{\deg} videos have emerged as a promising medium to represent our dynamic visual world. Compared to the "tunnel vision" of standard cameras, their borderless field of view offers a more complete perspective of our surroundings. While existing video models excel at producing standard videos, their ability to generate full panoramic videos remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the task of video-to-360{\deg} generation: given a perspective video as input, our goal is to generate a full panoramic video that is consistent with the original video. Unlike conventional video generation tasks, the output's field of view is significantly larger, and the model is required to have a deep understanding of both the spatial layout of the scene and the dynamics of objects to maintain spatio-temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we first leverage the abundant 360{\deg} videos available online and develop a high-quality data filtering pipeline to curate pairwise training data. We then carefully design a series of geometry- and motion-aware operations to facilitate the learning process and improve the quality of 360{\deg} video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate realistic and coherent 360{\deg} videos from in-the-wild perspective video. In addition, we showcase its potential applications, including video stabilization, camera viewpoint control, and interactive visual question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nico Catalano, Stefano Samele, Paolo Pertino, Matteo Matteucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Few Shot Segmentation literature lacks a mask selection method that goes beyond visual similarity between the query and example images, leading to suboptimal predictions. We present MARS, a plug-and-play ranking system that leverages multimodal cues to filter and merge mask proposals robustly. Starting from a set of mask predictions for a single query image, we score, filter, and merge them to improve results. Proposals are evaluated using multimodal scores computed at local and global levels. Extensive experiments on COCO-20i, Pascal-5i, LVIS-92i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate that integrating all four scoring components is crucial for robust ranking, validating our contribution. As MARS can be effortlessly integrated with various mask proposal systems, we deploy it across a wide range of top-performer methods and achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple existing benchmarks. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhan Yang, Yuan-Chen Guo, Yukun Huang, Zi-Xin Zou, Zhipeng Yu, Yangguang Li, Yan-Pei Cao, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D part amodal segmentation--decomposing a 3D shape into complete, semantically meaningful parts, even when occluded--is a challenging but crucial task for 3D content creation and understanding. Existing 3D part segmentation methods only identify visible surface patches, limiting their utility. Inspired by 2D amodal segmentation, we introduce this novel task to the 3D domain and propose a practical, two-stage approach, addressing the key challenges of inferring occluded 3D geometry, maintaining global shape consistency, and handling diverse shapes with limited training data. First, we leverage existing 3D part segmentation to obtain initial, incomplete part segments. Second, we introduce HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model, to complete these segments into full 3D parts. HoloPart utilizes a specialized architecture with local attention to capture fine-grained part geometry and global shape context attention to ensure overall shape consistency. We introduce new benchmarks based on the ABO and PartObjaverse-Tiny datasets and demonstrate that HoloPart significantly outperforms state-of-the-art shape completion methods. By incorporating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, we achieve promising results on 3D part amodal segmentation, opening new avenues for applications in geometry editing, animation, and material assignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yu, Rupayan Mallick, Margrit Betke, Sarah Adel Bargal</p>
<p>Abstract: Cartoon avatars have been widely used in various applications, including social media, online tutoring, and gaming. However, existing cartoon avatar datasets and generation methods struggle to present highly expressive avatars with fine-grained facial expressions and are often inspired from real-world identities, raising privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with fine-grained facial expressions. Our approach fine-tunes a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize highly detailed and expressive facial expressions. We then incorporate a stylization model that transforms these realistic faces into cartoon avatars while preserving both identity and expression. Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive cartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135 fine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars with a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL. We also verify that the cartoon avatars generated by our framework do not include memorized identities from fine-tuning data. The proposed framework and dataset provide a diverse and expressive benchmark for future research in cartoon avatar generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kefan Chen, Sergiu Oprea, Justin Theiss, Sreyas Mohan, Srinath Sridhar, Aayush Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rising interest from the community in digital avatars coupled with the importance of expressions and gestures in communication, modeling natural avatar behavior remains an important challenge across many industries such as teleconferencing, gaming, and AR/VR. Human hands are the primary tool for interacting with the environment and essential for realistic human behavior modeling, yet existing 3D hand and head avatar models often overlook the crucial aspect of hand-body interactions, such as between hand and face. We present InteracttAvatar, the first model to faithfully capture the photorealistic appearance of dynamic hand and non-rigid hand-face interactions. Our novel Dynamic Gaussian Hand model, combining template model and 3D Gaussian Splatting as well as a dynamic refinement module, captures pose-dependent change, e.g. the fine wrinkles and complex shadows that occur during articulation. Importantly, our hand-face interaction module models the subtle geometry and appearance dynamics that underlie common gestures. Through experiments of novel view synthesis, self reenactment and cross-identity reenactment, we demonstrate that InteracttAvatar can reconstruct hand and hand-face interactions from monocular or multiview videos with high-fidelity details and be animated with novel poses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Shukor, Enrico Fini, Victor Guilherme Turrisi da Costa, Matthieu Cord, Joshua Susskind, Alaaeldin El-Nouby</p>
<p>Abstract: Building general-purpose models that can effectively perceive the world through multimodal signals has been a long-standing goal. Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those trained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows for models that learn modality-specific weights, significantly enhancing performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1, we explore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) in MLLM post-training for perception policy learning. While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanhong Yu, Xingyi He, Chen Zhao, Junhao Yu, Jiaqi Yang, Ruizhen Hu, Yujun Shen, Xing Zhu, Xiaowei Zhou, Sida Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a generalizable RGB-based approach for object pose estimation, specifically designed to address challenges in sparse-view settings. While existing methods can estimate the poses of unseen objects, their generalization ability remains limited in scenarios involving occlusions and sparse reference views, restricting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce corner points of the object bounding box as an intermediate representation of the object pose. The 3D object corners can be reliably recovered from sparse input views, while the 2D corner points in the target view are estimated through a novel reference-based point synthesizer, which works well even in scenarios involving occlusions. As object semantic points, object corners naturally establish 2D-3D correspondences for object pose estimation with a PnP algorithm. Extensive experiments on the YCB-Video and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and significantly enhancing the generalization capabilities of object pose estimation, which is crucial for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Qi, Yiming Zhao, Yu Zeng, Xikun Bao, Wenxuan Huang, Lin Chen, Zehui Chen, Jie Zhao, Zhongang Qi, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyuan Ding, Shenxi Wu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuhang Zang, Haodong Duan, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Cao, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Instruction Following (IF) ability measures how well Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand exactly what users are telling them and whether they are doing it right. Existing multimodal instruction following training data is scarce, the benchmarks are simple with atomic instructions, and the evaluation strategies are imprecise for tasks demanding exact output constraints. To address this, we present MM-IFEngine, an effective pipeline to generate high-quality image-instruction pairs. Our MM-IFEngine pipeline yields large-scale, diverse, and high-quality training data MM-IFInstruct-23k, which is suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and extended as MM-IFDPO-23k for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We further introduce MM-IFEval, a challenging and diverse multi-modal instruction-following benchmark that includes (1) both compose-level constraints for output responses and perception-level constraints tied to the input images, and (2) a comprehensive evaluation pipeline incorporating both rule-based assessment and judge model. We conduct SFT and DPO experiments and demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs on MM-IFInstruct-23k and MM-IFDPO-23k achieves notable gains on various IF benchmarks, such as MM-IFEval (+10.2$\%$), MIA (+7.6$\%$), and IFEval (+12.3$\%$).

<p>Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning in close-set 3D object detection, existing approaches struggle with zero-shot generalization to novel objects and camera configurations. We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyoung Kim, Mahmoud Afifi, Dongyun Kim, Michael S. Brown, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational color constancy, or white balancing, is a key module in a camera's image signal processor (ISP) that corrects color casts from scene lighting. Because this operation occurs in the camera-specific raw color space, white balance algorithms must adapt to different cameras. This paper introduces a learning-based method for cross-camera color constancy that generalizes to new cameras without retraining. Our method leverages pre-calibrated color correction matrices (CCMs) available on ISPs that map the camera's raw color space to a standard space (e.g., CIE XYZ). Our method uses these CCMs to transform predefined illumination colors (i.e., along the Planckian locus) into the test camera's raw space. The mapped illuminants are encoded into a compact camera fingerprint embedding (CFE) that enables the network to adapt to unseen cameras. To prevent overfitting due to limited cameras and CCMs during training, we introduce a data augmentation technique that interpolates between cameras and their CCMs. Experimental results across multiple datasets and backbones show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-camera color constancy while remaining lightweight and relying only on data readily available in camera ISPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhong-Yu Li, Ruoyi Du, Juncheng Yan, Le Zhuo, Zhen Li, Peng Gao, Zhanyu Ma, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models significantly advances various image generation tasks. However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p>

By leveraging the strong dynamic prior captured by such video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, depth, and ray maps. It uses a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as multiple sliding windows, at inference time, thus obtaining robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods, including recent methods such as MonST3R, which are also designed to handle dynamic scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Lin, Xueyang Yu, Ziqi Pang, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework utilizing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for referring video object segmentation (RefVOS). Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between "Ref" and "VOS": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse "context frames" provides global information, while a stream of continuous "query frames" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Zou, Lizhen Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), powered by Transformer networks, has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, computer vision, and graphics. However, the application of Transformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing boundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT), a novel method adapting Transformer for B-rep learning. B-rep models pose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric definitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete data Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous geometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed) into B\'ezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without discretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method that organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens suitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological characteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention mechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of boundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature recognition tasks.</p>

Unlike conventional diffusion-based SR models that apply a uniform denoising process across the entire image, MoEDiff-SR dynamically selects specialized denoising experts at a fine-grained token level, ensuring region-specific adaptation and enhanced SR performance. Specifically, our approach first employs a Transformer-based feature extractor to compute multi-scale patch embeddings, capturing both global structural information and local texture details. The extracted feature embeddings are then fed into an MoE gating network, which assigns adaptive weights to multiple diffusion-based denoisers, each specializing in different brain MRI characteristics, such as centrum semiovale, sulcal and gyral cortex, and grey-white matter junction. The final output is produced by aggregating the denoised results from these specialized experts according to dynamically assigned gating probabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MoEDiff-SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative image quality metrics, perceptual fidelity, and computational efficiency. Difference maps from each expert further highlight their distinct specializations, confirming the effective region-specific denoising capability and the interpretability of expert contributions. Additionally, clinical evaluation validates its superior diagnostic capability in identifying subtle pathological features, emphasizing its practical relevance in clinical neuroimaging.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Lamine Benomar, Nesma Settouti, Eric Debreuve, Xavier Descombes, Damien Ambrosetti</p>
<p>Abstract: The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Chen, James Wang, Alan McMillan</p>
<p>Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging requires accurate attenuation correction (AC) to account for photon loss due to tissue density variations. In PET/MR systems, computed tomography (CT), which offers a straightforward estimation of AC is not available. This study presents a deep learning approach to generate synthetic CT (sCT) images directly from Time-of-Flight (TOF) non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images, enhancing AC for PET/MR. We first evaluated models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets for a CT-to-CT reconstruction task, finding that the pre-trained model outperformed those trained solely on medical datasets. The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned using an institutional dataset of 35 TOF NAC PET and CT volume pairs, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 74.49 HU and highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.66 dB within the body contour region. Visual assessments demonstrated improved reconstruction of both bone and soft tissue structures from TOF NAC PET images. This work highlights the effectiveness of using pre-trained deep learning models for medical image translation tasks. Future work will assess the impact of sCT on PET attenuation correction and explore additional neural network architectures and datasets to further enhance performance and practical applications in PET imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santanu Roy, Ashvath Suresh, Palak Sahu, Tulika Rudra Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pooling-based VGG-Lite model in order to mitigate class imbalance issues in Chest X-Ray (CXR) datasets. Automatic Pneumonia detection from CXR images by deep learning model has emerged as a prominent and dynamic area of research, since the inception of the new Covid-19 variant in 2020. However, the standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models encounter challenges associated with class imbalance, a prevalent issue found in many medical datasets. The innovations introduced in the proposed model architecture include: (I) A very lightweight CNN model, `VGG-Lite', is proposed as a base model, inspired by VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2 architecture. (II) On top of this base model, we leverage an ``Edge Enhanced Module (EEM)" through a parallel branch, consisting of a ``negative image layer", and a novel custom pooling layer ``2Max-Min Pooling". This 2Max-Min Pooling layer is entirely novel in this investigation, providing more attention to edge components within pneumonia CXR images. Thus, it works as an efficient spatial attention module (SAM). We have implemented the proposed framework on two separate CXR datasets. The first dataset is obtained from a readily available source on the internet, and the second dataset is a more challenging CXR dataset, assembled by our research team from three different sources. Experimental results reveal that our proposed framework has outperformed pre-trained CNN models, and three recent trend existing models ``Vision Transformer", ``Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)'' and ``PneuNet", by substantial margins on both datasets. The proposed framework VGG-Lite with EEM, has achieved a macro average of 95% accuracy, 97.1% precision, 96.1% recall, and 96.6% F1 score on the ``Pneumonia Imbalance CXR dataset", without employing any pre-processing technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Rempe, Fabian H\"orst, Helmut Becker, Marco Schlimbach, Lukas Rotkopf, Kevin Kr\"oninger, Jens Kleesiek</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) raw data, or k-Space data, is complex-valued, containing both magnitude and phase information. However, clinical and existing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods focus only on magnitude images, discarding the phase data despite its potential for downstream tasks, such as tumor segmentation and classification. In this work, we introduce $\textit{PhaseGen}$, a novel complex-valued diffusion model for generating synthetic MRI raw data conditioned on magnitude images, commonly used in clinical practice. This enables the creation of artificial complex-valued raw data, allowing pretraining for models that require k-Space information. We evaluate PhaseGen on two tasks: skull-stripping directly in k-Space and MRI reconstruction using the publicly available FastMRI dataset. Our results show that training with synthetic phase data significantly improves generalization for skull-stripping on real-world data, with an increased segmentation accuracy from $41.1\%$ to $80.1\%$, and enhances MRI reconstruction when combined with limited real-world data. This work presents a step forward in utilizing generative AI to bridge the gap between magnitude-based datasets and the complex-valued nature of MRI raw data. This approach allows researchers to leverage the vast amount of avaliable image domain data in combination with the information-rich k-Space data for more accurate and efficient diagnostic tasks. We make our code publicly $\href{https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/PhaseGen}{\text{available here}}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Liu, Teng Tu, Yunshan Ma, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Music profoundly enhances video production by improving quality, engagement, and emotional resonance, sparking growing interest in video-to-music generation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches remain limited in specific scenarios or undervalue the visual dynamics. To address these limitations, we focus on tackling the complexity of dynamics and resolving temporal misalignment between video and music representations. To this end, we propose DyViM, a novel framework to enhance dynamics modeling for video-to-music generation. Specifically, we extract frame-wise dynamics features via a simplified motion encoder inherited from optical flow methods, followed by a self-attention module for aggregation within frames. These dynamic features are then incorporated to extend existing music tokens for temporal alignment. Additionally, high-level semantics are conveyed through a cross-attention mechanism, and an annealing tuning strategy benefits to fine-tune well-trained music decoders efficiently, therefore facilitating seamless adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate DyViM's superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Bell-Navas, Mar\'ia Villalba-Orero, Enrique Lara-Pezzi, Jes\'us Garicano-Mena, Soledad Le Clainche</p>
<p>Abstract: Heart diseases constitute the main cause of international human defunction. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 18 million deaths happen each year due to precisely heart diseases. In particular, heart failures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early, rapid and effective prediction. In this work, an automatic system which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences is proposed for the challenging and more specific task of prediction of heart failure times. This system is based on a novel deep learning framework, and works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography video sequences into a machine learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training phase of any kind of machine learning-based framework, including a deep learning one. This initial stage includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT). Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which have been so far barely explored in the literature about heart failure prediction, are applied to effectively train the ViT from scratch, even with scarce databases of echocardiograms. The designed neural network analyses images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the time in which a heart failure will happen. The results obtained show the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of the proposed system with respect to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CollEx, an innovative multimodal agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance interactive exploration of extensive scientific collections. Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hye-Min Won, Jieun Lee, Jiyong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation in complex indoor environments. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware localization method that enhances the reliability of localization outputs without modifying the prediction model itself. This study introduces a percentile-based rejection strategy that filters out unreliable 3-DoF pose predictions based on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties the network estimates. We apply this approach to a multi-modal end-to-end localization that fuses RGB images and 2D LiDAR data, and we evaluate it across three real-world datasets collected using a commercialized serving robot. Experimental results show that applying stricter uncertainty thresholds consistently improves pose accuracy. Specifically, the mean position error is reduced by 41.0%, 56.7%, and 69.4%, and the mean orientation error by 55.6%, 65.7%, and 73.3%, when applying 90%, 80%, and 70% thresholds, respectively. Furthermore, the rejection strategy effectively removes extreme outliers, resulting in better alignment with ground truth trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively demonstrate the benefits of percentile-based uncertainty rejection in multi-modal end-to-end localization tasks. Our approach provides a practical means to enhance the reliability and accuracy of localization systems in real-world deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanglin Huang, Kai Hu, Yuan Zhang, Zhineng Chen, Xieping Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Current knowledge distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation focus on guiding the student to imitate the teacher's knowledge within homogeneous architectures. However, these methods overlook the diverse knowledge contained in architectures with different inductive biases, which is crucial for enabling the student to acquire a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the data during distillation. To this end, we propose for the first time a generic knowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous perspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between heterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring cross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the influence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of both the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits space. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous architectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a teacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student knowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are performed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between heterogeneous teacher-student knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on three main-stream benchmarks using various teacher-student pairs demonstrate that our HeteroAKD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in facilitating distillation between heterogeneous architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zini Chen, Yao Xiao, Junyan Zhang, Shaoyu Wang, Liu Shi, Qiegen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view sampling in dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) significantly reduces radiation dose and increases imaging speed, yet is highly prone to artifacts. Although diffusion models have demonstrated potential in effectively handling incomplete data, most existing methods in this field focus on the image do-main and lack global constraints, which consequently leads to insufficient reconstruction quality. In this study, we propose a dual-domain virtual-mask in-formed diffusion model for sparse-view reconstruction by leveraging the high inter-channel correlation in DECT. Specifically, the study designs a virtual mask and applies it to the high-energy and low-energy data to perform perturbation operations, thus constructing high-dimensional tensors that serve as the prior information of the diffusion model. In addition, a dual-domain collaboration strategy is adopted to integrate the information of the randomly selected high-frequency components in the wavelet domain with the information in the projection domain, for the purpose of optimizing the global struc-tures and local details. Experimental results indicated that the present method exhibits excellent performance across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhuan Zhou, Yuchen Zhang, Ruihong Xu, Xuansen Zhao, Tao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL), a pivotal technology in artificial intelligence, has recently gained substantial traction in the domain of dental auxiliary diagnosis. However, its application has predominantly been confined to imaging modalities such as panoramic radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography, with limited focus on auxiliary analysis specifically targeting Periapical Radiographs (PR). PR are the most extensively utilized imaging modality in endodontics and periodontics due to their capability to capture detailed local lesions at a low cost. Nevertheless, challenges such as resolution limitations and artifacts complicate the annotation and recognition of PR, leading to a scarcity of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality PR analysis datasets. This scarcity has somewhat impeded the advancement of DL applications in PR analysis. In this paper, we present PRAD-10K, a dataset for PR analysis. PRAD-10K comprises 10,000 clinical periapical radiograph images, with pixel-level annotations provided by professional dentists for nine distinct anatomical structures, lesions, and artificial restorations or medical devices, We also include classification labels for images with typical conditions or lesions. Furthermore, we introduce a DL network named PRNet to establish benchmarks for PR segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that PRNet surpasses previous state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models on the PRAD-10K dataset. The codes and dataset will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy, often curable only by surgery. Despite its clinical importance, the diagnosis of FCD is very difficult in MRI because of subtle abnormalities, leading to misdiagnosis. This study investigates the use of 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for FCD detection, using a dataset of 170 subjects (85 FCD patients and 85 controls) composed of T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI scans. In particular, it investigates the benefits obtained from cross-modality transfer learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, in particular Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). ResNet architectures (ResNet-18, -34, and -50) were implemented, employing transfer learning strategies that used pre-trained weights from segmentation tasks. Results indicate that transfer learning significantly enhances classification accuracy (up to 80.3%) and interpretability, as measured by a novel Heat-Score metric, which evaluates the model's focus on clinically relevant regions. Improvements in the Heat-Score metric underscore the model's seizure zone localization capabilities, bringing AI predictions and clinical insights closer together. These results highlight the importance of transfer learning, including cross-modality, and XAI in advancing AI-based medical diagnostics, especially for difficult-to-diagnose pathologies such as FCD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Jia, Ge Li, Bafeng Cheng, Yushan Li, Rongyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications. Likelihood-based deep generative models have historically faced criticism for their unsatisfactory performance in OOD detection, often assigning higher likelihood to OOD data than in-distribution samples when applied to image data. In this work, we demonstrate that likelihood is not inherently flawed. Rather, several properties in the images space prohibit likelihood as a valid detection score. Given a sufficiently good likelihood estimator, specifically using the probability flow formulation of a diffusion model, we show that likelihood-based methods can still perform on par with state-of-the-art methods when applied in the representation space of pre-trained encoders.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Huang, Ke Zhang, Wei Liu, Yuanyuan Wang, Vishal M. Patel, Le Lu, Xu Han, Dakai Jin, Ke Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures in medical images, such as vessels and airway trees, is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, radiotherapy, and surgical planning. However, significant challenges exist in algorithm design when faced with diverse sizes, complex topologies, and (often) incomplete data annotation of these structures. We address these difficulties by proposing a new tubular structure segmentation framework named HarmonySeg. First, we design a deep-to-shallow decoder network featuring flexible convolution blocks with varying receptive fields, which enables the model to effectively adapt to tubular structures of different scales. Second, to highlight potential anatomical regions and improve the recall of small tubular structures, we incorporate vesselness maps as auxiliary information. These maps are aligned with image features through a shallow-and-deep fusion module, which simultaneously eliminates unreasonable candidates to maintain high precision. Finally, we introduce a topology-preserving loss function that leverages contextual and shape priors to balance the growth and suppression of tubular structures, which also allows the model to handle low-quality and incomplete annotations. Extensive quantitative experiments are conducted on four public datasets. The results show that our model can accurately segment 2D and 3D tubular structures and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. External validation on a private dataset also demonstrates good generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is a central component of joint embedding self-supervised learning (SSL). Approaches that work for natural images may not always be effective in medical imaging tasks. This study systematically investigated the impact of data augmentation and preprocessing strategies in SSL for lung ultrasound. Three data augmentation pipelines were assessed: (1) a baseline pipeline commonly used across imaging domains, (2) a novel semantic-preserving pipeline designed for ultrasound, and (3) a distilled set of the most effective transformations from both pipelines. Pretrained models were evaluated on multiple classification tasks: B-line detection, pleural effusion detection, and COVID-19 classification. Experiments revealed that semantics-preserving data augmentation resulted in the greatest performance for COVID-19 classification - a diagnostic task requiring global image context. Cropping-based methods yielded the greatest performance on the B-line and pleural effusion object classification tasks, which require strong local pattern recognition. Lastly, semantics-preserving ultrasound image preprocessing resulted in increased downstream performance for multiple tasks. Guidance regarding data augmentation and preprocessing strategies was synthesized for practitioners working with SSL in ultrasound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongyi Shi, Ge Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many low-dose CT imaging methods rely on supervised learning, which requires a large number of paired noisy and clean images. However, obtaining paired images in clinical practice is challenging. To address this issue, zero-shot self-supervised methods train denoising networks using only the information within a single image, such as ZS-N2N. However, these methods often employ downsampling operations that degrade image resolution. Additionally, the training dataset is inherently constrained to the image itself. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot low-dose CT imaging method based on sinogram flicking, which operates within a single image but generates many copies via random conjugate ray matching. Specifically, two conjugate X-ray pencil beams measure the same path; their expected values should be identical, while their noise levels vary during measurements. By randomly swapping portions of the conjugate X-rays in the sinogram domain, we generate a large set of sinograms with consistent content but varying noise patterns. When displayed dynamically, these sinograms exhibit a flickering effect due to their identical structural content but differing noise patterns-hence the term sinogram flicking. We train the network on pairs of sinograms with the same content but different noise distributions using a lightweight model adapted from ZS-NSN. This process is repeated to obtain the final results. A simulation study demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as ZS-N2N.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Hein, Nicola Cavalcanti, Daniel Suter, Lukas Zingg, Fabio Carrillo, Lilian Calvet, Mazda Farshad, Marc Pollefeys, Nassir Navab, Philipp F\"urnstahl</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art research of traditional computer vision is increasingly leveraged in the surgical domain. A particular focus in computer-assisted surgery is to replace marker-based tracking systems for instrument localization with pure image-based 6DoF pose estimation using deep-learning methods. However, state-of-the-art single-view pose estimation methods do not yet meet the accuracy required for surgical navigation. In this context, we investigate the benefits of multi-view setups for highly accurate and occlusion-robust 6DoF pose estimation of surgical instruments and derive recommendations for an ideal camera system that addresses the challenges in the operating room.
  The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present a multi-camera capture setup consisting of static and head-mounted cameras, which allows us to study the performance of pose estimation methods under various camera configurations. Second, we publish a multi-view RGB-D video dataset of ex-vivo spine surgeries, captured in a surgical wet lab and a real operating theatre and including rich annotations for surgeon, instrument, and patient anatomy. Third, we evaluate three state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view methods for the task of 6DoF pose estimation of surgical instruments and analyze the influence of camera configurations, training data, and occlusions on the pose accuracy and generalization ability. The best method utilizes five cameras in a multi-view pose optimization and achieves an average position and orientation error of 1.01 mm and 0.89{\deg} for a surgical drill as well as 2.79 mm and 3.33{\deg} for a screwdriver under optimal conditions. Our results demonstrate that marker-less tracking of surgical instruments is becoming a feasible alternative to existing marker-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyang Zhao, Yikang Shen, Zhenfang Chen, Mingyu Ding, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph has recently been proposed for comprehensive scene understanding. However, previous works adopt a fully-supervised learning manner, requiring large amounts of pixel-wise densely-annotated data, which is always tedious and expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, we study a new problem of Panoptic Scene Graph Generation from Purely Textual Descriptions (Caption-to-PSG). The key idea is to leverage the large collection of free image-caption data on the Web alone to generate panoptic scene graphs. The problem is very challenging for three constraints: 1) no location priors; 2) no explicit links between visual regions and textual entities; and 3) no pre-defined concept sets. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework TextPSG consisting of four modules, i.e., a region grouper, an entity grounder, a segment merger, and a label generator, with several novel techniques. The region grouper first groups image pixels into different segments and the entity grounder then aligns visual segments with language entities based on the textual description of the segment being referred to. The grounding results can thus serve as pseudo labels enabling the segment merger to learn the segment similarity as well as guiding the label generator to learn object semantics and relation predicates, resulting in a fine-grained structured scene understanding. Our framework is effective, significantly outperforming the baselines and achieving strong out-of-distribution robustness. We perform comprehensive ablation studies to corroborate the effectiveness of our design choices and provide an in-depth analysis to highlight future directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Ma, Yaohui Wang, Xinyuan Chen, Gengyun Jia, Ziwei Liu, Yuan-Fang Li, Cunjian Chen, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel Latent Diffusion Transformer, namely Latte, for video generation. Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In addition, we extend Latte to text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte achieves comparable results compared to recent T2V models. We strongly believe that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Fu, Long Lian, Renhao Wang, Baifeng Shi, Xudong Wang, Adam Yala, Trevor Darrell, Alexei A. Efros, Ken Goldberg</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of inter-patch dependencies in the decoder of masked autoencoders (MAE) on representation learning. We decompose the decoding mechanism for masked reconstruction into self-attention between mask tokens and cross-attention between masked and visible tokens. Our findings reveal that MAE reconstructs coherent images from visible patches not through interactions between patches in the decoder but by learning a global representation within the encoder. This discovery leads us to propose a simple visual pretraining framework: cross-attention masked autoencoders (CrossMAE). This framework employs only cross-attention in the decoder to independently read out reconstructions for a small subset of masked patches from encoder outputs. This approach achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional MAE across models ranging from ViT-S to ViT-H and significantly reduces computational requirements. By its design, CrossMAE challenges the necessity of interaction between mask tokens for effective masked pretraining. Code and models are publicly available: https://crossmae.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishubh Parihar, Abhijnya Bhat, Abhipsa Basu, Saswat Mallick, Jogendra Nath Kundu, R. Venkatesh Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have emerged as powerful generative models with unprecedented image generation capability. These models are widely used for data augmentation and creative applications. However, DMs reflect the biases present in the training datasets. This is especially concerning in the context of faces, where the DM prefers one demographic subgroup vs others (eg. female vs male). In this work, we present a method for debiasing DMs without relying on additional data or model retraining. Specifically, we propose Distribution Guidance, which enforces the generated images to follow the prescribed attribute distribution. To realize this, we build on the key insight that the latent features of denoising UNet hold rich demographic semantics, and the same can be leveraged to guide debiased generation. We train Attribute Distribution Predictor (ADP) - a small mlp that maps the latent features to the distribution of attributes. ADP is trained with pseudo labels generated from existing attribute classifiers. The proposed Distribution Guidance with ADP enables us to do fair generation. Our method reduces bias across single/multiple attributes and outperforms the baseline by a significant margin for unconditional and text-conditional diffusion models. Further, we present a downstream task of training a fair attribute classifier by rebalancing the training set with our generated data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Huang, Shuolin Xu, Hongchuan Yu, Tong-Yee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GSDeformer, a method that enables cage-based deformation on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach bridges cage-based deformation and 3DGS by using a proxy point-cloud representation. This point cloud is generated from 3D Gaussians, and deformations applied to the point cloud are translated into transformations on the 3D Gaussians. To handle potential bending caused by deformation, we incorporate a splitting process to approximate it. Our method does not modify or extend the core architecture of 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it compatible with any trained vanilla 3DGS or its variants. Additionally, we automate cage construction for 3DGS and its variants using a render-and-reconstruct approach. Experiments demonstrate that GSDeformer delivers superior deformation results compared to existing methods, is robust under extreme deformations, requires no retraining for editing, runs in real-time, and can be extended to other 3DGS variants.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubhang Bhatnagar, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model that instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Nekrasov, Rui Zhou, Miriam Ackermann, Alexander Hermans, Bastian Leibe, Matthias Rottmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe navigation of self-driving cars and robots requires a precise understanding of their environment. Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems.

<p>Abstract: We present the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. We quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, we find that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M\'elanie Roschewitz, Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro, Tian Xia, Galvin Khara, Ben Glocker</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive pretraining can substantially increase model generalisation and downstream performance. However, the quality of the learned representations is highly dependent on the data augmentation strategy applied to generate positive pairs. Positive contrastive pairs should preserve semantic meaning while discarding unwanted variations related to the data acquisition domain. Traditional contrastive pipelines attempt to simulate domain shifts through pre-defined generic image transformations. However, these do not always mimic realistic and relevant domain variations for medical imaging, such as scanner differences. To tackle this issue, we herein introduce counterfactual contrastive learning, a novel framework leveraging recent advances in causal image synthesis to create contrastive positive pairs that faithfully capture relevant domain variations. Our method, evaluated across five datasets encompassing both chest radiography and mammography data, for two established contrastive objectives (SimCLR and DINO-v2), outperforms standard contrastive learning in terms of robustness to acquisition shift. Notably, counterfactual contrastive learning achieves superior downstream performance on both in-distribution and external datasets, especially for images acquired with scanners under-represented in the training set. Further experiments show that the proposed framework extends beyond acquisition shifts, with models trained with counterfactual contrastive learning reducing subgroup disparities across biological sex.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuomin Qu, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Qian Wang, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The misuse of deep learning-based facial manipulation poses a significant threat to civil rights. To prevent this fraud at its source, proactive defense has been proposed to disrupt the manipulation process by adding invisible adversarial perturbations into images, making the forged output unconvincing to observers. However, the non-specific disruption against the output may lead to the retention of identifiable facial features, potentially resulting in the stigmatization of the individual. This paper proposes a universal framework for combating facial manipulation, termed ID-Guard. Specifically, this framework operates with a single forward pass of an encoder-decoder network to produce a cross-model transferable adversarial perturbation. A novel Identity Destruction Module (IDM) is introduced to degrade identifiable features in forged faces. We optimize the perturbation generation by framing the disruption of different facial manipulations as a multi-task learning problem, and a dynamic weight strategy is devised to enhance cross-model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ID-Guard exhibits strong efficacy in defending against various facial manipulation models, effectively degrading identifiable regions in manipulated images. It also enables disrupted images to evade facial inpainting and image recognition systems. Additionally, ID-Guard can seamlessly function as a plug-and-play component, integrating with other tasks such as adversarial training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouyan Navard, Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mengxi Zhou, Wei-Lun Chao, Alper Yilmaz, Rajiv Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image (T2I) generation, but they often struggle to balance fine-grained precision with high-level control. Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive segmentation has an important role in facilitating the annotation process of future LiDAR datasets. Existing approaches sequentially segment individual objects at each LiDAR scan, repeating the process throughout the entire sequence, which is redundant and ineffective. In this work, we propose interactive 4D segmentation, a new paradigm that allows segmenting multiple objects on multiple LiDAR scans simultaneously, and Interactive4D, the first interactive 4D segmentation model that segments multiple objects on superimposed consecutive LiDAR scans in a single iteration by utilizing the sequential nature of LiDAR data. While performing interactive segmentation, our model leverages the entire space-time volume, leading to more efficient segmentation. Operating on the 4D volume, it directly provides consistent instance IDs over time and also simplifies tracking annotations. Moreover, we show that click simulations are crucial for successful model training on LiDAR point clouds. To this end, we design a click simulation strategy that is better suited for the characteristics of LiDAR data. To demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness, we evaluate Interactive4D on multiple LiDAR datasets, where Interactive4D achieves a new state-of-the-art by a large margin.

To reduce the annotation load associated with this practice, we develop POLO, a multi-class object detection model that can be trained entirely on point labels. POLO is based on simple, yet effective modifications to the YOLOv8 architecture, including alterations to the prediction process, training losses, and post-processing. We test POLO on drone recordings of waterfowl containing up to multiple thousands of individual birds in one image and compare it to a regular YOLOv8. Our experiments show that at the same annotation cost, POLO achieves improved accuracy in counting animals in aerial imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ant Duru, Alptekin Temizel</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are tailored to specific datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We introduce two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies are selected by an LLM prior to training and iteratively refined across multiple training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where policies adapt in real-time based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before receiving LLM feedback, thereby reducing computational costs while improving performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training outcomes. Unlike traditional search-based methods, our approach leverages the contextual knowledge of LLMs, particularly in specialized domains like medical imaging, to recommend augmentation strategies tailored to domain-specific data. We evaluate our approach on multiple domain-specific image classification datasets where augmentation is key to model robustness. Results show that LLM-guided augmentation optimization outperforms traditional methods, improving model accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in automating and adapting deep learning training workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image-text matching have been notable, yet prevailing models predominantly cater to broad queries and struggle with accommodating fine-grained query intention. In this paper, we work towards the \textbf{E}ntity-centric \textbf{I}mage-\textbf{T}ext \textbf{M}atching (EITM), a task that the text and image involve specific entity-related information. The challenge of this task mainly lies in the larger semantic gap in entity association modeling, comparing with the general image-text matching problem.To narrow the huge semantic gap between the entity-centric text and the images, we take the fundamental CLIP as the backbone and devise a multimodal attentive contrastive learning framework to tam CLIP to adapt EITM problem, developing a model named EntityCLIP. The key of our multimodal attentive contrastive learning is to generate interpretive explanation text using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the bridge clues. In specific, we proceed by extracting explanatory text from off-the-shelf LLMs. This explanation text, coupled with the image and text, is then input into our specially crafted Multimodal Attentive Experts (MMAE) module, which effectively integrates explanation texts to narrow the gap of the entity-related text and image in a shared semantic space. Building on the enriched features derived from MMAE, we further design an effective Gated Integrative Image-text Matching (GI-ITM) strategy. The GI-ITM employs an adaptive gating mechanism to aggregate MMAE's features, subsequently applying image-text matching constraints to steer the alignment between the text and the image. Extensive experiments are conducted on three social media news benchmarks including N24News, VisualNews, and GoodNews, the results shows that our method surpasses the competition methods with a clear margin.</p>

Addressing this gap, we introduce MapDR, a novel dataset designed for the extraction of Driving Rules from traffic signs and their association with vectorized, locally perceived HD Maps. MapDR features over $10,000$ annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushi Lan, Shangchen Zhou, Zhaoyang Lyu, Fangzhou Hong, Shuai Yang, Bo Dai, Xingang Pan, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: While 3D content generation has advanced significantly, existing methods still face challenges with input formats, latent space design, and output representations. This paper introduces a novel 3D generation framework that addresses these challenges, offering scalable, high-quality 3D generation with an interactive Point Cloud-structured Latent space. Our framework employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with multi-view posed RGB-D(epth)-N(ormal) renderings as input, using a unique latent space design that preserves 3D shape information, and incorporates a cascaded latent flow-based model for improved shape-texture disentanglement. The proposed method, GaussianAnything, supports multi-modal conditional 3D generation, allowing for point cloud, caption, and single image inputs. Notably, the newly proposed latent space naturally enables geometry-texture disentanglement, thus allowing 3D-aware editing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple datasets, outperforming existing native 3D methods in both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagnik Majumder, Tushar Nagarajan, Ziad Al-Halah, Reina Pradhan, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a multi-view video, which viewpoint is most informative for a human observer? Existing methods rely on heuristics or expensive "best-view" supervision to answer this question, limiting their applicability. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put this into action, we propose LangView, a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector, together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view video--no language or camera poses--and returns the best viewpoint to watch at each timestep. On two challenging datasets comprised of diverse multi-camera setups and how-to activities, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both with quantitative metrics and human evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bencheng Liao, Shaoyu Chen, Haoran Yin, Bo Jiang, Cheng Wang, Sixu Yan, Xinbang Zhang, Xiangyu Li, Ying Zhang, Qian Zhang, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Fazli Imam, Rufael Fedaku Marew, Jameel Hassan, Mustansar Fiaz, Alham Fikri Aji, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text & visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Tran, Thang Pham, Winston Bounsavy, Tri Nguyen, Ngan Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling occlusion remains a significant challenge for video instance-level tasks like Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Applying style transfer to a full 3D environment is a challenging task that has seen many developments since the advent of neural rendering. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently pushed further many limits of neural rendering in terms of training speed and reconstruction quality. This work introduces SGSST: Scaling Gaussian Splatting Style Transfer, an optimization-based method to apply style transfer to pretrained 3DGS scenes. We demonstrate that a new multiscale loss based on global neural statistics, that we name SOS for Simultaneously Optimized Scales, enables style transfer to ultra-high resolution 3D scenes. Not only SGSST pioneers 3D scene style transfer at such high image resolutions, it also produces superior visual quality as assessed by thorough qualitative, quantitative and perceptual comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Dan Guo, Guoliang Chen, Chunxiao Fan, Jingyuan Xu, Zhiliang Wu, Hehe Fan, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (PCAN) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. Firstly, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. Secondly, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative (FN) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive (FP) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. Finally, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyu Wu, Xianglin Qiu, Siqi Song, Zhenhong Chen, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haicheng Wang, Zhemeng Yu, Gabriele Spadaro, Chen Ju, Victor Qu\'etu, Shuai Xiao, Enzo Tartaglione</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable effectiveness for multi-modal tasks due to their abilities to generate and understand cross-modal data. However, processing long sequences of visual tokens extracted from visual backbones poses a challenge for deployment in real-time applications. To address this issue, we introduce FOLDER, a simple yet effective plug-and-play module designed to reduce the length of the visual token sequence, mitigating both computational and memory demands during training and inference. Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction process, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction strategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual redundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the visual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference phase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even performance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or even better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing complexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity, requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error, emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the "Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease, bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate treatments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuling Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a core task in computer vision that enables spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. Deep learning methods typically estimate relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale often leads to geometric inconsistencies. This limitation severely impacts applications such as visual SLAM, detailed 3D modeling, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) addresses this issue by producing depth maps with absolute scale, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency and supporting direct deployment without scale calibration. This paper presents a structured survey of depth estimation methods, tracing the evolution from traditional geometry-based approaches to modern deep learning models. Recent progress in MMDE is analyzed, with a focus on two key challenges: poor generalization and blurred object boundaries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored various strategies, including self-supervised learning with unlabeled data, patch-based training, architectural enhancements, and generative model integration. Each method is discussed in terms of technical contribution, performance improvement, and remaining limitations. The survey consolidates recent findings, identifies unresolved challenges, and outlines future directions for MMDE. By highlighting key advancements and open problems, this paper aims to support the continued development and real-world adoption of metric depth estimation in computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyeob Baek, Yi-Fu Wu, Gautam Singh, Sungjin Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have an innate ability to decompose their perceptions of the world into objects and their attributes, such as colors, shapes, and movement patterns. This cognitive process enables us to imagine novel futures by recombining familiar concepts. However, replicating this ability in artificial intelligence systems has proven challenging, particularly when it comes to modeling videos into compositional concepts and generating unseen, recomposed futures without relying on auxiliary data, such as text, masks, or bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Dreamweaver, a neural architecture designed to discover hierarchical and compositional representations from raw videos and generate compositional future simulations. Our approach leverages a novel Recurrent Block-Slot Unit (RBSU) to decompose videos into their constituent objects and attributes. In addition, Dreamweaver uses a multi-future-frame prediction objective to capture disentangled representations for dynamic concepts more effectively as well as static concepts. In experiments, we demonstrate our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for world modeling when evaluated under the DCI framework across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we show how the modularized concept representations of our model enable compositional imagination, allowing the generation of novel videos by recombining attributes from previously seen objects. cun-bjy.github.io/dreamweaver-website</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion-based talking face generation models have demonstrated impressive potential in synthesizing videos that accurately match a speech audio clip with a given reference identity. However, existing approaches still encounter significant challenges due to uncontrollable factors, such as inaccurate lip-sync, inappropriate head posture and the lack of fine-grained control over facial expressions. In order to introduce more face-guided conditions beyond speech audio clips, a novel two-stage training framework Playmate is proposed to generate more lifelike facial expressions and talking faces. In the first stage, we introduce a decoupled implicit 3D representation along with a meticulously designed motion-decoupled module to facilitate more accurate attribute disentanglement and generate expressive talking videos directly from audio cues. Then, in the second stage, we introduce an emotion-control module to encode emotion control information into the latent space, enabling fine-grained control over emotions and thereby achieving the ability to generate talking videos with desired emotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Playmate outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality and lip-synchronization, and improves flexibility in controlling emotion and head pose.

<p>Abstract: The continuous development of foundational models for video generation is evolving into various applications, with subject-consistent video generation still in the exploratory stage. We refer to this as Subject-to-Video, which extracts subject elements from reference images and generates subject-consistent videos following textual instructions. We believe that the essence of subject-to-video lies in balancing the dual-modal prompts of text and image, thereby deeply and simultaneously aligning both text and visual content. To this end, we propose Phantom, a unified video generation framework for both single- and multi-subject references. Building on existing text-to-video and image-to-video architectures, we redesign the joint text-image injection model and drive it to learn cross-modal alignment via text-image-video triplet data. The proposed method achieves high-fidelity subject-consistent video generation while addressing issues of image content leakage and multi-subject confusion. Evaluation results indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. In particular, we emphasize subject consistency in human generation, covering existing ID-preserving video generation while offering enhanced advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, Soudeep Shahriar, M. F. Mridha, Md. Jakir Hossen, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a unified framework for the unsupervised prediction of physically plausible interpolations between two 3D articulated shapes and the automatic estimation of dense correspondence between them. Interpolation is modelled as a diffeomorphic transformation using a smooth, time-varying flow field governed by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). This ensures topological consistency and non-intersecting trajectories while accommodating hard constraints, such as volume preservation, and soft constraints, \eg physical priors.
  Correspondence is recovered using an efficient Varifold formulation, that is effective on high-fidelity surfaces with differing parameterisations. By providing a simple skeleton for the source shape only, we impose physically motivated constraints on the deformation field and resolve symmetric ambiguities. This is achieved without relying on skinning weights or any prior knowledge of the skeleton's target pose configuration.
  Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate competitive or superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches in both shape correspondence and interpolation tasks across standard datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Basudha Pal, Siyuan Huang, Rama Chellappa</p>
<p>Abstract: Person Re-identification (ReID) systems identify individuals across images or video frames and play a critical role in various real-world applications. However, many ReID methods are influenced by sensitive attributes such as gender, pose, and body mass index (BMI), which vary in uncontrolled environments, leading to biases and reduced generalization. To address this, we extend the concept of expressivity to the body recognition domain to better understand how ReID models encode these attributes. Expressivity, defined as the mutual information between feature vector representations and specific attributes, is computed using a secondary neural network that takes feature and attribute vectors as inputs. This provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the extent to which sensitive attributes are embedded in the model's representations. We apply expressivity analysis to SemReID, a state-of-the-art self-supervised ReID model, and find that BMI consistently exhibits the highest expressivity scores in the model's final layers, underscoring its dominant role in feature encoding. In the final attention layer of the trained network, the expressivity order for body attributes is BMI > Pitch > Yaw > Gender, highlighting their relative importance in learned representations. Additionally, expressivity values evolve progressively across network layers and training epochs, reflecting a dynamic encoding of attributes during feature extraction. These insights emphasize the influence of body-related attributes on ReID models and provide a systematic methodology for identifying and mitigating attribute-driven biases. By leveraging expressivity analysis, we offer valuable tools to enhance the fairness, robustness, and generalization of ReID systems in diverse real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shining Wang, Yunlong Wang, Ruiqi Wu, Bingliang Jiao, Wenxuan Wang, Peng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: When discussing the Aerial-Ground Person Re-identification (AGPReID) task, we face the main challenge of the significant appearance variations caused by different viewpoints, making identity matching difficult. To address this issue, previous methods attempt to reduce the differences between viewpoints by critical attributes and decoupling the viewpoints. While these methods can mitigate viewpoint differences to some extent, they still face two main issues: (1) difficulty in handling viewpoint diversity and (2) neglect of the contribution of local features. To effectively address these challenges, we design and implement the Self-Calibrating and Adaptive Prompt (SeCap) method for the AGPReID task. The core of this framework relies on the Prompt Re-calibration Module (PRM), which adaptively re-calibrates prompts based on the input. Combined with the Local Feature Refinement Module (LFRM), SeCap can extract view-invariant features from local features for AGPReID. Meanwhile, given the current scarcity of datasets in the AGPReID field, we further contribute two real-world Large-scale Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification datasets, LAGPeR and G2APS-ReID. The former is collected and annotated by us independently, covering $4,231$ unique identities and containing $63,841$ high-quality images; the latter is reconstructed from the person search dataset G2APS. Through extensive experiments on AGPReID datasets, we demonstrate that SeCap is a feasible and effective solution for the AGPReID task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justus Karlsson, Yonghao Xu, Amanda Berg, Leif Haglund</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple studies have performed next-day fire prediction using satellite imagery. Two main satellites are used to detect wildfires: MODIS and VIIRS. Both satellites provide fire mask products, called MOD14 and VNP14, respectively. Studies have used one or the other, but there has been no comparison between them to determine which might be more suitable for next-day fire prediction. In this paper, we first evaluate how well VIIRS and MODIS data can be used to forecast wildfire spread one day ahead. We find that the model using VIIRS as input and VNP14 as target achieves the best results. Interestingly, the model using MODIS as input and VNP14 as target performs significantly better than using VNP14 as input and MOD14 as target. Next, we discuss why MOD14 might be harder to use for predicting next-day fires. We find that the MOD14 fire mask is highly stochastic and does not correlate with reasonable fire spread patterns. This is detrimental for machine learning tasks, as the model learns irrational patterns. Therefore, we conclude that MOD14 is unsuitable for next-day fire prediction and that VNP14 is a much better option. However, using MODIS input and VNP14 as target, we achieve a significant improvement in predictability. This indicates that an improved fire detection model is possible for MODIS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zecheng Zhao, Zhi Chen, Zi Huang, Shazia Sadiq, Tong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to retrieve relevant videos based on textual queries. However, as video content evolves continuously, adapting TVR systems to new data remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to address the limitations of existing approaches. Current Pre-Trained Model (PTM)-based TVR methods struggle with maintaining model plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing Continual Learning (CL) methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these two challenges, we propose FrameFusionMoE, a novel CTVR framework that comprises two key components: (1) the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal video dynamics while preserving model plasticity, and (2) the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which ensures consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Thus, FrameFusionMoE enables effective adaptation to new video content while preserving historical text-video relevance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We comprehensively evaluate FrameFusionMoE on two benchmark datasets under various task settings. Results demonstrate that FrameFusionMoE outperforms existing CL and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks when handling continuous video streams.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyue Guo, Jiarui Hu, Junjie Hu, Hujun Bao, Guofeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, camera-based solutions have been extensively explored for scene semantic completion (SSC). Despite their success in visible areas, existing methods struggle to capture complete scene semantics due to frequent visual occlusions. To address this limitation, this paper presents the first satellite-ground cooperative SSC framework, i.e., SGFormer, exploring the potential of satellite-ground image pairs in the SSC task. Specifically, we propose a dual-branch architecture that encodes orthogonal satellite and ground views in parallel, unifying them into a common domain. Additionally, we design a ground-view guidance strategy that corrects satellite image biases during feature encoding, addressing misalignment between satellite and ground views. Moreover, we develop an adaptive weighting strategy that balances contributions from satellite and ground views. Experiments demonstrate that SGFormer outperforms the state of the art on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Our code is available on https://github.com/gxytcrc/SGFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenfei Liao, Kaiyu Lei, Xu Zheng, Junha Moon, Zhixiong Wang, Yixuan Wang, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool, Xuming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) addresses the limitations of single-modality data by integrating complementary information across modalities. Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field.

<p>Abstract: Understanding the representation shift on Vision Language Models like CLIP under different augmentations provides valuable insights on Mechanistic Interpretability. In this study, we show the shift on CLIP's embeddings on 9 common augmentation techniques: noise, blur, color jitter, scale and rotate, flip, elastic and perspective transforms, random brightness and contrast, and coarse dropout of pixel blocks. We scrutinize the embedding shifts under similarity on attention map, patch, edge, detail preservation, cosine similarity, L2 distance, pairwise distance and dendrogram clusters and provide qualitative analysis on sample images. Our findings suggest certain augmentations like noise, perspective transform and shift scaling have higher degree of drastic impact on embedding shift. This study provides a concrete foundation for future work on VLM's robustness for mechanical interpretation and adversarial data defense.

<p>Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkai Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou, Yue Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) answers clinical questions using medical images, aiding diagnosis. Designing the MedVQA system holds profound importance in assisting clinical diagnosis and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Building upon this foundation, Hierarchical Medical VQA extends Medical VQA by organizing medical questions into a hierarchical structure and making level-specific predictions to handle fine-grained distinctions. Recently, many studies have proposed hierarchical MedVQA tasks and established datasets, However, several issues still remain: (1) imperfect hierarchical modeling leads to poor differentiation between question levels causing semantic fragmentation across hierarchies. (2) Excessive reliance on implicit learning in Transformer-based cross-modal self-attention fusion methods, which obscures crucial local semantic correlations in medical scenarios. To address these issues, this study proposes a HiCA-VQA method, including two modules: Hierarchical Prompting for fine-grained medical questions and Hierarchical Answer Decoders. The hierarchical prompting module pre-aligns hierarchical text prompts with image features to guide the model in focusing on specific image regions according to question types, while the hierarchical decoder performs separate predictions for questions at different levels to improve accuracy across granularities. The framework also incorporates a cross-attention fusion module where images serve as queries and text as key-value pairs. Experiments on the Rad-Restruct benchmark demonstrate that the HiCA-VQA framework better outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in answering hierarchical fine-grained questions. This study provides an effective pathway for hierarchical visual question answering systems, advancing medical image understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dahun Kim, AJ Piergiovanni, Ganesh Mallya, Anelia Angelova</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce VideoComp, a benchmark and learning framework for advancing video-text compositionality understanding, aimed at improving vision-language models (VLMs) in fine-grained temporal alignment. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos, our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing model capabilities in achieving fine-grained, temporally coherent video-text alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Chen, Jiacheng Wei, Tianrun Chen, Chi Zhang, Xiaofeng Yang, Shangzhan Zhang, Bingchen Yang, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Guosheng Lin, Qixing Huang, Fayao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating CAD digital twins from the physical world is crucial for manufacturing, design, and simulation. However, current methods typically rely on costly 3D scanning with labor-intensive post-processing. To provide a user-friendly design process, we explore the problem of reverse engineering from unconstrained real-world CAD images that can be easily captured by users of all experiences. However, the scarcity of real-world CAD data poses challenges in directly training such models. To tackle these challenges, we propose CADCrafter, an image-to-parametric CAD model generation framework that trains solely on synthetic textureless CAD data while testing on real-world images. To bridge the significant representation disparity between images and parametric CAD models, we introduce a geometry encoder to accurately capture diverse geometric features. Moreover, the texture-invariant properties of the geometric features can also facilitate the generalization to real-world scenarios. Since compiling CAD parameter sequences into explicit CAD models is a non-differentiable process, the network training inherently lacks explicit geometric supervision. To impose geometric validity constraints, we employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to fine-tune our model with the automatic code checker feedback on CAD sequence quality. Furthermore, we collected a real-world dataset, comprised of multi-view images and corresponding CAD command sequence pairs, to evaluate our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can robustly handle real unconstrained CAD images, and even generalize to unseen general objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Affine correspondences have received significant attention due to their benefits in tasks like image matching and pose estimation. Existing methods for extracting affine correspondences still have many limitations in terms of performance; thus, exploring a new paradigm is crucial. In this paper, we present a new pipeline designed for extracting accurate affine correspondences by integrating dense matching and geometric constraints. Specifically, a novel extraction framework is introduced, with the aid of dense matching and a novel keypoint scale and orientation estimator. For this purpose, we propose loss functions based on geometric constraints, which can effectively improve accuracy by supervising neural networks to learn feature geometry. The experimental show that the accuracy and robustness of our method outperform the existing ones in image matching tasks. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to relative pose estimation. Affine correspondences extracted by our method lead to more accurate poses than the baselines on a range of real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/stilcrad/DenseAffine.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safety constitutes a foundational imperative for autonomous driving systems, necessitating the maximal incorporation of accessible external prior information. This study establishes that temporal perception buffers and cost-efficient maps inherently form complementary prior sources for online vectorized high-definition (HD) map construction. We present Uni-PrevPredMap, a unified prior-informed framework that systematically integrates two synergistic information sources: previous predictions and simulated outdated HD maps. The framework introduces two core innovations: a tile-indexed 3D vectorized global map processor enabling efficient refreshment, storage, and retrieval of 3D vectorized priors; a tri-mode operational optimization paradigm ensuring consistency across non-prior, temporal-prior, and temporal-map-fusion-prior scenarios while mitigating reliance on idealized map fidelity assumptions. Uni-PrevPredMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in map-absent scenarios across established online vectorized HD map construction benchmarks. When provided with simulated outdated HD maps, the framework exhibits robust capabilities in error-resilient prior fusion, empirically confirming the synergistic complementarity between previous predictions and simulated outdated HD maps.

<p>Abstract: Landmark detection plays a crucial role in medical imaging tasks that rely on precise spatial localization, including specific applications in diagnosis, treatment planning, image registration, and surgical navigation. However, manual annotation is labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge. While deep learning shows promise in automating this task, progress is hindered by limited public datasets, inconsistent benchmarks, and non-standardized baselines, restricting reproducibility, fair comparisons, and model generalizability. This work introduces nnLandmark, a self-configuring deep learning framework for 3D medical landmark detection, adapting nnU-Net to perform heatmap-based regression. By leveraging nnU-Net's automated configuration, nnLandmark eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, offering out-of-the-box usability. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across two public datasets, with a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.5 mm on the Mandibular Molar Landmark (MML) dental CT dataset and 1.2 mm for anatomical fiducials on a brain MRI dataset (AFIDs), where nnLandmark aligns with the inter-rater variability of 1.5 mm. With its strong generalization, reproducibility, and ease of deployment, nnLandmark establishes a reliable baseline for 3D landmark detection, supporting research in anatomical localization and clinical workflows that depend on precise landmark identification. The code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishubh Parihar, Vaibhav Agrawal, Sachidanand VS, R. Venkatesh Babu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches for controlling text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, do not allow for explicit 3D object-centric control, such as precise control of object orientation. In this work, we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware \textbf{compass} tokens, one for each object, along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets on a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor orientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate this, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects, indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with personalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art orientation control and text alignment, quantified with extensive evaluations and a user study.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current monocular 3D detectors are held back by the limited diversity and scale of real-world datasets. While data augmentation certainly helps, it's particularly difficult to generate realistic scene-aware augmented data for outdoor settings. Most current approaches to synthetic data generation focus on realistic object appearance through improved rendering techniques. However, we show that where and how objects are positioned is just as crucial for training effective 3D monocular detectors. The key obstacle lies in automatically determining realistic object placement parameters - including position, dimensions, and directional alignment when introducing synthetic objects into actual scenes. To address this, we introduce MonoPlace3D, a novel system that considers the 3D scene content to create realistic augmentations. Specifically, given a background scene, MonoPlace3D learns a distribution over plausible 3D bounding boxes. Subsequently, we render realistic objects and place them according to the locations sampled from the learned distribution. Our comprehensive evaluation on two standard datasets KITTI and NuScenes, demonstrates that MonoPlace3D significantly improves the accuracy of multiple existing monocular 3D detectors while being highly data efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p>

However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\'as Gaggion, Benjamin A. Matheson, Yan Xia, Rodrigo Bonazzola, Nishant Ravikumar, Zeike A. Taylor, Diego H. Milone, Alejandro F. Frangi, Enzo Ferrante</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging is emerging as a crucial tool to examine cardiac morphology and function. Essential to this endeavour are anatomical 3D surface and volumetric meshes derived from CMR images, which facilitate computational anatomy studies, biomarker discovery, and in-silico simulations. Traditional approaches typically follow complex multi-step pipelines, first segmenting images and then reconstructing meshes, making them time-consuming and prone to error propagation. In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multi-view HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank confirm the potential of HybridVNet to significantly advance cardiac imaging and computational cardiology by efficiently generating high-fidelity meshes from CMR images. Multi-view HybridVNet outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements of up to $\sim$27\% reduction in Mean Contour Distance (from 1.86 mm to 1.35 mm for the LV Myocardium), up to $\sim$18\% improvement in Hausdorff distance (from 4.74 mm to 3.89mm, for the LV Endocardium), and up to $\sim$8\% in Dice Coefficient (from 0.78 to 0.84, for the LV Myocardium), highlighting its superior accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anish Acharya, Li Jing, Bhargav Bhushanam, Dhruv Choudhary, Michael Rabbat, Sujay Sanghavi, Inderjit S Dhillon</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretext Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has become a standard paradigm for learning with limited labels. We extend this approach to the Positive Unlabeled (PU) setting, where only a small set of labeled positives and a large unlabeled pool -- containing both positives and negatives are available. We study this problem under two regimes: (i) without access to the class prior, and (ii) when the prior is known or can be estimated. We introduce Positive Unlabeled Contrastive Learning (puCL), an unbiased and variance reducing contrastive objective that integrates weak supervision from labeled positives judiciously into the contrastive loss. When the class prior is known, we propose Positive Unlabeled InfoNCE (puNCE), a prior-aware extension that re-weights unlabeled samples as soft positive negative mixtures. For downstream classification, we develop a pseudo-labeling algorithm that leverages the structure of the learned embedding space via PU aware clustering. Our framework is supported by theory; offering bias-variance analysis, convergence insights, and generalization guarantees via augmentation concentration; and validated empirically across standard PU benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-supervision regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berthy T. Feng, Ricardo Baptista, Katherine L. Bouman</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating visually-convincing images, but they often struggle to meet subtle constraints inherent in the training data. Such constraints could be physics-based (e.g., satisfying a PDE), geometric (e.g., respecting symmetry), or semantic (e.g., including a particular number of objects). When the training data all satisfy a certain constraint, enforcing this constraint on a diffusion model makes it more reliable for generating valid synthetic data and solving constrained inverse problems. However, existing methods for constrained diffusion models are restricted in the constraints they can handle. For instance, recent work proposed to learn mirror diffusion models (MDMs), but analytical mirror maps only exist for convex constraints and can be challenging to derive. We propose neural approximate mirror maps (NAMMs) for general, possibly non-convex constraints. Our approach only requires a differentiable distance function from the constraint set. We learn an approximate mirror map that transforms data into an unconstrained space and a corresponding approximate inverse that maps data back to the constraint set. A generative model, such as an MDM, can then be trained in the learned mirror space and its samples restored to the constraint set by the inverse map. We validate our approach on a variety of constraints, showing that compared to an unconstrained diffusion model, a NAMM-based MDM substantially improves constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate how existing diffusion-based inverse-problem solvers can be easily applied in the learned mirror space to solve constrained inverse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moayed Haji-Ali, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Guha Balakrishnan, Sergey Tulyakov, Vicente Ordonez</p>
<p>Abstract: The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Robert, Alexia Calovoulos, Laurent Facq, Fanny Decoeur, Etienne Gontier, Christophe F. Grosset, Baudouin Denis de Senneville</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately segmenting and individualizing cells in SEM images is a highly promising technique for elucidating tissue architecture in oncology. While current AI-based methods are effective, errors persist, necessitating time-consuming manual corrections, particularly in areas where the quality of cell contours in the image is poor and requires gap filling. This study presents a novel AI-driven approach for refining cell boundary delineation to improve instance-based cell segmentation in SEM images, also reducing the necessity for residual manual correction. A CNN COp-Net is introduced to address gaps in cell contours, effectively filling in regions with deficient or absent information. The network takes as input cell contour probability maps with potentially inadequate or missing information and outputs corrected cell contour delineations. The lack of training data was addressed by generating low integrity probability maps using a tailored PDE. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in augmenting cell boundary precision using both private SEM images from PDX hepatoblastoma tissues and publicly accessible images datasets. The proposed cell contour closing operator exhibits a notable improvement in tested datasets, achieving respectively close to 50% (private data) and 10% (public data) increase in the accurately-delineated cell proportion compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the need for manual corrections was significantly reduced, therefore facilitating the overall digitalization process. Our results demonstrate a notable enhancement in the accuracy of cell instance segmentation, particularly in highly challenging regions where image quality compromises the integrity of cell boundaries, necessitating gap filling. Therefore, our work should ultimately facilitate the study of tumour tissue bioarchitecture in onconanotomy field.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06264">Think While You Generate: Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sulin Liu, Juno Nam, Andrew Campbell, Hannes St\"ark, Yilun Xu, Tommi Jaakkola, Rafael G\'omez-Bombarelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based image generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Li, Mathias Funk, Jindong Wang, Aaqib Saeed</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) has emerged as a promising framework to leverage large quantities of unlabeled data across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, real-world deployments remain limited by high annotation costs and communication-intensive sampling processes, particularly in a cross-silo setting, when clients possess substantial local datasets. This paper addresses the crucial question: What is the best practice to reduce communication costs in human-in-the-loop learning with minimal annotator effort? Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling. Extensive experiments on diverse medical and natural image benchmarks demonstrate that FAST outperforms existing FAL methods by an average of 4.36% while reducing communication rounds eightfold under a limited 5% labeling budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Jenadeleh, Jon Sneyers, Panqi Jia, Shima Mohammadi, Joao Ascenso, Dietmar Saupe</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based image compression methods have recently emerged as promising alternatives to traditional codecs, offering improved rate-distortion performance and perceptual quality. JPEG AI represents the latest standardized framework in this domain, leveraging deep neural networks for high-fidelity image reconstruction. In this study, we present a comprehensive subjective visual quality assessment of JPEG AI-compressed images using the JPEG AIC-3 methodology, which quantifies perceptual differences in terms of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) units. We generated a dataset of 50 compressed images with fine-grained distortion levels from five diverse sources. A large-scale crowdsourced experiment collected 96,200 triplet responses from 459 participants. We reconstructed JND-based quality scales using a unified model based on boosted and plain triplet comparisons. Additionally, we evaluated the alignment of multiple objective image quality metrics with human perception in the high-fidelity range. The CVVDP metric achieved the overall highest performance; however, most metrics including CVVDP were overly optimistic in predicting the quality of JPEG AI-compressed images. These findings emphasize the necessity for rigorous subjective evaluations in the development and benchmarking of modern image codecs, particularly in the high-fidelity range. Another technical contribution is the introduction of the well-known Meng-Rosenthal-Rubin statistical test to the field of Quality of Experience research. This test can reliably assess the significance of difference in performance of quality metrics in terms of correlation between metrics and ground truth. The complete dataset, including all subjective scores, is publicly available at https://github.com/jpeg-aic/dataset-JPEG-AI-SDR25.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06385">Fast Globally Optimal and Geometrically Consistent 3D Shape Matching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Roetzer, Florian Bernard</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometric consistency, i.e. the preservation of neighbourhoods, is a natural and strong prior in 3D shape matching. Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic paths, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06553">ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Chang, Leonor Fermoselle, Duy Ta, Bernadette Bucher, Luca Carlone, Jiuguang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p>
