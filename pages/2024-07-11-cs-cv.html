<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of diffusion models (DMs) has significantly advanced image and video applications, making "what you want is what you see" a reality. Among these, video editing has gained substantial attention and seen a swift rise in research activity, necessitating a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature. This paper reviews diffusion model-based video editing techniques, including theoretical foundations and practical applications. We begin by overviewing the mathematical formulation and image domain's key methods. Subsequently, we categorize video editing approaches by the inherent connections of their core technologies, depicting evolutionary trajectory. This paper also dives into novel applications, including point-based editing and pose-guided human video editing. Additionally, we present a comprehensive comparison using our newly introduced V2VBench. Building on the progress achieved to date, the paper concludes with ongoing challenges and potential directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyuan Liu, Yuanhong Chen, Hu Wang, Vasileios Belagiannis, Ian Reid, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The costly and time-consuming annotation process to produce large training sets for modelling semantic LiDAR segmentation methods has motivated the development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, such SSL approaches often concentrate on employing consistency learning only for individual LiDAR representations. This narrow focus results in limited perturbations that generally fail to enable effective consistency learning. Additionally, these SSL approaches employ contrastive learning based on the sampling from a limited set of positive and negative embedding samples. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation framework called ItTakesTwo (IT2). IT2 is designed to ensure consistent predictions from peer LiDAR representations, thereby improving the perturbation effectiveness in consistency learning. Furthermore, our contrastive learning employs informative samples drawn from a distribution of positive and negative embeddings learned from the entire training set. Results on public benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoding Yuan, Shitao Tang, Kejie Li, Alan Yuille, Peng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Camera-free Diffusion (CamFreeDiff) model for 360-degree image outpainting from a single camera-free image and text description. This method distinguishes itself from existing strategies, such as MVDiffusion, by eliminating the requirement for predefined camera poses. Instead, our model incorporates a mechanism for predicting homography directly within the multi-view diffusion framework. The core of our approach is to formulate camera estimation by predicting the homography transformation from the input view to a predefined canonical view. The homography provides point-level correspondences between the input image and targeting panoramic images, allowing connections enforced by correspondence-aware attention in a fully differentiable manner. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate our model's strong robustness and generalization ability for 360-degree image outpainting in the challenging context of camera-free inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jooyeol Yun, Jaegul Choo</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of personalized image aesthetic assessment seeks to tailor aesthetic score prediction models to match individual preferences with just a few user-provided inputs. However, the scalability and generalization capabilities of current approaches are considerably restricted by their reliance on an expensive curated database. To overcome this long-standing scalability challenge, we present a unique approach that leverages readily available databases for general image aesthetic assessment and image quality assessment. Specifically, we view each database as a distinct image score regression task that exhibits varying degrees of personalization potential. By determining optimal combinations of task vectors, known to represent specific traits of each database, we successfully create personalized models for individuals. This approach of integrating multiple models allows us to harness a substantial amount of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generalizing to previously unseen domains-a challenge previous approaches have struggled to achieve-making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios. Our novel approach significantly advances the field by offering scalable solutions for personalized aesthetic assessment and establishing high standards for future research. https://yeolj00.github.io/personal-projects/personalized-aesthetics/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourav Agrawal, Isaac Corley, Conor Wallace, Clovis Vaughn, Jonathan Lwowski</p>
<p>Abstract: The production of wind energy is a crucial part of sustainable development and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. Maintaining the integrity of wind turbines to produce this energy is a costly and time-consuming task requiring repeated inspection and maintenance. While autonomous drones have proven to make this process more efficient, the algorithms for detecting anomalies to prevent catastrophic damage to turbine blades have fallen behind due to some dangerous defects, such as hairline cracks, being barely-visible. Existing datasets and literature are lacking and tend towards detecting obvious and visible defects in addition to not being geographically diverse. In this paper we introduce a novel and diverse dataset of barely-visible hairline cracks collected from numerous wind turbine inspections. To prove the efficacy of our dataset, we detail our end-to-end deployed turbine crack detection pipeline from the image acquisition stage to the use of predictions in providing automated maintenance recommendations to extend the life and efficiency of wind turbines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Atif Butt, Kai Wang, Javier Vazquez-Corral, Joost van de Weijer</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with the advent of diffusion models. These models exhibit remarkable abilities to produce images based on textual prompts. Current T2I models allow users to specify object colors using linguistic color names. However, these labels encompass broad color ranges, making it difficult to achieve precise color matching. To tackle this challenging task, named color prompt learning, we propose to learn specific color prompts tailored to user-selected colors. Existing T2I personalization methods tend to result in color-shape entanglement. To overcome this, we generate several basic geometric objects in the target color, allowing for color and shape disentanglement during the color prompt learning. Our method, denoted as ColorPeel, successfully assists the T2I models to peel off the novel color prompts from these colored shapes. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ColorPeel in achieving precise color generation with T2I models. Furthermore, we generalize ColorPeel to effectively learn abstract attribute concepts, including textures, materials, etc. Our findings represent a significant step towards improving precision and versatility of T2I models, offering new opportunities for creative applications and design tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Mei, Jiacong Xu, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Referenced-based scene stylization that edits the appearance based on a content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness, they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07221">Tracing Back the Malicious Clients in Poisoning Attacks to Federated Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Jia, Minghong Fang, Hongbin Liu, Jinghuai Zhang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Poisoning attacks compromise the training phase of federated learning (FL) such that the learned global model misclassifies attacker-chosen inputs called target inputs. Existing defenses mainly focus on protecting the training phase of FL such that the learnt global model is poison free. However, these defenses often achieve limited effectiveness when the clients' local training data is highly non-iid or the number of malicious clients is large, as confirmed in our experiments. In this work, we propose FLForensics, the first poison-forensics method for FL. FLForensics complements existing training-phase defenses. In particular, when training-phase defenses fail and a poisoned global model is deployed, FLForensics aims to trace back the malicious clients that performed the poisoning attack after a misclassified target input is identified. We theoretically show that FLForensics can accurately distinguish between benign and malicious clients under a formal definition of poisoning attack. Moreover, we empirically show the effectiveness of FLForensics at tracing back both existing and adaptive poisoning attacks on five benchmark datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07249">Few-Shot Image Generation by Conditional Relaxing Diffusion Inversion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Cao, Shaogang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of Few-Shot Image Generation (FSIG) using Deep Generative Models (DGMs), accurately estimating the distribution of target domain with minimal samples poses a significant challenge. This requires a method that can both capture the broad diversity and the true characteristics of the target domain distribution. We present Conditional Relaxing Diffusion Inversion (CRDI), an innovative `training-free' approach designed to enhance distribution diversity in synthetic image generation. Distinct from conventional methods, CRDI does not rely on fine-tuning based on only a few samples. Instead, it focuses on reconstructing each target image instance and expanding diversity through few-shot learning. The approach initiates by identifying a Sample-wise Guidance Embedding (SGE) for the diffusion model, which serves a purpose analogous to the explicit latent codes in certain Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models. Subsequently, the method involves a scheduler that progressively introduces perturbations to the SGE, thereby augmenting diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrates that our method surpasses GAN-based reconstruction techniques and equals state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSIG methods in performance. Additionally, it effectively mitigates overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, common drawbacks of fine-tuning approaches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07268">Dataset Quantization with Active Learning based Adaptive Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Zhao, Yuzhang Shang, Junyi Wu, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has made remarkable progress recently, largely due to the availability of large, well-labeled datasets. However, the training on such datasets elevates costs and computational demands. To address this, various techniques like coreset selection, dataset distillation, and dataset quantization have been explored in the literature. Unlike traditional techniques that depend on uniform sample distributions across different classes, our research demonstrates that maintaining performance is feasible even with uneven distributions. We find that for certain classes, the variation in sample quantity has a minimal impact on performance. Inspired by this observation, an intuitive idea is to reduce the number of samples for stable classes and increase the number of samples for sensitive classes to achieve a better performance with the same sampling ratio. Then the question arises: how can we adaptively select samples from a dataset to achieve optimal performance? In this paper, we propose a novel active learning based adaptive sampling strategy, Dataset Quantization with Active Learning based Adaptive Sampling (DQAS), to optimize the sample selection. In addition, we introduce a novel pipeline for dataset quantization, utilizing feature space from the final stage of dataset quantization to generate more precise dataset bins. Our comprehensive evaluations on the multiple datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art dataset compression methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07276">Exploring Camera Encoder Designs for Autonomous Driving Perception</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Barath Lakshmanan, Joshua Chen, Shiyi Lan, Maying Shen, Zhiding Yu, Jose M. Alvarez</p>
<p>Abstract: The cornerstone of autonomous vehicles (AV) is a solid perception system, where camera encoders play a crucial role. Existing works usually leverage pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) designed for general vision tasks, such as image classification, segmentation, and 2D detection. Although those well-known architectures have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in AV-related tasks, e.g., 3D Object Detection, there remains significant potential for improvement in network design due to the nuanced complexities of industrial-level AV dataset. Moreover, existing public AV benchmarks usually contain insufficient data, which might lead to inaccurate evaluation of those architectures.To reveal the AV-specific model insights, we start from a standard general-purpose encoder, ConvNeXt and progressively transform the design. We adjust different design parameters including width and depth of the model, stage compute ratio, attention mechanisms, and input resolution, supported by systematic analysis to each modifications. This customization yields an architecture optimized for AV camera encoder achieving 8.79% mAP improvement over the baseline. We believe our effort could become a sweet cookbook of image encoders for AV and pave the way to the next-level drive system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aggelina Chatziagapi, Grigorios G. Chrysos, Dimitris Samaras</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MIGS (Multi-Identity Gaussian Splatting), a novel method that learns a single neural representation for multiple identities, using only monocular videos. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches for human avatars require per-identity optimization. However, learning a multi-identity representation presents advantages in robustly animating humans under arbitrary poses. We propose to construct a high-order tensor that combines all the learnable 3DGS parameters for all the training identities. By assuming a low-rank structure and factorizing the tensor, we model the complex rigid and non-rigid deformations of multiple subjects in a unified network, significantly reducing the total number of parameters. Our proposed approach leverages information from all the training identities, enabling robust animation under challenging unseen poses, outperforming existing approaches. We also demonstrate how it can be extended to learn unseen identities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07289">Deformable Feature Alignment and Refinement for Moving Infrared Dim-small Target Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengyan Luo, Yanping Xiang, Hu Wang, Luping Ji, Shuai Li, Mao Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of moving infrared dim-small targets has been a challenging and prevalent research topic. The current state-of-the-art methods are mainly based on ConvLSTM to aggregate information from adjacent frames to facilitate the detection of the current frame. However, these methods implicitly utilize motion information only in the training stage and fail to explicitly explore motion compensation, resulting in poor performance in the case of a video sequence including large motion. In this paper, we propose a Deformable Feature Alignment and Refinement (DFAR) method based on deformable convolution to explicitly use motion context in both the training and inference stages. Specifically, a Temporal Deformable Alignment (TDA) module based on the designed Dilated Convolution Attention Fusion (DCAF) block is developed to explicitly align the adjacent frames with the current frame at the feature level. Then, the feature refinement module adaptively fuses the aligned features and further aggregates useful spatio-temporal information by means of the proposed Attention-guided Deformable Fusion (AGDF) block. In addition, to improve the alignment of adjacent frames with the current frame, we extend the traditional loss function by introducing a new motion compensation loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DFAR method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets including DAUB and IRDST.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07307">Dual-stage Hyperspectral Image Classification Model with Spectral Supertoken</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peifu Liu, Tingfa Xu, Jie Wang, Huan Chen, Huiyan Bai, Jianan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification, a task that assigns pre-defined classes to each pixel in a hyperspectral image of remote sensing scenes, often faces challenges due to the neglect of correlations between spectrally similar pixels. This oversight can lead to inaccurate edge definitions and difficulties in managing minor spectral variations in contiguous areas. To address these issues, we introduce the novel Dual-stage Spectral Supertoken Classifier (DSTC), inspired by superpixel concepts. DSTC employs spectrum-derivative-based pixel clustering to group pixels with similar spectral characteristics into spectral supertokens. By projecting the classification of these tokens onto the image space, we achieve pixel-level results that maintain regional classification consistency and precise boundary. Moreover, recognizing the diversity within tokens, we propose a class-proportion-based soft label. This label adaptively assigns weights to different categories based on their prevalence, effectively managing data distribution imbalances and enhancing classification performance. Comprehensive experiments on WHU-OHS, IP, KSC, and UP datasets corroborate the robust classification capabilities of DSTC and the effectiveness of its individual components.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raza Imam, Mohammed Talha Alam, Umaima Rahman, Mohsen Guizani, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing vision-text contrastive learning models enhance representation transferability and support zero-shot prediction by matching paired image and caption embeddings while pushing unrelated pairs apart. However, astronomical image-label datasets are significantly smaller compared to general image and label datasets available from the internet. We introduce CosmoCLIP, an astronomical image-text contrastive learning framework precisely fine-tuned on the pre-trained CLIP model using SpaceNet and BLIP-based captions. SpaceNet, attained via FLARE, constitutes ~13k optimally distributed images, while BLIP acts as a rich knowledge extractor. The rich semantics derived from this SpaceNet and BLIP descriptions, when learned contrastively, enable CosmoCLIP to achieve superior generalization across various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Our results demonstrate that CosmoCLIP is a straightforward yet powerful framework, significantly outperforming CLIP in zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghang Li, Bangyan Liao, Xiuyuan LU, Peidong Liu, Shaojie Shen, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting a potential collision with leading vehicles is an essential functionality of any autonomous/assisted driving system. One bottleneck of existing vision-based solutions is that their updating rate is limited to the frame rate of standard cameras used. In this paper, we present a novel method that estimates the time to collision using a neuromorphic event-based camera, a biologically inspired visual sensor that can sense at exactly the same rate as scene dynamics. The core of the proposed algorithm consists of a two-step approach for efficient and accurate geometric model fitting on event data in a coarse-to-fine manner. The first step is a robust linear solver based on a novel geometric measurement that overcomes the partial observability of event-based normal flow. The second step further refines the resulting model via a spatio-temporal registration process formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming other alternative methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Hsuan Huang, Chia-Ching Lin, Chih-Fan Hsu, Ming-Ching Chang, Wei-Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy-labeled data is crucial for real-world applications. Traditional Noisy-Label Learning (NLL) methods categorize training data into clean and noisy sets based on the loss distribution of training samples. However, they often neglect that clean samples, especially those with intricate visual patterns, may also yield substantial losses. This oversight is particularly significant in datasets with Instance-Dependent Noise (IDN), where mislabeling probabilities correlate with visual appearance. Our approach explicitly distinguishes between clean vs.noisy and easy vs. hard samples. We identify training samples with small losses, assuming they have simple patterns and correct labels. Utilizing these easy samples, we hallucinate multiple anchors to select hard samples for label correction. Corrected hard samples, along with the easy samples, are used as labeled data in subsequent semi-supervised training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world IDN datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over other state-of-the-art NLL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Doanh C. Bui, Trinh Thi Le Vuong, Jin Tae Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Slide-level classification for whole-slide images (WSIs) has been widely recognized as a crucial problem in digital and computational pathology. Current approaches commonly consider WSIs as a bag of cropped patches and process them via multiple instance learning due to the large number of patches, which cannot fully explore the relationship among patches; in other words, the global information cannot be fully incorporated into decision making. Herein, we propose an efficient and effective slide-level classification model, named as FALFormer, that can process a WSI as a whole so as to fully exploit the relationship among the entire patches and to improve the classification performance. FALFormer is built based upon Transformers and self-attention mechanism. To lessen the computational burden of the original self-attention mechanism and to process the entire patches together in a WSI, FALFormer employs Nystr\"om self-attention which approximates the computation by using a smaller number of tokens or landmarks. For effective learning, FALFormer introduces feature-aware landmarks to enhance the representation power of the landmarks and the quality of the approximation. We systematically evaluate the performance of FALFormer using two public datasets, including CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA. The experimental results demonstrate that FALFormer achieves superior performance on both datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for the slide-level classification. This suggests that FALFormer can facilitate an accurate and precise analysis of WSIs, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis on WSIs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07345">Micro-Expression Recognition by Motion Feature Extraction based on Pre-training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruolin Li, Lu Wang, Tingting Yang, Lisheng Xu, Bingyang Ma, Yongchun Li, Hongchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are spontaneous, unconscious facial expressions that have promising applications in various fields such as psychotherapy and national security. Thus, micro-expression recognition (MER) has attracted more and more attention from researchers. Although various MER methods have emerged especially with the development of deep learning techniques, the task still faces several challenges, e.g. subtle motion and limited training data. To address these problems, we propose a novel motion extraction strategy (MoExt) for the MER task and use additional macro-expression data in the pre-training process. We primarily pretrain the feature separator and motion extractor using the contrastive loss, thus enabling them to extract representative motion features. In MoExt, shape features and texture features are first extracted separately from onset and apex frames, and then motion features related to MEs are extracted based on the shape features of both frames. To enable the model to more effectively separate features, we utilize the extracted motion features and the texture features from the onset frame to reconstruct the apex frame. Through pre-training, the module is enabled to extract inter-frame motion features of facial expressions while excluding irrelevant information. The feature separator and motion extractor are ultimately integrated into the MER network, which is then fine-tuned using the target ME data. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated on three commonly used datasets, i.e., CASME II, SMIC, SAMM, and CAS(ME)3 dataset. The results show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingling Chang, Haohui Yu, Shuxuan Fu, Zhiqiang Zeng, Chuangquan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: As a novel video representation method, Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) has shown great potential in the fields of video compression, video restoration, and video interpolation. In the process of representing videos using NeRV, each frame corresponds to an embedding, which is then reconstructed into a video frame sequence after passing through a small number of decoding layers (E-NeRV, HNeRV, etc.). However, this small number of decoding layers can easily lead to the problem of redundant model parameters due to the large proportion of parameters in a single decoding layer, which greatly restricts the video regression ability of neural network models. In this paper, we propose a multilayer neural representation for videos (MNeRV) and design a new decoder M-Decoder and its matching encoder M-Encoder. MNeRV has more encoding and decoding layers, which effectively alleviates the problem of redundant model parameters caused by too few layers. In addition, we design MNeRV blocks to perform more uniform and effective parameter allocation between decoding layers. In the field of video regression reconstruction, we achieve better reconstruction quality (+4.06 PSNR) with fewer parameters. Finally, we showcase MNeRV performance in downstream tasks such as video restoration and video interpolation. The source code of MNeRV is available at https://github.com/Aaronbtb/MNeRV.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Kuang, Hongyang Zhang, Lidong Cheng, Yinhao Liu, Yue Huang, Xinghao Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizable vehicle re-identification (ReID) aims to enable the well-trained model in diverse source domains to broadly adapt to unknown target domains without additional fine-tuning or retraining. However, it still faces the challenges of domain shift problem and has difficulty accurately generalizing to unknown target domains. This limitation occurs because the model relies heavily on primary domain-invariant features in the training data and pays less attention to potentially valuable secondary features. To solve this complex and common problem, this paper proposes the two-stage Multi-expert Knowledge Confrontation and Collaboration (MiKeCoCo) method, which incorporates multiple experts with unique perspectives into Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and fully leverages high-level semantic knowledge for comprehensive feature representation. Specifically, we propose to construct the learnable prompt set of all specific-perspective experts by adversarial learning in the latent space of visual features during the first stage of training. The learned prompt set with high-level semantics is then utilized to guide representation learning of the multi-level features for final knowledge fusion in the next stage. In this process of knowledge fusion, although multiple experts employ different assessment ways to examine the same vehicle, their common goal is to confirm the vehicle's true identity. Their collective decision can ensure the accuracy and consistency of the evaluation results. Furthermore, we design different image inputs for two-stage training, which include image component separation and diversity enhancement in order to extract the ID-related prompt representation and to obtain feature representation highlighted by all experts, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-context learning for vision data has been underexplored compared with that in natural language. Previous works studied image in-context learning, urging models to generate a single image guided by demonstrations. In this paper, we propose and study video in-context learning, where the model starts from an existing video clip and generates diverse potential future sequences, each semantically guided by the prompted video demonstrations. To achieve this, we provide a clear definition of the task, and train an autoregressive Transformer on video datasets. We thoroughly analyze the effect of different datasets and represent frames as discrete tokens, and then model them by next token predictions. We design various evaluation metrics, including both objective and subjective measures, to demonstrate the visual quality and semantic accuracy of generation results. Our model follows the scaling law and generates high-quality video clips that accurately align with the semantic guidance provided by in-context examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Tien Nguyen, Trinh Thi Le Vuong, Jin Tae Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, vision-language pre-trained models have emerged in computational pathology. Previous works generally focused on the alignment of image-text pairs via the contrastive pre-training paradigm. Such pre-trained models have been applied to pathology image classification in zero-shot learning or transfer learning fashion. Herein, we hypothesize that the pre-trained vision-language models can be utilized for quantitative histopathology image analysis through a simple image-to-text retrieval. To this end, we propose a Text-based Quantitative and Explainable histopathology image analysis, which we call TQx. Given a set of histopathology images, we adopt a pre-trained vision-language model to retrieve a word-of-interest pool. The retrieved words are then used to quantify the histopathology images and generate understandable feature embeddings due to the direct mapping to the text description. To evaluate the proposed method, the text-based embeddings of four histopathology image datasets are utilized to perform clustering and classification tasks. The results demonstrate that TQx is able to quantify and analyze histopathology images that are comparable to the prevalent visual models in computational pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: The complexity of clouds, particularly in terms of texture detail at high resolutions, has not been well explored by most existing cloud detection networks. This paper introduces the High-Resolution Cloud Detection Network (HR-cloud-Net), which utilizes a hierarchical high-resolution integration approach. HR-cloud-Net integrates a high-resolution representation module, layer-wise cascaded feature fusion module, and multi-resolution pyramid pooling module to effectively capture complex cloud features. This architecture preserves detailed cloud texture information while facilitating feature exchange across different resolutions, thereby enhancing overall performance in cloud detection. Additionally, a novel approach is introduced wherein a student view, trained on noisy augmented images, is supervised by a teacher view processing normal images. This setup enables the student to learn from cleaner supervisions provided by the teacher, leading to improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three optical satellite image cloud detection datasets validate the superior performance of HR-cloud-Net compared to existing methods.The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/kunzhan/HR-cloud-Net}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpu Liu, Baolin Hou, Hanyun Wang, Ke Xu, Jianwei Wan, Yulan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: To further promote the development of multimodal point cloud completion, we contribute a large-scale multimodal point cloud completion benchmark ModelNet-MPC with richer shape categories and more diverse test data, which contains nearly 400,000 pairs of high-quality point clouds and rendered images of 40 categories. Besides the fully supervised point cloud completion task, two additional tasks including denoising completion and zero-shot learning completion are proposed in ModelNet-MPC, to simulate real-world scenarios and verify the robustness to noise and the transfer ability across categories of current methods. Meanwhile, considering that existing multimodal completion pipelines usually adopt a unidirectional fusion mechanism and ignore the shape prior contained in the image modality, we propose a Dual-Modality Feature Interaction Network (DuInNet) in this paper. DuInNet iteratively interacts features between point clouds and images to learn both geometric and texture characteristics of shapes with the dual feature interactor. To adapt to specific tasks such as fully supervised, denoising, and zero-shot learning point cloud completions, an adaptive point generator is proposed to generate complete point clouds in blocks with different weights for these two modalities. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet-ViPC and ModelNet-MPC benchmarks demonstrate that DuInNet exhibits superiority, robustness and transfer ability in all completion tasks over state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjia Han</p>
<p>Abstract: As multi-scale features are necessary for human pose estimation tasks, high-resolution networks are widely applied.
  To improve efficiency, lightweight modules are proposed to replace costly point-wise convolutions in high-resolution networks, including channel weighting and spatial weighting methods.
  However, they fail to maintain the consistency of weights and capture global spatial information.
  To address these problems, we present a Grouped lightweight High-Resolution Network (Greit-HRNet), in which we propose a Greit block including a group method Grouped Channel Weighting (GCW) and a spatial weighting method Global Spatial Weighting (GSW).
  GCW modules group conditional channel weighting to make weights stable and maintain the high-resolution features with the deepening of the network, while GSW modules effectively extract global spatial information and exchange information across channels.
  In addition, we apply the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) method to improve the whole efficiency of our Greit-HRNet.
  Our experiments on both MS-COCO and MPII human pose estimation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our Greit-HRNet, outperforming other state-of-the-art lightweight networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueyu Hu, Chenhao Zhang, Onur G. Guleryuz, Debargha Mukherjee, Yao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of high resolution videos posts great storage and bandwidth pressure on cloud video services, driving the development of next-generation video codecs. Despite great progress made in neural video coding, existing approaches are still far from economical deployment considering the complexity and rate-distortion performance tradeoff. To clear the roadblocks for neural video coding, in this paper we propose a new framework featuring standard compatibility, high performance, and low decoding complexity. We employ a set of jointly optimized neural pre- and post-processors, wrapping a standard video codec, to encode videos at different resolutions. The rate-distorion optimal downsampling ratio is signaled to the decoder at the per-sequence level for each target rate. We design a low complexity neural post-processor architecture that can handle different upsampling ratios. The change of resolution exploits the spatial redundancy in high-resolution videos, while the neural wrapper further achieves rate-distortion performance improvement through end-to-end optimization with a codec proxy. Our light-weight post-processor architecture has a complexity of 516 MACs / pixel, and achieves 9.3% BD-Rate reduction over VVC on the UVG dataset, and 6.4% on AOM CTC Class A1. Our approach has the potential to further advance the performance of the latest video coding standards using neural processing with minimal added complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangyang Ouyang, Ruicong Liu, Yifei Huang, Ryosuke Furuta, Yoichi Sato</p>
<p>Abstract: Delving into the realm of egocentric vision, the advancement of referring video object segmentation (RVOS) stands as pivotal in understanding human activities. However, existing RVOS task primarily relies on static attributes such as object names to segment target objects, posing challenges in distinguishing target objects from background objects and in identifying objects undergoing state changes. To address these problems, this work proposes a novel action-aware RVOS setting called ActionVOS, aiming at segmenting only active objects in egocentric videos using human actions as a key language prompt. This is because human actions precisely describe the behavior of humans, thereby helping to identify the objects truly involved in the interaction and to understand possible state changes. We also build a method tailored to work under this specific setting. Specifically, we develop an action-aware labeling module with an efficient action-guided focal loss. Such designs enable ActionVOS model to prioritize active objects with existing readily-available annotations. Experimental results on VISOR dataset reveal that ActionVOS significantly reduces the mis-segmentation of inactive objects, confirming that actions help the ActionVOS model understand objects' involvement. Further evaluations on VOST and VSCOS datasets show that the novel ActionVOS setting enhances segmentation performance when encountering challenging circumstances involving object state changes. We will make our implementation available at https://github.com/ut-vision/ActionVOS.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the significant development of large models in recent years, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), LVLMs present great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the multi-resource real-world applications and the complexity of multi-modal processing. However, the vulnerability of LVLMs is relatively underexplored, posing potential security risks in daily usage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the various forms of existing LVLM attacks. Specifically, we first introduce the background of attacks targeting LVLMs, including the attack preliminary, attack challenges, and attack resources. Then, we systematically review the development of LVLM attack methods, such as adversarial attacks that manipulate model outputs, jailbreak attacks that exploit model vulnerabilities for unauthorized actions, prompt injection attacks that engineer the prompt type and pattern, and data poisoning that affects model training. Finally, we discuss promising research directions in the future. We believe that our survey provides insights into the current landscape of LVLM vulnerabilities, inspiring more researchers to explore and mitigate potential safety issues in LVLM developments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhong, Chenhui Tang, Yumeng Yang, Ruoxi Qi, Kang Zhou, Yuqi Gong, Pheng Ann Heng, Janet H. Hsiao, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye gaze that reveals human observational patterns has increasingly been incorporated into solutions for vision tasks. Despite recent explorations on leveraging gaze to aid deep networks, few studies exploit gaze as an efficient annotation approach for medical image segmentation which typically entails heavy annotating costs. In this paper, we propose to collect dense weak supervision for medical image segmentation with a gaze annotation scheme. To train with gaze, we propose a multi-level framework that trains multiple networks from discriminative human attention, simulated with a set of pseudo-masks derived by applying hierarchical thresholds on gaze heatmaps. Furthermore, to mitigate gaze noise, a cross-level consistency is exploited to regularize overfitting noisy labels, steering models toward clean patterns learned by peer networks. The proposed method is validated on two public medical datasets of polyp and prostate segmentation tasks. We contribute a high-quality gaze dataset entitled GazeMedSeg as an extension to the popular medical segmentation datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first gaze dataset for medical image segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that gaze annotation outperforms previous label-efficient annotation schemes in terms of both performance and annotation time.

It considers not only the pixel intensities of the images but also the spatial relationships between the pixels. In this project, we apply the mutual information formula to image matching, where image A is the moving object and image B is the target object and calculate the mutual information between them to evaluate the similarity between the images. For comparison, we also used entropy and information-gain methods to test the dependency of the images. We also investigated the effect of different environments on the mutual information of the same image and used experiments and plots to demonstrate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghoon Yu, Paul Hongsuck Seo, Jeany Son</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new framework that automatically generates high-quality segmentation masks with their referring expressions as pseudo supervisions for referring image segmentation (RIS). These pseudo supervisions allow the training of any supervised RIS methods without the cost of manual labeling. To achieve this, we incorporate existing segmentation and image captioning foundation models, leveraging their broad generalization capabilities. However, the naive incorporation of these models may generate non-distinctive expressions that do not distinctively refer to the target masks. To address this challenge, we propose two-fold strategies that generate distinctive captions: 1) 'distinctive caption sampling', a new decoding method for the captioning model, to generate multiple expression candidates with detailed words focusing on the target. 2) 'distinctiveness-based text filtering' to further validate the candidates and filter out those with a low level of distinctiveness. These two strategies ensure that the generated text supervisions can distinguish the target from other objects, making them appropriate for the RIS annotations. Our method significantly outperforms both weakly and zero-shot SoTA methods on the RIS benchmark datasets. It also surpasses fully supervised methods in unseen domains, proving its capability to tackle the open-world challenge within RIS. Furthermore, integrating our method with human annotations yields further improvements, highlighting its potential in semi-supervised learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Fang, Peng Wu, Yawei Li, Xinxin Zhang, Xiankai Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) is attracting increasing attention due to its ability to segment and track arbitrary objects. However, the recent Open-Vocabulary VIS attempts obtained unsatisfactory results, especially in terms of generalization ability of novel categories. We discover that the domain gap between the VLM features (e.g., CLIP) and the instance queries and the underutilization of temporal consistency are two central causes. To mitigate these issues, we design and train a novel Open-Vocabulary VIS baseline called OVFormer. OVFormer utilizes a lightweight module for unified embedding alignment between query embeddings and CLIP image embeddings to remedy the domain gap. Unlike previous image-based training methods, we conduct video-based model training and deploy a semi-online inference scheme to fully mine the temporal consistency in the video. Without bells and whistles, OVFormer achieves 21.9 mAP with a ResNet-50 backbone on LV-VIS, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art performance by 7.7. Extensive experiments on some Close-Vocabulary VIS datasets also demonstrate the strong zero-shot generalization ability of OVFormer (+ 7.6 mAP on YouTube-VIS 2019, + 3.9 mAP on OVIS).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianghao Kong, Jinyu Chen, Wenguan Wang, Hang Su, Xiaolin Hu, Yi Yang, Si Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction generation is a vital and multidisciplinary research area with broad applications. Existing instruction generation models are limited to generating instructions in a single style from a particular dataset, and the style and content of generated instructions cannot be controlled. Moreover, most existing instruction generation methods also disregard the spatial modeling of the navigation environment. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose C-Instructor, which utilizes the chain-of-thought-style prompt for style-controllable and content-controllable instruction generation. Firstly, we propose a Chain of Thought with Landmarks (CoTL) mechanism, which guides the LLM to identify key landmarks and then generate complete instructions. CoTL renders generated instructions more accessible to follow and offers greater controllability over the manipulation of landmark objects. Furthermore, we present a Spatial Topology Modeling Task to facilitate the understanding of the spatial structure of the environment. Finally, we introduce a Style-Mixed Training policy, harnessing the prior knowledge of LLMs to enable style control for instruction generation based on different prompts within a single model instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that instructions generated by C-Instructor outperform those generated by previous methods in text metrics, navigation guidance evaluation, and user studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have shown great success in semantic segmentation tasks. Efforts have been made to integrate CNNs with Transformer models to capture both local and global context interactions. However, there is still room for enhancement, particularly when considering constraints on computational resources. In this paper, we introduce HAFormer, a model that combines the hierarchical features extraction ability of CNNs with the global dependency modeling capability of Transformers to tackle lightweight semantic segmentation challenges. Specifically, we design a Hierarchy-Aware Pixel-Excitation (HAPE) module for adaptive multi-scale local feature extraction. During the global perception modeling, we devise an Efficient Transformer (ET) module streamlining the quadratic calculations associated with traditional Transformers. Moreover, a correlation-weighted Fusion (cwF) module selectively merges diverse feature representations, significantly enhancing predictive accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganlin Yang, Kaidong Zhang, Jingjing Fu, Dong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aliasing artifacts in renderings produced by Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a long-standing but complex issue in the field of 3D implicit representation, which arises from a multitude of intricate causes and was mitigated by designing more advanced but complex scene parameterization methods before. In this paper, we present a Diffusion-based restoration method for anti-aliasing Neural Radiance Field (Drantal-NeRF). We consider the anti-aliasing issue from a low-level restoration perspective by viewing aliasing artifacts as a kind of degradation model added to clean ground truths. By leveraging the powerful prior knowledge encapsulated in diffusion model, we could restore the high-realism anti-aliasing renderings conditioned on aliased low-quality counterparts. We further employ a feature-wrapping operation to ensure multi-view restoration consistency and finetune the VAE decoder to better adapt to the scene-specific data distribution. Our proposed method is easy to implement and agnostic to various NeRF backbones. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging large-scale urban scenes as well as unbounded 360-degree scenes and achieve substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Fent, Fabian Kuttenreich, Florian Ruch, Farija Rizwin, Stefan Juergens, Lorenz Lechermann, Christian Nissler, Andrea Perl, Ulrich Voll, Min Yan, Markus Lienkamp</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous trucking is a promising technology that can greatly impact modern logistics and the environment. Ensuring its safety on public roads is one of the main duties that requires an accurate perception of the environment. To achieve this, machine learning methods rely on large datasets, but to this day, no such datasets are available for autonomous trucks. In this work, we present MAN TruckScenes, the first multimodal dataset for autonomous trucking. MAN TruckScenes allows the research community to come into contact with truck-specific challenges, such as trailer occlusions, novel sensor perspectives, and terminal environments for the first time. It comprises more than 740 scenes of 20 s each within a multitude of different environmental conditions. The sensor set includes 4 cameras, 6 lidar, 6 radar sensors, 2 IMUs, and a high-precision GNSS. The dataset's 3D bounding boxes were manually annotated and carefully reviewed to achieve a high quality standard. Bounding boxes are available for 27 object classes, 15 attributes, and a range of more than 230 m. The scenes are tagged according to 34 distinct scene tags, and all objects are tracked throughout the scene to promote a wide range of applications. Additionally, MAN TruckScenes is the first dataset to provide 4D radar data with 360{\deg} coverage and is thereby the largest radar dataset with annotated 3D bounding boxes. Finally, we provide extensive dataset analysis and baseline results. The dataset, development kit and more are available online.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianfang Sun, Zhizhong Zhang, Xin Tan, Yanyun Qu, Yuan Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-camera 3D representation pretraining has shown significant promise for 3D perception tasks and related applications. However, two issues widely exist in this framework: 1) Solely keyframes are used for training. For example, in nuScenes, a substantial quantity of unpaired LiDAR and camera frames remain unutilized, limiting the representation capabilities of the pretrained network. 2) The contrastive loss erroneously distances points and image regions with identical semantics but from different frames, disturbing the semantic consistency of the learned presentations. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Foundation-Model-driven sample exploring module to meticulously select LiDAR-Image pairs from unexplored frames, enriching the original training set. We utilized timestamps and the semantic priors from VFMs to identify well-synchronized training pairs and to discover samples with diverse content. Moreover, we design a cross- and intra-modal conflict-aware contrastive loss using the semantic mask labels of VFMs to avoid contrasting semantically similar points and image regions. Our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pretraining frameworks across three major public autonomous driving datasets: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and Waymo on 3D semantic segmentation by +3.0\%, +3.0\%, and +3.3\% in mIoU, respectively. Furthermore, our approach exhibits adaptable generalization to different 3D backbones and typical semantic masks generated by non-VFM models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Ming Tang, Yi-Xing Peng, Jingke Meng, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to learn sequential classes with limited samples in a few-shot fashion. Inherited from the classical class-incremental learning setting, the popular benchmark of FSCIL uses averaged accuracy (aAcc) and last-task averaged accuracy (lAcc) as the evaluation metrics. However, we reveal that such evaluation metrics may not provide adequate emphasis on the novel class performance, and the continual learning ability of FSCIL methods could be ignored under this benchmark. In this work, as a complement to existing metrics, we offer a new metric called generalized average accuracy (gAcc) which is designed to provide an extra equitable evaluation by incorporating different perspectives of the performance under the guidance of a parameter $\alpha$. We also present an overall metric in the form of the area under the curve (AUC) along the $\alpha$. Under the guidance of gAcc, we release the potential of intermediate features of the vision transformers to boost the novel-class performance. Taking information from intermediate layers which are less class-specific and more generalizable, we manage to rectify the final features, leading to a more generalizable transformer-based FSCIL framework. Without complex network designs or cumbersome training procedures, our method outperforms existing FSCIL methods at aAcc and gAcc on three datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyang Ma, Ziqi Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Zhongang Qi, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Yingmin Luo, Xu Li, Xiaojuan Qi, Ying Shan, Weiming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the content of events occurring in the video and their inherent temporal logic is crucial for video-text retrieval. However, web-crawled pre-training datasets often lack sufficient event information, and the widely adopted video-level cross-modal contrastive learning also struggles to capture detailed and complex video-text event alignment. To address these challenges, we make improvements from both data and model perspectives. In terms of pre-training data, we focus on supplementing the missing specific event content and event temporal transitions with the proposed event augmentation strategies. Based on the event-augmented data, we construct a novel Event-Aware Video-Text Retrieval model, ie, EA-VTR, which achieves powerful video-text retrieval ability through superior video event awareness. EA-VTR can efficiently encode frame-level and video-level visual representations simultaneously, enabling detailed event content and complex event temporal cross-modal alignment, ultimately enhancing the comprehensive understanding of video events. Our method not only significantly outperforms existing approaches on multiple datasets for Text-to-Video Retrieval and Video Action Recognition tasks, but also demonstrates superior event content perceive ability on Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval and Video Moment Retrieval tasks, as well as outstanding event temporal logic understanding ability on Test of Time task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Chen, Zongyang Ma, Ziqi Zhang, Zhongang Qi, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Junfu Pu, Ying Shan, Xiaojuan Qi, Weiming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dominant dual-encoder models enable efficient image-text retrieval but suffer from limited accuracy while the cross-encoder models offer higher accuracy at the expense of efficiency. Distilling cross-modality matching knowledge from cross-encoder to dual-encoder provides a natural approach to harness their strengths. Thus we investigate the following valuable question: how to make cross-encoder a good teacher for dual-encoder? Our findings are threefold:(1) Cross-modal similarity score distribution of cross-encoder is more concentrated while the result of dual-encoder is nearly normal making vanilla logit distillation less effective. However ranking distillation remains practical as it is not affected by the score distribution.(2) Only the relative order between hard negatives conveys valid knowledge while the order information between easy negatives has little significance.(3) Maintaining the coordination between distillation loss and dual-encoder training loss is beneficial for knowledge transfer. Based on these findings we propose a novel Contrastive Partial Ranking Distillation (CPRD) method which implements the objective of mimicking relative order between hard negative samples with contrastive learning. This approach coordinates with the training of the dual-encoder effectively transferring valid knowledge from the cross-encoder to the dual-encoder. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and ranking tasks show that our method surpasses other distillation methods and significantly improves the accuracy of dual-encoder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Kravets, V. Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is a crucial area of research. It is driven by the need to remove sensitive information from models to safeguard individuals' right to be forgotten under rigorous regulations such as GDPR. In this work, we focus on unlearning within CLIP, a dual vision-language encoder model trained on a massive dataset of image-text pairs using contrastive loss. To achieve forgetting we expand the application of Lipschitz regularization to the multimodal context of CLIP. Specifically, we ensure the smoothing of both visual and textual embeddings associated with the class intended to be forgotten relative to the perturbation introduced to the samples from that class. Additionally, importantly, we remove the necessity for real forgetting data by generating synthetic samples through gradient ascent maximizing the target class. Our forgetting procedure is iterative, where we track accuracy on a synthetic forget set and stop when accuracy falls below a chosen threshold. We employ a selective layers update strategy based on their average absolute gradient value to mitigate over-forgetting. We validate our approach on several standard datasets and provide thorough ablation analysis and comparisons with previous work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte T\"olle, Fernando Navarro, Sebastian Eble, Ivo Wolf, Bjoern Menze, Sandy Engelhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is one popular paradigm to train a joint model in a distributed, privacy-preserving environment. But partial annotations pose an obstacle meaning that categories of labels are heterogeneous over clients. We propose to learn a joint backbone in a federated manner, while each site receives its own multi-label segmentation head. By using Bayesian techniques we observe that the different segmentation heads although only trained on the individual client's labels also learn information about the other labels not present at the respective site. This information is encoded in their predictive uncertainty. To obtain a final prediction we leverage this uncertainty and perform a weighted averaging of the ensemble of distributed segmentation heads, which allows us to segment "locally unknown" structures. With our method, which we refer to as FUNAvg, we are even on-par with the models trained and tested on the same dataset on average.

<p>Abstract: FungiCLEF 2024 addresses the fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) of fungi species, with a focus on identifying poisonous species.

<p>Abstract: We explore the use of deep learning to localise galactic structures in low surface brightness (LSB) images. LSB imaging reveals many interesting structures, though these are frequently confused with galactic dust contamination, due to a strong local visual similarity. We propose a novel unified approach to multi-class segmentation of galactic structures and of extended amorphous image contaminants. Our panoptic segmentation model combines Mask R-CNN with a contaminant specialised network and utilises an adaptive preprocessing layer to better capture the subtle features of LSB images. Further, a human-in-the-loop training scheme is employed to augment ground truth labels. These different approaches are evaluated in turn, and together greatly improve the detection of both galactic structures and contaminants in LSB images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shortwave-infrared(SWIR) spectral information,ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 2.5{\mu}m, breaks the limitations of traditional color cameras in acquiring scene information and has been used in many fields. However, conventional SWIR hyperspectral imaging systems face challenges due to their bulky setups and low acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a snapshot SWIR hyperspectral imaging system based on a metasurface filter and a corresponding filter selection method to achieve the lowest correlation coefficient among these filters.This systemhas the advantages of small size and snapshot imaging. We propose a novel inter and intra prior learning unfolding framework proposed to achieve high-quality SWIR hyperspectral image reconstruction, which bridges the gap between prior learning and cross-stage information interaction. We also design an adaptive feature transfer mechanism to adaptively the transfer contextual correlation of multi-scale encoder features to prevent detailed information loss in the decoder. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct HSI with high speed and superior performance over existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-training models have promoted the development of histopathology image analysis. However, existing self-supervised methods for histopathology images focus on learning patch features, while there is still a lack of available pre-training models for WSI-level feature learning. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for pan-cancer WSI-level representation pre-training with the designed position-aware masked autoencoder (PAMA). Meanwhile, we propose the position-aware cross-attention (PACA) module with a kernel reorientation (KRO) strategy and an anchor dropout (AD) mechanism. The KRO strategy can capture the complete semantic structure and eliminate ambiguity in WSIs, and the AD contributes to enhancing the robustness and generalization of the model. We evaluated our method on 6 large-scale datasets from multiple organs for pan-cancer classification tasks. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of PAMA in generalized and discriminative WSI representation learning and pan-cancer WSI pre-training. The proposed method was also compared with \R{7} WSI analysis methods. The experimental results have indicated that our proposed PAMA is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.The code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/WkEEn/PAMA.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a significant advancement in natural image segmentation, exhibiting potent zero-shot performance suitable for various downstream image segmentation tasks. However, directly utilizing the pretrained SAM for Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) task falls short in achieving satisfying performance due to a notable domain gap between natural and infrared images. Unlike a visible light camera, a thermal imager reveals an object's temperature distribution by capturing infrared radiation. Small targets often show a subtle temperature transition at the object's boundaries. To address this issue, we propose the IRSAM model for IRSTD, which improves SAM's encoder-decoder architecture to learn better feature representation of infrared small objects. Specifically, we design a Perona-Malik diffusion (PMD)-based block and incorporate it into multiple levels of SAM's encoder to help it capture essential structural features while suppressing noise. Additionally, we devise a Granularity-Aware Decoder (GAD) to fuse the multi-granularity feature from the encoder to capture structural information that may be lost in long-distance modeling. Extensive experiments on the public datasets, including NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K, validate the design choice of IRSAM and its significant superiority over representative state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiwen Diao, Bo Wan, Xu Jia, Yunzhi Zhuge, Ying Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has emerged as a flourishing research field for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks, greatly reducing trainable parameters while grappling with memory challenges during fine-tuning. To address it, memory-efficient series (METL) avoid backpropagating gradients through the large backbone. However, they compromise by exclusively relying on frozen intermediate outputs and limiting the exhaustive exploration of prior knowledge from pre-trained models. Moreover, the dependency and redundancy between cross-layer features are frequently overlooked, thereby submerging more discriminative representations and causing an inherent performance gap (vs. conventional PETL methods). Hence, we propose an innovative METL strategy called SHERL for resource-limited scenarios to decouple the entire adaptation into two successive and complementary processes. In the early route, intermediate outputs are consolidated via an anti-redundancy operation, enhancing their compatibility for subsequent interactions; thereby in the late route, utilizing minimal late pre-trained layers could alleviate the peak demand on memory overhead and regulate these fairly flexible features into more adaptive and powerful representations for new domains. Extensive ablations on vision-and-language and language-only tasks show that SHERL combines the strengths of both parameter and memory-efficient techniques, performing on-par or better across diverse architectures with lower memory during fine-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Li, Jihua Zhu, Yifan Xie, Mingchen Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration serves as a cornerstone of various computer vision tasks. Previous approaches typically adhere to a global paradigm, where a pose graph is initially constructed followed by motion synchronization to determine the absolute pose. However, this separated approach may not fully leverage the characteristics of multiview registration and might struggle with low-overlap scenarios. In this paper, we propose an incremental multiview point cloud registration method that progressively registers all scans to a growing meta-shape. To determine the incremental ordering, we employ a two-stage coarse-to-fine strategy for point cloud candidate retrieval. The first stage involves the coarse selection of scans based on neighbor fusion-enhanced global aggregation features, while the second stage further reranks candidates through geometric-based matching. Additionally, we apply a transformation averaging technique to mitigate accumulated errors during the registration process. Finally, we utilize a Reservoir sampling-based technique to address density variance issues while reducing computational load. Comprehensive experimental results across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Istv\'an S\'ar\'andi, Gerard Pons-Moll</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosive growth of available training data, single-image 3D human modeling is ahead of a transition to a data-centric paradigm. A key to successfully exploiting data scale is to design flexible models that can be supervised from various heterogeneous data sources produced by different researchers or vendors. To this end, we propose a simple yet powerful paradigm for seamlessly unifying different human pose and shape-related tasks and datasets. Our formulation is centered on the ability - both at training and test time - to query any arbitrary point of the human volume, and obtain its estimated location in 3D. We achieve this by learning a continuous neural field of body point localizer functions, each of which is a differently parameterized 3D heatmap-based convolutional point localizer (detector). For generating parametric output, we propose an efficient post-processing step for fitting SMPL-family body models to nonparametric joint and vertex predictions. With this approach, we can naturally exploit differently annotated data sources including mesh, 2D/3D skeleton and dense pose, without having to convert between them, and thereby train large-scale 3D human mesh and skeleton estimation models that outperform the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks including 3DPW, EMDB and SSP-3D by a considerable margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Peer, Robert Sablatnig, Olga Serbaeva, Isabelle Marthot-Santaniello</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a character-based approach for enhancing writer retrieval performance in the context of Greek papyri. Our contribution lies in introducing character-level annotations for frequently used characters, in our case the trigram kai and four additional letters (epsilon, kappa, mu, omega), in Greek texts. We use a state-of-the-art writer retrieval approach based on NetVLAD and compare a character-level-based feature aggregation method against the current default baseline of using small patches located at SIFT keypoint locations for building the page descriptors. We demonstrate that by using only about 15 characters per page, we are able to boost the performance up to 4% mAP (a relative improvement of 11%) on the GRK-120 dataset. Additionally, our qualitative analysis offers insights into the similarity scores of SIFT patches and specific characters. We publish the dataset with character-level annotations, including a quality label and our binarized images for further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Paramonov, Jia-Xing Zhong, Umberto Michieli, Jijoong Moon, Mete Ozay</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address a recent trend in robotic home appliances to include vision systems on personal devices, capable of personalizing the appliances on the fly. In particular, we formulate and address an important technical task of personal object search, which involves localization and identification of personal items of interest on images captured by robotic appliances, with each item referenced only by a few annotated images. The task is crucial for robotic home appliances and mobile systems, which need to process personal visual scenes or to operate with particular personal objects (e.g., for grasping or navigation). In practice, personal object search presents two main technical challenges. First, a robot vision system needs to be able to distinguish between many fine-grained classes, in the presence of occlusions and clutter. Second, the strict resource requirements for the on-device system restrict the usage of most state-of-the-art methods for few-shot learning and often prevent on-device adaptation. In this work, we propose Swiss DINO: a simple yet effective framework for one-shot personal object search based on the recent DINOv2 transformer model, which was shown to have strong zero-shot generalization properties. Swiss DINO handles challenging on-device personalized scene understanding requirements and does not require any adaptation training. We show significant improvement (up to 55%) in segmentation and recognition accuracy compared to the common lightweight solutions, and significant footprint reduction of backbone inference time (up to 100x) and GPU consumption (up to 10x) compared to the heavy transformer-based solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Zhang, Han Wang, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG), designed to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, is all about learning invariance against domain shifts utilizing sufficient supervision signals. Yet, the scarcity of such labeled data has led to the rise of unsupervised domain generalization (UDG) - a more important yet challenging task in that models are trained across diverse domains in an unsupervised manner and eventually tested on unseen domains. UDG is fast gaining attention but is still far from well-studied. To close the research gap, we propose a novel learning framework designed for UDG, termed the Disentangled Masked Auto Encoder (DisMAE), aiming to discover the disentangled representations that faithfully reveal the intrinsic features and superficial variations without access to the class label. At its core is the distillation of domain-invariant semantic features, which cannot be distinguished by domain classifier, while filtering out the domain-specific variations (for example, color schemes and texture patterns) that are unstable and redundant. Notably, DisMAE co-trains the asymmetric dual-branch architecture with semantic and lightweight variation encoders, offering dynamic data manipulation and representation level augmentation capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (i.e., DomainNet, PACS, VLCS, Colored MNIST) with both DG and UDG tasks demonstrate that DisMAE can achieve competitive OOD performance compared with the state-of-the-art DG and UDG baselines, which shed light on potential research line in improving the generalization ability with large-scale unlabeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irit Chelly, Shahaf E. Finder, Shira Ifergane, Oren Freifeld</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonlinear activation functions are pivotal to the success of deep neural nets, and choosing the appropriate activation function can significantly affect their performance. Most networks use fixed activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU, etc.), and this choice might limit their expressiveness. Furthermore, different layers may benefit from diverse activation functions. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in trainable activation functions. In this paper, we introduce DiTAC, a trainable highly-expressive activation function based on an efficient diffeomorphic transformation (called CPAB). Despite introducing only a negligible number of trainable parameters, DiTAC enhances model expressiveness and performance, often yielding substantial improvements. It also outperforms existing activation functions (regardless whether the latter are fixed or trainable) in tasks such as semantic segmentation, image generation, regression problems, and image classification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatai Ji, Shilong Zhang, Jie Wu, Peize Sun, Weifeng Chen, Xuefeng Xiao, Sidi Yang, Yujiu Yang, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Vision-Language models (LVLMs) has demonstrated a spectrum of emergent capabilities. Nevertheless, current models only focus on the visual content of a single scenario, while their ability to associate instances across different scenes has not yet been explored, which is essential for understanding complex visual content, such as movies with multiple characters and intricate plots. Towards movie understanding, a critical initial step for LVLMs is to unleash the potential of character identities memory and recognition across multiple visual scenarios. To achieve the goal, we propose visual instruction tuning with ID reference and develop an ID-Aware Large Vision-Language Model, IDA-VLM. Furthermore, our research introduces a novel benchmark MM-ID, to examine LVLMs on instance IDs memory and recognition across four dimensions: matching, location, question-answering, and captioning. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing LVLMs in recognizing and associating instance identities with ID reference. This paper paves the way for future artificial intelligence systems to possess multi-identity visual inputs, thereby facilitating the comprehension of complex visual narratives like movies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comprehending natural language instructions is a charming property for both 2D and 3D layout synthesis systems. Existing methods implicitly model object joint distributions and express object relations, hindering generation's controllability. We introduce InstructLayout, a novel generative framework that integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve controllability and fidelity for 2D and 3D layout synthesis. The proposed semantic graph prior learns layout appearances and object distributions simultaneously, demonstrating versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 2D and 3D scene synthesis, we respectively curate two high-quality datasets of layout-instruction pairs from public Internet resources with large language and multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in both 2D and 3D layout synthesis tasks. Thorough ablation studies confirm the efficacy of crucial design components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Du, Shaoming Zheng, Yinsong Wang, Wenjia Bai, Declan P. O'Regan, Chen Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Images and structured tables are essential parts of real-world databases. Though tabular-image representation learning is promising to create new insights, it remains a challenging task, as tabular data is typically heterogeneous and incomplete, presenting significant modality disparities with images. Earlier works have mainly focused on simple modality fusion strategies in complete data scenarios, without considering the missing data issue, and thus are limited in practice. In this paper, we propose TIP, a novel tabular-image pre-training framework for learning multimodal representations robust to incomplete tabular data. Specifically, TIP investigates a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy, including a masked tabular reconstruction task for tackling data missingness, and image-tabular matching and contrastive learning objectives to capture multimodal information. Moreover, TIP proposes a versatile tabular encoder tailored for incomplete, heterogeneous tabular data and a multimodal interaction module for inter-modality representation learning. Experiments are performed on downstream multimodal classification tasks using both natural and medical image datasets. The results show that TIP outperforms state-of-the-art supervised/SSL image/multimodal algorithms in both complete and incomplete data scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Hao, Florent Forest, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on source-free domain adaptation for object detection in computer vision. This task is challenging and of great practical interest, due to the cost of obtaining annotated data sets for every new domain. Recent research has proposed various solutions for Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD), most being variations of teacher-student architectures with diverse feature alignment, regularization and pseudo-label selection strategies. Our work investigates simpler approaches and their performance compared to more complex SFOD methods in several adaptation scenarios. We highlight the importance of batch normalization layers in the detector backbone, and show that adapting only the batch statistics is a strong baseline for SFOD. We propose a simple extension of a Mean Teacher with strong-weak augmentation in the source-free setting, Source-Free Unbiased Teacher (SF-UT), and show that it actually outperforms most of the previous SFOD methods. Additionally, we showcase that an even simpler strategy consisting in training on a fixed set of pseudo-labels can achieve similar performance to the more complex teacher-student mutual learning, while being computationally efficient and mitigating the major issue of teacher-student collapse. We conduct experiments on several adaptation tasks using benchmark driving datasets including (Foggy)Cityscapes, Sim10k and KITTI, and achieve a notable improvement of 4.7\% AP50 on Cityscapes$\rightarrow$Foggy-Cityscapes compared with the latest state-of-the-art in SFOD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haruna Yunusa, Qin Shiyin, Abdulrahman Hamman Adama Chukkol, Isah Bello, Adamu Lawan</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent emergence of hybrid models has introduced another transformative approach to solving computer vision tasks, slowly shifting away from conventional CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and ViT (Vision Transformer). However, not enough effort has been made to efficiently combine these two approaches to improve capturing long-range dependencies prevalent in complex images. In this paper, we introduce iiANET (Inception Inspired Attention Network), an efficient hybrid model designed to capture long-range dependencies in complex images. The fundamental building block, iiABlock, integrates global 2D-MHSA (Multi-Head Self-Attention) with Registers, MBConv2 (MobileNetV2-based convolution), and dilated convolution in parallel, enabling the model to adeptly leverage self-attention for capturing long-range dependencies while utilizing MBConv2 for effective local-detail extraction and dilated convolution for efficiently expanding the kernel receptive field to capture more contextual information. Lastly, we serially integrate an ECANET (Efficient Channel Attention Network) at the end of each iiABlock to calibrate channel-wise attention for enhanced model performance. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparative evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates improved performance over some state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Banks, Bernat Rovira-Lastra, Jordi Martinez-Gomis, Akhilanand Chaurasia, Yunpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Occlusal contacts are the locations at which the occluding surfaces of the maxilla and the mandible posterior teeth meet. Occlusal contact detection is a vital tool for restoring the loss of masticatory function and is a mandatory assessment in the field of dentistry, with particular importance in prosthodontics and restorative dentistry. The most common method for occlusal contact detection is articulating paper. However, this method can indicate significant medically false positive and medically false negative contact areas, leaving the identification of true occlusal indications to clinicians. To address this, we propose a multiclass Vision Transformer and Fully Convolutional Network ensemble semantic segmentation model with a combination hierarchical loss function, which we name as Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Branch Transformer (H-FCBFormer). We also propose a method of generating medically true positive semantic segmentation masks derived from expert annotated articulating paper masks and gold standard masks. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning methods evaluated at detecting medically true positive contacts and performs better than dentists in terms of accurately identifying object-wise occlusal contact areas while taking significantly less time to identify them.

<p>Abstract: The aging population poses numerous challenges to healthcare, including the increase in chronic wounds in the elderly. The current approach to wound assessment by therapists based on photographic documentation is subjective, highlighting the need for computer-aided wound recognition from smartphone photos. This offers objective and convenient therapy monitoring, while being accessible to patients from their home at any time. However, despite research in mobile image segmentation, there is a lack of focus on mobile wound segmentation. To address this gap, we conduct initial research on three lightweight architectures to investigate their suitability for smartphone-based wound segmentation. Using public datasets and UNet as a baseline, our results are promising, with both ENet and TopFormer, as well as the larger UNeXt variant, showing comparable performance to UNet. Furthermore, we deploy the models into a smartphone app for visual assessment of live segmentation, where results demonstrate the effectiveness of TopFormer in distinguishing wounds from wound-coloured objects. While our study highlights the potential of transformer models for mobile wound segmentation, future work should aim to further improve the mask contours.</p>

<p>Abstract: Auto-regressive models have made significant progress in the realm of language generation, yet they do not perform on par with diffusion models in the domain of image synthesis. In this work, we introduce MARS, a novel framework for T2I generation that incorporates a specially designed Semantic Vision-Language Integration Expert (SemVIE). This innovative component integrates pre-trained LLMs by independently processing linguistic and visual information, freezing the textual component while fine-tuning the visual component. This methodology preserves the NLP capabilities of LLMs while imbuing them with exceptional visual understanding. Building upon the powerful base of the pre-trained Qwen-7B, MARS stands out with its bilingual generative capabilities corresponding to both English and Chinese language prompts and the capacity for joint image and text generation. The flexibility of this framework lends itself to migration towards any-to-any task adaptability. Furthermore, MARS employs a multi-stage training strategy that first establishes robust image-text alignment through complementary bidirectional tasks and subsequently concentrates on refining the T2I generation process, significantly augmenting text-image synchrony and the granularity of image details. Notably, MARS requires only 9% of the GPU days needed by SD1.5, yet it achieves remarkable results across a variety of benchmarks, illustrating the training efficiency and the potential for swift deployment in various applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring changes happening on Earth's surface and aiding in climate analysis, ecosystem assessment, and disaster response. In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with satellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection and semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves over the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and leverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases, models need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge. We investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global, multi-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the spatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of temporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on semantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving further attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Rahimi, Behrooz Razeghi, Sebastien Marcel</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the potential of image-to-image translation (I2I) techniques for transferring realism to 3D-rendered facial images in the context of Face Recognition (FR) systems. The primary motivation for using 3D-rendered facial images lies in their ability to circumvent the challenges associated with collecting large real face datasets for training FR systems. These images are generated entirely by 3D rendering engines, facilitating the generation of synthetic identities. However, it has been observed that FR systems trained on such synthetic datasets underperform when compared to those trained on real datasets, on various FR benchmarks. In this work, we demonstrate that by transferring the realism to 3D-rendered images (i.e., making the 3D-rendered images look more real), we can boost the performance of FR systems trained on these more photorealistic images. This improvement is evident when these systems are evaluated against FR benchmarks utilizing real-world data, thereby paving new pathways for employing synthetic data in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifang Zhang, Beibei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can learn high-quality representations from a large-scale training dataset of image-text pairs. Prompt learning is a popular approach to fine-tuning VLM to adapt them to downstream tasks. Despite the satisfying performance, a major limitation of prompt learning is the demand for labelled data. In real-world scenarios, we may only obtain candidate labels (where the true label is included) instead of the true labels due to data privacy or sensitivity issues. In this paper, we provide the first study on prompt learning with candidate labels for VLMs. We empirically demonstrate that prompt learning is more advantageous than other fine-tuning methods, for handling candidate labels. Nonetheless, its performance drops when the label ambiguity increases. In order to improve its robustness, we propose a simple yet effective framework that better leverages the prior knowledge of VLMs to guide the learning process with candidate labels. Specifically, our framework disambiguates candidate labels by aligning the model output with the mixed class posterior jointly predicted by both the learnable and the handcrafted prompt. Besides, our framework can be equipped with various off-the-shelf training objectives for learning with candidate labels to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanpu Li, Zeli Chen, Yiwen Zhang, Liming Zhong, Wei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image synthesis remains challenging due to misalignment noise during training. Existing methods have attempted to address this challenge by incorporating a registration-guided module. However, these methods tend to overlook the task-specific constraints on the synthetic and registration modules, which may cause the synthetic module to still generate spatially aligned images with misaligned target images during training, regardless of the registration module's function. Therefore, this paper proposes registration-guided consistency and incorporates disentanglement learning for medical image synthesis. The proposed registration-guided consistency architecture fosters task-specificity within the synthetic and registration modules by applying identical deformation fields before and after synthesis, while enforcing output consistency through an alignment loss. Moreover, the synthetic module is designed to possess the capability of disentangling anatomical structures and specific styles across various modalities. An anatomy consistency loss is introduced to further compel the synthetic module to preserve geometrical integrity within latent spaces. Experiments conducted on both an in-house abdominal CECT-CT dataset and a publicly available pelvic MR-CT dataset have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks compromise the integrity and reliability of machine learning models by embedding a hidden trigger during the training process, which can later be activated to cause unintended misbehavior. We propose a novel backdoor mitigation approach via machine unlearning to counter such backdoor attacks. The proposed method utilizes model activation of domain-equivalent unseen data to guide the editing of the model's weights. Unlike the previous unlearning-based mitigation methods, ours is computationally inexpensive and achieves state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a handful of unseen samples for unlearning. In addition, we also point out that unlearning the backdoor may cause the whole targeted class to be unlearned, thus introducing an additional repair step to preserve the model's utility after editing the model. Experiment results show that the proposed method is effective in unlearning the backdoor on different datasets and trigger patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present VEnhancer, a generative space-time enhancement framework that improves the existing text-to-video results by adding more details in spatial domain and synthetic detailed motion in temporal domain. Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos. Moreover, with VEnhancer, exisiting open-source state-of-the-art text-to-video method, VideoCrafter-2, reaches the top one in video generation benchmark -- VBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alleviating noisy pseudo labels remains a key challenge in Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL). Existing methods often filter pseudo labels based on strict conditions, but they typically assess classification and localization quality separately, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label ranking and selection. In particular, there might be inaccurate pseudo labels within selected positives, alongside reliable counterparts erroneously assigned to negatives. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning (APL) framework to facilitate better pseudo-label selection. Specifically, to improve the ranking quality, Adaptive Label Quality Assessment (ALQA) is proposed to jointly learn classification confidence and localization reliability, followed by dynamically selecting pseudo labels based on the joint score. Additionally, we propose an Instance-level Consistency Discriminator (ICD) for eliminating ambiguous positives and mining potential positives simultaneously based on inter-instance intrinsic consistency, thereby leading to a more precise selection. We further introduce a general unsupervised Action-aware Contrastive Pre-training (ACP) to enhance the discrimination both within actions and between actions and backgrounds, which benefits SS-TAL. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various semi-supervised settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a key method for 3D scene representation. With the rising prominence and influence of NeRF, safeguarding its intellectual property has become increasingly important. In this paper, we propose \textbf{NeRFProtector}, which adopts a plug-and-play strategy to protect NeRF's copyright during its creation. NeRFProtector utilizes a pre-trained watermarking base model, enabling NeRF creators to embed binary messages directly while creating their NeRF. Our plug-and-play property ensures NeRF creators can flexibly choose NeRF variants without excessive modifications. Leveraging our newly designed progressive distillation, we demonstrate performance on par with several leading-edge neural rendering methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\"org Gamerdinger, Sven Teufel, Stephan Amann, Georg Volk, Oliver Bringmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensive perception of the vehicle's environment and correct interpretation of the environment are crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. The perception of surrounding objects is the main component for further tasks such as trajectory planning. However, safe trajectory planning requires not only object detection, but also the detection of drivable areas and lane corridors. While first approaches consider an advanced safety evaluation of object detection, the evaluation of lane detection still lacks sufficient safety metrics. Similar to the safety metrics for object detection, additional factors such as the semantics of the scene with road type and road width, the detection range as well as the potential causes of missing detections, incorporated by vehicle speed, should be considered for the evaluation of lane detection. Therefore, we propose the Lane Safety Metric (LSM), which takes these factors into account and allows to evaluate the safety of lane detection systems by determining an easily interpretable safety score. We evaluate our offline safety metric on various virtual scenarios using different lane detection approaches and compare it with state-of-the-art performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li, Deshui Miao, Zhenyu He, Yaowei Wang, Huchuan Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking and segmenting multiple similar objects with complex or separate parts in long-term videos is inherently challenging due to the ambiguity of target parts and identity confusion caused by occlusion, background clutter, and long-term variations. In this paper, we propose a robust video object segmentation framework equipped with spatial-semantic features and discriminative object queries to address the above issues. Specifically, we construct a spatial-semantic network comprising a semantic embedding block and spatial dependencies modeling block to associate the pretrained ViT features with global semantic features and local spatial features, providing a comprehensive target representation. In addition, we develop a masked cross-attention module to generate object queries that focus on the most discriminative parts of target objects during query propagation, alleviating noise accumulation and ensuring effective long-term query propagation. The experimental results show that the proposed method set a new state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including the DAVIS2017 test (89.1%), YoutubeVOS 2019 (88.5%), MOSE (75.1%), LVOS test (73.0%), and LVOS val (75.1%), which demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of the proposed method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixiang Zhang, Haonan Wang, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle the challenges of time-consuming manual labeling in the medical field. However, in practical scenarios, there are often domain variations within the datasets, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We notice a critical shared challenge across three scenarios: the explicit semantic knowledge for segmentation performance and rich domain knowledge for generalizability exclusively exist in the labeled set and unlabeled set respectively. Such discrepancy hinders existing methods from effectively comprehending both types of knowledge under semi-supervised settings. To tackle this challenge, we develop a Semantic & Domain Knowledge Messenger (S&D Messenger) which facilitates direct knowledge delivery between the labeled and unlabeled set, and thus allowing the model to comprehend both of them in each individual learning flow. Equipped with our S&D Messenger, a naive pseudo-labeling method can achieve huge improvement on six benchmark datasets for SSMIS (+7.5%), UMDA (+5.6%), and Semi-MDG tasks (+1.14%), compared with state-of-the-art methods designed for specific tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07764">PosFormer: Recognizing Complex Handwritten Mathematical Expression with Position Forest Transformer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongkun Guan, Chengyu Lin, Wei Shen, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) has wide applications in human-machine interaction scenarios, such as digitized education and automated offices. Recently, sequence-based models with encoder-decoder architectures have been commonly adopted to address this task by directly predicting LaTeX sequences of expression images. However, these methods only implicitly learn the syntax rules provided by LaTeX, which may fail to describe the position and hierarchical relationship between symbols due to complex structural relations and diverse handwriting styles. To overcome this challenge, we propose a position forest transformer (PosFormer) for HMER, which jointly optimizes two tasks: expression recognition and position recognition, to explicitly enable position-aware symbol feature representation learning. Specifically, we first design a position forest that models the mathematical expression as a forest structure and parses the relative position relationships between symbols. Without requiring extra annotations, each symbol is assigned a position identifier in the forest to denote its relative spatial position. Second, we propose an implicit attention correction module to accurately capture attention for HMER in the sequence-based decoder architecture. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PosFormer, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods 2.03%/1.22%/2.00%, 1.83%, and 4.62% gains on the single-line CROHME 2014/2016/2019, multi-line M2E, and complex MNE datasets, respectively, with no additional latency or computational cost.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07780">Cross Domain Object Detection via Multi-Granularity Confidence Alignment based Mean Teacher</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangming Chen, Li Liu, Wanxia Deng, Zhen Liu, Yu Liu, Yingmei Wei, Yongxiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross domain object detection learns an object detector for an unlabeled target domain by transferring knowledge from an annotated source domain. Promising results have been achieved via Mean Teacher, however, pseudo labeling which is the bottleneck of mutual learning remains to be further explored. In this study, we find that confidence misalignment of the predictions, including category-level overconfidence, instance-level task confidence inconsistency, and image-level confidence misfocusing, leading to the injection of noisy pseudo label in the training process, will bring suboptimal performance on the target domain. To tackle this issue, we present a novel general framework termed Multi-Granularity Confidence Alignment Mean Teacher (MGCAMT) for cross domain object detection, which alleviates confidence misalignment across category-, instance-, and image-levels simultaneously to obtain high quality pseudo supervision for better teacher-student learning. Specifically, to align confidence with accuracy at category level, we propose Classification Confidence Alignment (CCA) to model category uncertainty based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) and filter out the category incorrect labels via an uncertainty-aware selection strategy. Furthermore, to mitigate the instance-level misalignment between classification and localization, we design Task Confidence Alignment (TCA) to enhance the interaction between the two task branches and allow each classification feature to adaptively locate the optimal feature for the regression. Finally, we develop imagery Focusing Confidence Alignment (FCA) adopting another way of pseudo label learning, i.e., we use the original outputs from the Mean Teacher network for supervised learning without label assignment to concentrate on holistic information in the target image. These three procedures benefit from each other from a cooperative learning perspective.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07789">Raising the Ceiling: Conflict-Free Local Feature Matching with Dynamic View Switching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyong Lu, Songlin Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Current feature matching methods prioritize improving modeling capabilities to better align outputs with ground-truth matches, which are the theoretical upper bound on matching results, metaphorically depicted as the "ceiling". However, these enhancements fail to address the underlying issues that directly hinder ground-truth matches, including the scarcity of matchable points in small scale images, matching conflicts in dense methods, and the keypoint-repeatability reliance in sparse methods. We propose a novel feature matching method named RCM, which Raises the Ceiling of Matching from three aspects. 1) RCM introduces a dynamic view switching mechanism to address the scarcity of matchable points in source images by strategically switching image pairs. 2) RCM proposes a conflict-free coarse matching module, addressing matching conflicts in the target image through a many-to-one matching strategy. 3) By integrating the semi-sparse paradigm and the coarse-to-fine architecture, RCM preserves the benefits of both high efficiency and global search, mitigating the reliance on keypoint repeatability. As a result, RCM enables more matchable points in the source image to be matched in an exhaustive and conflict-free manner in the target image, leading to a substantial 260% increase in ground-truth matches. Comprehensive experiments show that RCM exhibits remarkable performance and efficiency in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huafeng Qin, Xin Jin, Hongyu Zhu, Hongchao Liao, Moun\^im A. El-Yacoubi, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixup data augmentation approaches have been applied for various tasks of deep learning to improve the generalization ability of deep neural networks. Some existing approaches CutMix, SaliencyMix, etc. randomly replace a patch in one image with patches from another to generate the mixed image. Similarly, the corresponding labels are linearly combined by a fixed ratio $\lambda$ by l. The objects in two images may be overlapped during the mixing process, so some semantic information is corrupted in the mixed samples. In this case, the mixed image does not match the mixed label information. Besides, such a label may mislead the deep learning model training, which results in poor performance. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel approach named SUMix to learn the mixing ratio as well as the uncertainty for the mixed samples during the training process. First, we design a learnable similarity function to compute an accurate mix ratio. Second, an approach is investigated as a regularized term to model the uncertainty of the mixed samples. We conduct experiments on five image benchmarks, and extensive experimental results imply that our method is capable of improving the performance of classifiers with different cutting-based mixup approaches.

<p>Abstract: Stereo matching is close to hitting a half-century of history, yet witnessed a rapid evolution in the last decade thanks to deep learning. While previous surveys in the late 2010s covered the first stage of this revolution, the last five years of research brought further ground-breaking advancements to the field. This paper aims to fill this gap in a two-fold manner: first, we offer an in-depth examination of the latest developments in deep stereo matching, focusing on the pioneering architectural designs and groundbreaking paradigms that have redefined the field in the 2020s; second, we present a thorough analysis of the critical challenges that have emerged alongside these advances, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of these issues and exploring the state-of-the-art techniques proposed to address them. By reviewing both the architectural innovations and the key challenges, we offer a holistic view of deep stereo matching and highlight the specific areas that require further investigation. To accompany this survey, we maintain a regularly updated project page that catalogs papers on deep stereo matching in our Awesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching (https://github.com/fabiotosi92/Awesome-Deep-Stereo-Matching) repository.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated 3D city generation, focusing on road networks and building layouts, is in high demand for applications in urban design, multimedia games and autonomous driving simulations. The surge of generative AI facilitates designing city layouts based on deep learning models. However, the lack of high-quality datasets and benchmarks hinders the progress of these data-driven methods in generating road networks and building layouts. Furthermore, few studies consider urban characteristics, which generally take graphics as analysis objects and are crucial for practical applications, to control the generative process. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a multimodal dataset with accompanying evaluation metrics for controllable generation of Road networks and Building layouts (RoBus), which is the first and largest open-source dataset in city generation so far. RoBus dataset is formatted as images, graphics and texts, with $72,400$ paired samples that cover around $80,000km^2$ globally. We analyze the RoBus dataset statistically and validate the effectiveness against existing road networks and building layouts generation methods. Additionally, we design new baselines that incorporate urban characteristics, such as road orientation and building density, in the process of generating road networks and building layouts using the RoBus dataset, enhancing the practicality of automated urban design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Yang, Weixiang Yan, Aishwarya Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite tremendous advancements, current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are still far from perfect. They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose \textbf{De}compose and \textbf{C}ompare \textbf{C}onsistency (\texttt{DeCC}) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, \texttt{DeCC} measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show \texttt{DeCC}'s reliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared to the existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular self-supervised learning of foundation models (FMs), are revolutionizing medical imaging and computational pathology (CPath). A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected. These findings underscore the need for more adaptable and universally applicable aggregation techniques, guiding future research towards tools that better meet the evolving needs of clinical-AI in pathology.

To address this issue, we propose a novel ViT-based ReID framework in this paper, which fuses models trained on a variety of aspect ratios.

(ii) We introduce patch-wise mixup intra-image during ViT patchification (guided by spatial attention scores) and implement uneven stride for better object aspect ratio matching. (iii) We propose a dynamic feature fusing ReID network, enhancing model robustness. Our ReID method achieves a significantly improved mean Average Precision (mAP) of 91.0\% compared to the the closest state-of-the-art (CAL) result of 80.9\% on VehicleID dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary detection is a challenging task due to the requirement of detecting objects based on class names, including those not encountered during training. Existing methods have shown strong zero-shot detection capabilities through pre-training on diverse large-scale datasets. However, these approaches still face two primary challenges: (i) how to universally integrate diverse data sources for end-to-end training, and (ii) how to effectively leverage the language-aware capability for region-level cross-modality understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unified open-vocabulary detection method called OV-DINO, which pre-trains on diverse large-scale datasets with language-aware selective fusion in a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Data Integration (UniDI) pipeline to enable end-to-end training and eliminate noise from pseudo-label generation by unifying different data sources into detection-centric data. In addition, we propose a Language-Aware Selective Fusion (LASF) module to enable the language-aware ability of the model through a language-aware query selection and fusion process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed OV-DINO on popular open-vocabulary detection benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results with an AP of 50.6\% on the COCO dataset and 40.0\% on the LVIS dataset in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its strong generalization ability. Furthermore, the fine-tuned OV-DINO on COCO achieves 58.4\% AP, outperforming many existing methods with the same backbone.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, a resource-efficient implicit curriculum learning approach for dense prediction tasks. Our curriculum approach is defined by growing the patch size during model training, which gradually increases the task's difficulty. We integrated our curriculum into the nnU-Net framework and evaluated the methodology on all 10 tasks of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. With our approach, we are able to substantially reduce runtime, computational costs, and CO$_{2}$ emissions of network training compared to classical constant patch size training. In our experiments, the curriculum approach resulted in improved convergence. We are able to outperform standard nnU-Net training, which is trained with constant patch size, in terms of Dice Score on 7 out of 10 MSD tasks while only spending roughly 50\% of the original training runtime. To the best of our knowledge, our Progressive Growing of Patch Size is the first successful employment of a sample-length curriculum in the form of patch size in the field of computer vision.

<p>Abstract: We present 4DiM, a cascaded diffusion model for 4D novel view synthesis (NVS), conditioned on one or more images of a general scene, and a set of camera poses and timestamps. To overcome challenges due to limited availability of 4D training data, we advocate joint training on 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data and propose a new architecture that enables the same. We further advocate the calibration of SfM posed data using monocular metric depth estimators for metric scale camera control. For model evaluation, we introduce new metrics to enrich and overcome shortcomings of current evaluation schemes, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both fidelity and pose control compared to existing diffusion models for 3D NVS, while at the same time adding the ability to handle temporal dynamics. 4DiM is also used for improved panorama stitching, pose-conditioned video to video translation, and several other tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Li, Renrui Zhang, Hao Zhang, Yuanhan Zhang, Bo Li, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chunyuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning has made considerable strides in enhancing the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing open LMMs largely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-image scenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separately tackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize cross scenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduce LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame (video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. To enable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a general template and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4 primary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate the LLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performance of LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading results in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining the performance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits several emerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings and modalities. Code is available at https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhee Cho, Hyeonsu Lee, Seungdae Baek, Se-Bum Paik</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional intelligent systems based on deep neural network (DNN) models encounter challenges in achieving human-like continual learning due to catastrophic forgetting. Here, we propose a metaplasticity model inspired by human working memory, enabling DNNs to perform catastrophic forgetting-free continual learning without any pre- or post-processing. A key aspect of our approach involves implementing distinct types of synapses from stable to flexible, and randomly intermixing them to train synaptic connections with different degrees of flexibility. This strategy allowed the network to successfully learn a continuous stream of information, even under unexpected changes in input length. The model achieved a balanced tradeoff between memory capacity and performance without requiring additional training or structural modifications, dynamically allocating memory resources to retain both old and new information. Furthermore, the model demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks by selectively filtering out erroneous memories, leveraging the Hebb repetition effect to reinforce the retention of significant data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Novello, Yannick Prudent, Joseba Dalmau, Corentin Friedrich, Yann Pequignot</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the seminal paper of Hendrycks et al. arXiv:1610.02136, Post-hoc deep Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has expanded rapidly. As a result, practitioners working on safety-critical applications and seeking to improve the robustness of a neural network now have a plethora of methods to choose from. However, no method outperforms every other on every dataset arXiv:2210.07242, so the current best practice is to test all the methods on the datasets at hand. This paper shifts focus from developing new methods to effectively combining existing ones to enhance OOD detection. We propose and compare four different strategies for integrating multiple detection scores into a unified OOD detector, based on techniques such as majority vote, empirical and copulas-based Cumulative Distribution Function modeling, and multivariate quantiles based on optimal transport. We extend common OOD evaluation metrics -- like AUROC and FPR at fixed TPR rates -- to these multi-dimensional OOD detectors, allowing us to evaluate them and compare them with individual methods on extensive benchmarks. Furthermore, we propose a series of guidelines to choose what OOD detectors to combine in more realistic settings, i.e. in the absence of known OOD data, relying on principles drawn from Outlier Exposure arXiv:1812.04606.

<p>Abstract: The accurate evaluation of left atrial fibrosis via high-quality 3D Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) MRI is crucial for atrial fibrillation management but is hindered by factors like patient movement and imaging variability. The pursuit of automated LGE MRI quality assessment is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, standardizing evaluations, and improving patient outcomes. The deep learning models aimed at automating this process face significant challenges due to the scarcity of expert annotations, high computational costs, and the need to capture subtle diagnostic details in highly variable images. This study introduces HAMIL-QA, a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, designed to overcome these obstacles. HAMIL-QA employs a hierarchical bag and sub-bag structure that allows for targeted analysis within sub-bags and aggregates insights at the volume level. This hierarchical MIL approach reduces reliance on extensive annotations, lessens computational load, and ensures clinically relevant quality predictions by focusing on diagnostically critical image features. Our experiments show that HAMIL-QA surpasses existing MIL methods and traditional supervised approaches in accuracy, AUROC, and F1-Score on an LGE MRI scan dataset, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution for LGE MRI quality assessment automation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian-Qing Zheng, Yuanhan Mo, Yang Sun, Jiahua Li, Fuping Wu, Ziyang Wang, Tonia Vincent, Bart{\l}omiej W. Papie\.z</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential in synthetic image generation tasks. However, these models often struggle with the interpretable connections between the generated and existing images and could create illusions. To address these challenges, our research proposes a novel diffusion-based generative model based on deformation diffusion and recovery. This model, named Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), diverges from traditional score/intensity and latent feature-based approaches, emphasizing morphological changes through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. This is achieved by introducing a topological-preserving deformation field generation method, which randomly samples and integrates a set of multi-scale Deformation Vector Fields (DVF). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unreasonable deformation components, thereby restoring each randomly deformed image to a realistic distribution. These innovations facilitate the generation of diverse and anatomically plausible deformations, enhancing data augmentation and synthesis for further analysis in downstream tasks, such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experimental results in cardiac MRI and pulmonary CT show DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large (over 10% image size deformation scale), and high-quality (negative ratio of folding rate is lower than 1%) deformation fields. The further experimental results in downstream tasks, 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration, indicate significant improvements resulting from DRDM, showcasing the potential of our model to advance image manipulation and synthesis in medical imaging and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Praveenbalaji Rajendran, Yong Yang, Thomas R. Niedermayr, Michael Gensheimer, Beth Beadle, Quynh-Thu Le, Lei Xing, Xianjin Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most effective treatments for cancer, and its success relies on the accurate delineation of targets. However, target delineation is a comprehensive medical decision that currently relies purely on manual processes by human experts. Manual delineation is time-consuming, laborious, and subject to interobserver variations. Although the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significantly enhanced the auto-contouring of normal tissues, accurate delineation of RT target volumes remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a visual language model-based RT target volume auto-delineation network termed Radformer. The Radformer utilizes a hierarichal vision transformer as the backbone and incorporates large language models to extract text-rich features from clinical data. We introduce a visual language attention module (VLAM) for integrating visual and linguistic features for language-aware visual encoding (LAVE). The Radformer has been evaluated on a dataset comprising 2985 patients with head-and-neck cancer who underwent RT. Metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IOU), and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), were used to evaluate the performance of the model quantitatively. Our results demonstrate that the Radformer has superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art models, validating its potential for adoption in RT practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard single-image super-resolution creates paired training data from high-resolution images through fixed downsampling kernels. However, real-world super-resolution (RWSR) faces unknown degradations in the low-resolution inputs, all the while lacking paired training data. Existing methods approach this problem by learning blind general models through complex synthetic augmentations on training inputs; they sacrifice the performance on specific degradation for broader generalization to many possible ones. We address the unsupervised RWSR for a targeted real-world degradation. We study from a distillation perspective and introduce a novel pairwise distance distillation framework. Through our framework, a model specialized in synthetic degradation adapts to target real-world degradations by distilling intra- and inter-model distances across the specialized model and an auxiliary generalized model. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances fidelity and perceptual quality, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in RWSR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luoxiao Yang, Yun Wang, Xinqi Fan, Israel Cohen, Yue Zhao, Zijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

<p>Abstract: Contrast-enhanced brain MRI (CE-MRI) is a valuable diagnostic technique but may pose health risks and incur high costs. To create safer alternatives, multi-modality medical image translation aims to synthesize CE-MRI images from other available modalities. Although existing methods can generate promising predictions, they still face two challenges, i.e., exhibiting over-confidence and lacking interpretability on predictions. To address the above challenges, this paper introduces TrustI2I, a novel trustworthy method that reformulates multi-to-one medical image translation problem as a multimodal regression problem, aiming to build an uncertainty-aware and reliable system. Specifically, our method leverages deep evidential regression to estimate prediction uncertainties and employs an explicit intermediate and late fusion strategy based on the Mixture of Normal Inverse Gamma (MoNIG) distribution, enhancing both synthesis quality and interpretability. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty calibration to improve the reliability of uncertainty. Validation on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrates that our approach surpasses current methods, producing higher-quality images with rational uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on the unprecedented capabilities of large language models for command understanding and zero-shot recognition of multi-modal vision-language transformers, visual language navigation (VLN) has emerged as an effective way to address multiple fundamental challenges toward a natural language interface to robot navigation. However, such vision-language models are inherently vulnerable due to the lack of semantic meaning of the underlying embedding space. Using a recently developed gradient based optimization procedure, we demonstrate that images can be modified imperceptibly to match the representation of totally different images and unrelated texts for a vision-language model. Building on this, we develop algorithms that can adversarially modify a minimal number of images so that the robot will follow a route of choice for commands that require a number of landmarks. We demonstrate that experimentally using a recently proposed VLN system; for a given navigation command, a robot can be made to follow drastically different routes. We also develop an efficient algorithm to detect such malicious modifications reliably based on the fact that the adversarially modified images have much higher sensitivity to added Gaussian noise than the original images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfang Guo, Yuting Wu, Yimin Dai, Pengfei Zhou, Xin Lou, Rui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera-based computer vision is essential to autonomous vehicle's perception. This paper presents an attack that uses light-emitting diodes and exploits the camera's rolling shutter effect to create adversarial stripes in the captured images to mislead traffic sign recognition. The attack is stealthy because the stripes on the traffic sign are invisible to human. For the attack to be threatening, the recognition results need to be stable over consecutive image frames. To achieve this, we design and implement GhostStripe, an attack system that controls the timing of the modulated light emission to adapt to camera operations and victim vehicle movements. Evaluated on real testbeds, GhostStripe can stably spoof the traffic sign recognition results for up to 94\% of frames to a wrong class when the victim vehicle passes the road section. In reality, such attack effect may fool victim vehicles into life-threatening incidents. We discuss the countermeasures at the levels of camera sensor, perception model, and autonomous driving system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly enhanced medical image segmentation by facilitating the learning of global relationships. However, these methods face a notable challenge in capturing diverse local and global long-range sequential feature representations, particularly evident in whole-body CT (WBCT) scans. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Swin Soft Mixture Transformer (Swin SMT), a novel architecture based on Swin UNETR. This model incorporates a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (Soft MoE) to effectively handle complex and diverse long-range dependencies. The use of Soft MoE allows for scaling up model parameters maintaining a balance between computational complexity and segmentation performance in both training and inference modes. We evaluate Swin SMT on the publicly available TotalSegmentator-V2 dataset, which includes 117 major anatomical structures in WBCT images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that Swin SMT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in 3D anatomical structure segmentation, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient of 85.09%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar S. EL-Assiouti, Ghada Hamed, Dina Khattab, Hala M. Ebied</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved significant advancement in computer vision tasks due to their powerful modeling capacity. However, their performance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of inherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous approaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some focused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT student, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate features due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated feature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced alignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to mismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end, this paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD) paradigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid student serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both convolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with the teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application of feature distillation without any information loss or additional computational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight convolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which serves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models. Extensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority of HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Reducing scan time in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging while maintaining high-quality images is crucial for minimizing patient discomfort and radiation exposure. Due to the limited size of datasets and distribution discrepancy across scanners in medical imaging, fine-tuning in a parameter-efficient and effective manner is on the rise. Motivated by the potential of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), we aim to address these issues by effectively leveraging PEFT to improve limited data and GPU resource issues in multi-scanner setups. In this paper, we introduce PETITE, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for MultI-scanner PET to PET REconstruction that uses fewer than 1% of the parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically explore the efficacy of diverse PEFT techniques in medical imaging reconstruction tasks via prevalent encoder-decoder-type deep models. This investigation, in particular, brings intriguing insights into PETITE as we show further improvements by treating encoder and decoder separately and mixing different PEFT methods, namely, Mix-PEFT. Using multi-scanner PET datasets comprised of five different scanners, we extensively test the cross-scanner PET scan time reduction performances (i.e., a model pre-trained on one scanner is fine-tuned on a different scanner) of 21 feasible Mix-PEFT combinations to derive optimal PETITE. We show that training with less than 1% parameters using PETITE performs on par with full fine-tuning (i.e., 100% parameter)</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jannis Ahlert, Thomas Klein, Felix Wichmann, Robert Geirhos</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, various methods and benchmarks have been proposed to empirically evaluate the alignment of artificial neural networks to human neural and behavioral data. But how aligned are different alignment metrics? To answer this question, we analyze visual data from Brain-Score (Schrimpf et al., 2018), including metrics from the model-vs-human toolbox (Geirhos et al., 2021), together with human feature alignment (Linsley et al., 2018; Fel et al., 2022) and human similarity judgements (Muttenthaler et al., 2022). We find that pairwise correlations between neural scores and behavioral scores are quite low and sometimes even negative. For instance, the average correlation between those 80 models on Brain-Score that were fully evaluated on all 69 alignment metrics we considered is only 0.198. Assuming that all of the employed metrics are sound, this implies that alignment with human perception may best be thought of as a multidimensional concept, with different methods measuring fundamentally different aspects. Our results underline the importance of integrative benchmarking, but also raise questions about how to correctly combine and aggregate individual metrics. Aggregating by taking the arithmetic average, as done in Brain-Score, leads to the overall performance currently being dominated by behavior (95.25% explained variance) while the neural predictivity plays a less important role (only 33.33% explained variance). As a first step towards making sure that different alignment metrics all contribute fairly towards an integrative benchmark score, we therefore conclude by comparing three different aggregation options.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is the process of removing the impact of a particular set of training samples from a pretrained model. It aims to fulfill the "right to be forgotten", which grants the individuals such as patients the right to reconsider their contribution in models including medical imaging models. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness (performance) and computational efficiency of different unlearning algorithms in medical imaging domain. Our evaluations demonstrate that the considered unlearning algorithms perform well on the retain set (samples whose influence on the model is allowed to be retained) and forget set (samples whose contribution to the model should be eliminated), and show no bias against male or female samples. They, however, adversely impact the generalization of the model, especially for larger forget set sizes. Moreover, they might be biased against easy or hard samples, and need additional computational overhead for hyper-parameter tuning. In conclusion, machine unlearning seems promising for medical imaging, but the existing unlearning algorithms still needs further improvements to become more practical for medical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often involve inherent challenges such as partially labeled datasets, where not all clients possess expert annotations of all labels of interest, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. In this study, we conduct the largest federated cardiac CT imaging analysis to date, focusing on partially labeled datasets ($n=8,124$) of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) patients over eight hospital clients. Transformer architectures, which are the major building blocks of current foundation models, have shown superior performance when trained on larger cohorts than traditional CNNs. However, when trained on small task-specific labeled sample sizes, it is currently not feasible to exploit their underlying attention mechanism for improved performance. Therefore, we developed a two-stage semi-supervised learning strategy that distills knowledge from several task-specific CNNs (landmark detection and segmentation of calcification) into a single transformer model by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data typically residing unused in hospitals to mitigate these issues. This method not only improves the predictive accuracy and generalizability of transformer-based architectures but also facilitates the simultaneous learning of all partial labels within a single transformer model across the federation. Additionally, we show that our transformer-based model extracts more meaningful features for further downstream tasks than the UNet-based one by only training the last layer to also solve segmentation of coronary arteries. We make the code and weights of the final model openly available, which can serve as a foundation model for further research in cardiac CT imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumayya Inayat, Nimra Dilawar, Waqas Sultani, Mohsen Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, numerous domain adaptive strategies have been proposed to help deep learning models overcome the challenges posed by domain shift. However, even unsupervised domain adaptive strategies still require a large amount of target data. Medical imaging datasets are often characterized by class imbalance and scarcity of labeled and unlabeled data. Few-shot domain adaptive object detection (FSDAOD) addresses the challenge of adapting object detectors to target domains with limited labeled data. Existing works struggle with randomly selected target domain images that may not accurately represent the real population, resulting in overfitting to small validation sets and poor generalization to larger test sets. Medical datasets exhibit high class imbalance and background similarity, leading to increased false positives and lower mean Average Precision (map) in target domains. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel FSDAOD strategy for microscopic imaging. Our contributions include a domain adaptive class balancing strategy for few-shot scenarios, multi-layer instance-level inter and intra-domain alignment to enhance similarity between class instances regardless of domain, and an instance-level classification loss applied in the middle layers of the object detector to enforce feature retention necessary for correct classification across domains. Extensive experimental results with competitive baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on two public microscopic datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Lindstr\"om, Borja Rodr\'iguez-G\'alvez, Ragnar Thobaben, Mikael Skoglund</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis can predict the risk of malignant disease transformation, thereby increasing the probability of effective treatment. A mild syndrome with small infected regions is an ominous warning and is foremost in the early diagnosis of diseases. Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used to segment natural or medical objects, showing promising results. However, analyzing medical objects of small areas in images remains a challenge due to information losses and compression defects caused by convolution and pooling operations in CNNs. These losses and defects become increasingly significant as the network deepens, particularly for small medical objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel scale-variant attention-based network (SvANet) for accurate small-scale object segmentation in medical images. The SvANet consists of Monte Carlo attention, scale-variant attention, and vision transformer, which incorporates cross-scale features and alleviates compression artifacts for enhancing the discrimination of small medical objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SvANet, achieving 96.12%, 96.11%, 89.79%, 84.15%, 80.25%, 73.05%, and 72.58% in mean Dice coefficient for segmenting kidney tumors, skin lesions, hepatic tumors, polyps, surgical excision cells, retinal vasculatures, and sperms, which occupy less than 1% of the image areas in KiTS23, ISIC 2018, ATLAS, PolypGen, TissueNet, FIVES, and SpermHealth datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romy Williamson, Niloy J. Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups. Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry. However, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation (a spherical parametrization) for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation. Namely, we show how to construct the normals and the first and second fundamental forms of the surface, and how to compute the surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface. These operators, in turn, enable us to create geometry processing tools that act directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and our method shows robustness to isometric shape variations. We both propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates. By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of the Internet has profoundly changed human life. Humans are increasingly expressing themselves and interacting with others on social media platforms. However, although artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in many aspects of life, its application in social media content creation is still blank. To solve this problem, we propose a new prompt word generation framework based on multi-modal information fusion, which combines multiple tasks including topic classification, sentiment analysis, scene recognition and keyword extraction to generate more comprehensive prompt words. Subsequently, we use a template containing a set of prompt words to guide ChatGPT to generate high-quality tweets. Furthermore, in the absence of effective and objective evaluation criteria in the field of content generation, we use the ChatGPT tool to evaluate the results generated by the algorithm, making large-scale evaluation of content generation algorithms possible. Evaluation results on extensive content generation demonstrate that our cue word generation framework generates higher quality content compared to manual methods and other cueing techniques, while topic classification, sentiment analysis, and scene recognition significantly enhance content clarity and its consistency with the image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younggyo Seo, Jafar Uru\c{c}, Stephen James</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in improving the sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, designing an RL algorithm that can be practically deployed in real-world environments remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Coarse-to-fine Reinforcement Learning (CRL), a framework that trains RL agents to zoom-into a continuous action space in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling the use of stable, sample-efficient value-based RL algorithms for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Our key idea is to train agents that output actions by iterating the procedure of (i) discretizing the continuous action space into multiple intervals and (ii) selecting the interval with the highest Q-value to further discretize at the next level. We then introduce a concrete, value-based algorithm within the CRL framework called Coarse-to-fine Q-Network (CQN). Our experiments demonstrate that CQN significantly outperforms RL and behavior cloning baselines on 20 sparsely-rewarded RLBench manipulation tasks with a modest number of environment interactions and expert demonstrations. We also show that CQN robustly learns to solve real-world manipulation tasks within a few minutes of online training.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we aim to generate clean speech frame by frame from a live video stream and a noisy audio stream without relying on future inputs. To this end, we propose RT-LA-VocE, which completely re-designs every component of LA-VocE, a state-of-the-art non-causal audio-visual speech enhancement model, to perform causal real-time inference with a 40ms input frame. We do so by devising new visual and audio encoders that rely solely on past frames, replacing the Transformer encoder with the Emformer, and designing a new causal neural vocoder C-HiFi-GAN. On the popular AVSpeech dataset, we show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in all real-time scenarios. More importantly, each component is carefully tuned to minimize the algorithm latency to the theoretical minimum (40ms) while maintaining a low end-to-end processing latency of 28.15ms per frame, enabling real-time frame-by-frame enhancement with minimal delay.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Th\'eo Uscidda, Luca Eyring, Karsten Roth, Fabian Theis, Zeynep Akata, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in an unsupervised manner is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. While remarkably difficult to solve in general, recent works have shown that disentanglement is provably achievable under additional assumptions that can leverage geometrical constraints, such as local isometry. To use these insights, we propose a novel perspective on disentangled representation learning built on quadratic optimal transport. Specifically, we formulate the problem in the Gromov-Monge setting, which seeks isometric mappings between distributions supported on different spaces. We propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer that quantifies the geometry-preservation of an arbitrary push-forward map between two distributions supported on different spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GMG regularization for disentanglement on four standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show that geometry preservation can even encourage unsupervised disentanglement without the standard reconstruction objective - making the underlying model decoder-free, and promising a more practically viable and scalable perspective on unsupervised disentanglement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eugene Teoh, Sumit Patidar, Xiao Ma, Stephen James</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalising vision-based manipulation policies to novel environments remains a challenging area with limited exploration. Current practices involve collecting data in one location, training imitation learning or reinforcement learning policies with this data, and deploying the policy in the same location. However, this approach lacks scalability as it necessitates data collection in multiple locations for each task. This paper proposes a novel approach where data is collected in a location predominantly featuring green screens. We introduce Green-screen Augmentation (GreenAug), employing a chroma key algorithm to overlay background textures onto a green screen. Through extensive real-world empirical studies with over 850 training demonstrations and 8.2k evaluation episodes, we demonstrate that GreenAug surpasses no augmentation, standard computer vision augmentation, and prior generative augmentation methods in performance. While no algorithmic novelties are claimed, our paper advocates for a fundamental shift in data collection practices. We propose that real-world demonstrations in future research should utilise green screens, followed by the application of GreenAug. We believe GreenAug unlocks policy generalisation to visually distinct novel locations, addressing the current scene generalisation limitations in robot learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image-generation diffusion models have been fine-tuned to unlock new capabilities such as image-editing and novel view synthesis. Can we similarly unlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, a behavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions' as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method is also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth, keypoints, or motion-planners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifeng Zhang, Baoyu Li, Kris Hauser, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive models are a crucial component of many robotic systems. Yet, constructing accurate predictive models for a variety of deformable objects, especially those with unknown physical properties, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces AdaptiGraph, a learning-based dynamics modeling approach that enables robots to predict, adapt to, and control a wide array of challenging deformable materials with unknown physical properties. AdaptiGraph leverages the highly flexible graph-based neural dynamics (GBND) framework, which represents material bits as particles and employs a graph neural network (GNN) to predict particle motion. Its key innovation is a unified physical property-conditioned GBND model capable of predicting the motions of diverse materials with varying physical properties without retraining. Upon encountering new materials during online deployment, AdaptiGraph utilizes a physical property optimization process for a few-shot adaptation of the model, enhancing its fit to the observed interaction data. The adapted models can precisely simulate the dynamics and predict the motion of various deformable materials, such as ropes, granular media, rigid boxes, and cloth, while adapting to different physical properties, including stiffness, granular size, and center of pressure. On prediction and manipulation tasks involving a diverse set of real-world deformable objects, our method exhibits superior prediction accuracy and task proficiency over non-material-conditioned and non-adaptive models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyu Guo, Dingwen Zhang, Longfei Han, Nian Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Junwei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous knowledge distillation (KD) methods mostly focus on compressing network architectures, which is not thorough enough in deployment as some costs like transmission bandwidth and imaging equipment are related to the image size. Therefore, we propose Pixel Distillation that extends knowledge distillation into the input level while simultaneously breaking architecture constraints. Such a scheme can achieve flexible cost control for deployment, as it allows the system to adjust both network architecture and image quality according to the overall requirement of resources. Specifically, we first propose an input spatial representation distillation (ISRD) mechanism to transfer spatial knowledge from large images to student's input module, which can facilitate stable knowledge transfer between CNN and ViT. Then, a Teacher-Assistant-Student (TAS) framework is further established to disentangle pixel distillation into the model compression stage and input compression stage, which significantly reduces the overall complexity of pixel distillation and the difficulty of distilling intermediate knowledge. Finally, we adapt pixel distillation to object detection via an aligned feature for preservation (AFP) strategy for TAS, which aligns output dimensions of detectors at each stage by manipulating features and anchors of the assistant. Comprehensive experiments on image classification and object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/gyguo/PixelDistillation.</p>

To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chen, Zuxuan Wu, Xintong Han, Menglin Jia, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current research on continual learning mainly focuses on relieving catastrophic forgetting, and most of their success is at the cost of limiting the performance of newly incoming tasks. Such a trade-off is referred to as the stability-plasticity dilemma and is a more general and challenging problem for continual learning. However, the inherent conflict between these two concepts makes it seemingly impossible to devise a satisfactory solution to both of them simultaneously. Therefore, we ask, "is it possible to divide them into two separate problems to conquer them independently?". To this end, we propose a prompt-tuning-based method termed PromptFusion to enable the decoupling of stability and plasticity. Specifically, PromptFusion consists of a carefully designed \stab module that deals with catastrophic forgetting and a \boo module to learn new knowledge concurrently. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead brought by the additional architecture, we propose PromptFusion-Lite which improves PromptFusion by dynamically determining whether to activate both modules for each input image. Extensive experiments show that both PromptFusion and PromptFusion-Lite achieve promising results on popular continual learning datasets for class-incremental and domain-incremental settings. Especially on Split-Imagenet-R, one of the most challenging datasets for class-incremental learning, our method can exceed state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by more than 5\% in accuracy, with PromptFusion-Lite using 14.8\% less computational resources than PromptFusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a topological mapping and localization system able to operate on real human colonoscopies, despite significant shape and illumination changes. The map is a graph where each node codes a colon location by a set of real images, while edges represent traversability between nodes. For close-in-time images, where scene changes are minor, place recognition can be successfully managed with the recent transformers-based local feature matching algorithms. However, under long-term changes -- such as different colonoscopies of the same patient -- feature-based matching fails. To address this, we train on real colonoscopies a deep global descriptor achieving high recall with significant changes in the scene. The addition of a Bayesian filter boosts the accuracy of long-term place recognition, enabling relocalization in a previously built map. Our experiments show that ColonMapper is able to autonomously build a map and localize against it in two important use cases: localization within the same colonoscopy or within different colonoscopies of the same patient.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Bao, Lichang Chen, Heng Huang, Yu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task aims to recognize unseen compositional visual concepts, e.g., sliced tomatoes, where the model is learned only from the seen compositions, e.g., sliced potatoes and red tomatoes. Thanks to the prompt tuning on large pre-trained visual language models such as CLIP, recent literature shows impressively better CZSL performance than traditional vision-based methods. However, the key aspects that impact the generalization to unseen compositions, including the diversity and informativeness of class context, and the entanglement between visual primitives, i.e., state and object, are not properly addressed in existing CLIP-based CZSL literature. In this paper, we propose a model by prompting the language-informed distribution, aka., PLID, for the CZSL task. Specifically, the PLID leverages pre-trained large language models (LLM) to (i) formulate the language-informed class distributions which are diverse and informative, and (ii) enhance the compositionality of the class embedding. Moreover, a visual-language primitive decomposition (VLPD) module is proposed to dynamically fuse the classification decisions from the compositional and the primitive space. Orthogonal to the existing literature of soft, hard, or distributional prompts, our method advocates prompting the LLM-supported class distributions, leading to a better zero-shot generalization. Experimental results on MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA datasets show the superior performance of the PLID to the prior arts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Piotr Koniusz, Tom Gedeon, Liang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrastive learning, two views of an original image, generated by different augmentations, are considered a positive pair, and their similarity is required to be high. Similarly, two views of distinct images form a negative pair, with encouraged low similarity. Typically, a single similarity measure, provided by a lone projection head, evaluates positive and negative sample pairs. However, due to diverse augmentation strategies and varying intra-sample similarity, views from the same image may not always be similar. Additionally, owing to inter-sample similarity, views from different images may be more akin than those from the same image. Consequently, enforcing high similarity for positive pairs and low similarity for negative pairs may be unattainable, and in some cases, such enforcement could detrimentally impact performance. To address this challenge, we propose using multiple projection heads, each producing a distinct set of features. Our pre-training loss function emerges from a solution to the maximum likelihood estimation over head-wise posterior distributions of positive samples given observations. This loss incorporates the similarity measure over positive and negative pairs, each re-weighted by an individual adaptive temperature, regulated to prevent ill solutions. Our approach, Adaptive Multi-Head Contrastive Learning (AMCL), can be applied to and experimentally enhances several popular contrastive learning methods such as SimCLR, MoCo, and Barlow Twins. The improvement remains consistent across various backbones and linear probing epochs, and becomes more significant when employing multiple augmentation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matic Fu\v{c}ka, Vitjan Zavrtanik, Danijel Sko\v{c}aj</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is a vital component in manufacturing inspection. Current discriminative methods follow a two-stage architecture composed of a reconstructive network followed by a discriminative network that relies on the reconstruction output. Currently used reconstructive networks often produce poor reconstructions that either still contain anomalies or lack details in anomaly-free regions. Discriminative methods are robust to some reconstructive network failures, suggesting that the discriminative network learns a strong normal appearance signal that the reconstructive networks miss. We reformulate the two-stage architecture into a single-stage iterative process that allows the exchange of information between the reconstruction and localization. We propose a novel transparency-based diffusion process where the transparency of anomalous regions is progressively increased, restoring their normal appearance accurately while maintaining the appearance of anomaly-free regions using localization cues of previous steps. We implement the proposed process as TRANSparency DifFUSION (TransFusion), a novel discriminative anomaly detection method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the VisA and the MVTec AD datasets, with an image-level AUROC of 98.5% and 99.2%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haidong Zhu, Tianyu Ding, Tianyi Chen, Ilya Zharkov, Ram Nevatia, Luming Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizability and few-shot learning are key challenges in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), often due to the lack of a holistic understanding in pixel-level rendering. We introduce CaesarNeRF, an end-to-end approach that leverages scene-level CAlibratEd SemAntic Representation along with pixel-level representations to advance few-shot, generalizable neural rendering, facilitating a holistic understanding without compromising high-quality details. CaesarNeRF explicitly models pose differences of reference views to combine scene-level semantic representations, providing a calibrated holistic understanding. This calibration process aligns various viewpoints with precise location and is further enhanced by sequential refinement to capture varying details. Extensive experiments on public datasets, including LLFF, Shiny, mip-NeRF 360, and MVImgNet, show that CaesarNeRF delivers state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of reference views, proving effective even with a single reference image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Ge, Sanjay Subramanian, Baifeng Shi, Roei Herzig, Trevor Darrell</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Programming (VP) has emerged as a powerful framework for Visual Question Answering (VQA). By generating and executing bespoke code for each question, these methods demonstrate impressive compositional and reasoning capabilities, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. However, existing VP methods generate all code in a single function, resulting in code that is suboptimal in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. Inspired by human coding practices, we propose Recursive Visual Programming (RVP), which simplifies generated routines, provides more efficient problem solving, and can manage more complex data structures. RVP is inspired by human coding practices and approaches VQA tasks with an iterative recursive code generation approach, allowing decomposition of complicated problems into smaller parts. Notably, RVP is capable of dynamic type assignment, i.e., as the system recursively generates a new piece of code, it autonomously determines the appropriate return type and crafts the requisite code to generate that output. We show RVP's efficacy through extensive experiments on benchmarks including VSR, COVR, GQA, and NextQA, underscoring the value of adopting human-like recursive and modular programming techniques for solving VQA tasks through coding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart Brocki, Jakub Binda, Neo Christopher Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Importance estimators are explainability methods that quantify feature importance for deep neural networks (DNN). In vision transformers (ViT), the self-attention mechanism naturally leads to attention maps, which are sometimes used as importance scores for which input features ViT models are focusing on. However, attention maps do not account for signals from downstream tasks. To generate explanations that are sensitive to downstream tasks, we have developed class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM), a gradient-based extension that estimates feature importance with respect to a known class or a latent concept. CDAM scales attention scores by how relevant the corresponding tokens are for the predictions of a classifier head. In addition to targeting the supervised classifier, CDAM can explain an arbitrary concept shared by selected samples by measuring similarity in the latent space of ViT. Additionally, we introduce Smooth CDAM and Integrated CDAM, which average a series of CDAMs with slightly altered tokens. Our quantitative benchmarks include correctness, compactness, and class sensitivity, in comparison to six other importance estimators. Vanilla, Smooth, and Integrated CDAM excel across all three benchmarks. In particular, our results suggest that existing importance estimators may not provide sufficient class-sensitivity. We demonstrate the utility of CDAM in medical images by training and explaining malignancy and biomarker prediction models based on lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Overall, CDAM is shown to be highly class-discriminative and semantically relevant, while providing compact explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixin Zhang, Yiyuan Zhang, Xiaohan Ding, Fusheng Jin, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: The construction of online vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps is critical for downstream prediction and planning. Recent efforts have built strong baselines for this task, however, shapes and relations of instances in urban road systems are still under-explored, such as parallelism, perpendicular, or rectangle-shape. In our work, we propose GeMap ($\textbf{Ge}$ometry $\textbf{Map}$), which end-to-end learns Euclidean shapes and relations of map instances beyond basic perception. Specifically, we design a geometric loss based on angle and distance clues, which is robust to rigid transformations. We also decouple self-attention to independently handle Euclidean shapes and relations. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the NuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets. Remarkably, it reaches a 71.8% mAP on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset, outperforming MapTR V2 by +4.4% and surpassing the 70% mAP threshold for the first time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongkun Guan, Wei Shen, Xue Yang, Xuehui Wang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing scene text detection methods typically rely on extensive real data for training. Due to the lack of annotated real images, recent works have attempted to exploit large-scale labeled synthetic data (LSD) for pre-training text detectors. However, a synth-to-real domain gap emerges, further limiting the performance of text detectors. Differently, in this work, we propose FreeReal, a real-domain-aligned pre-training paradigm that enables the complementary strengths of both LSD and unlabeled real data (URD). Specifically, to bridge real and synthetic worlds for pre-training, a glyph-based mixing mechanism (GlyphMix) is tailored for text images.GlyphMix delineates the character structures of synthetic images and embeds them as graffiti-like units onto real images. Without introducing real domain drift, GlyphMix freely yields real-world images with annotations derived from synthetic labels. Furthermore, when given free fine-grained synthetic labels, GlyphMix can effectively bridge the linguistic domain gap stemming from English-dominated LSD to URD in various languages. Without bells and whistles, FreeReal achieves average gains of 1.97%, 3.90%, 3.85%, and 4.56% in improving the performance of FCENet, PSENet, PANet, and DBNet methods, respectively, consistently outperforming previous pre-training methods by a substantial margin across four public datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyun Shen, Wenhao Li, Haoqing Chen, Xiaoling Wang, Fengping Zhu, Yuxin Li, Xiangfeng Wang, Bo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiologists must utilize multiple modal images for tumor segmentation and diagnosis due to the limitations of medical imaging and the diversity of tumor signals. This leads to the development of multimodal learning in segmentation. However, the redundancy among modalities creates challenges for existing subtraction-based joint learning methods, such as misjudging the importance of modalities, ignoring specific modal information, and increasing cognitive load. These thorny issues ultimately decrease segmentation accuracy and increase the risk of overfitting. This paper presents the complementary information mutual learning (CIML) framework, which can mathematically model and address the negative impact of inter-modal redundant information. CIML adopts the idea of addition and removes inter-modal redundant information through inductive bias-driven task decomposition and message passing-based redundancy filtering. CIML first decomposes the multimodal segmentation task into multiple subtasks based on expert prior knowledge, minimizing the information dependence between modalities. Furthermore, CIML introduces a scheme in which each modality can extract information from other modalities additively through message passing. To achieve non-redundancy of extracted information, the redundant filtering is transformed into complementary information learning inspired by the variational information bottleneck. The complementary information learning procedure can be efficiently solved by variational inference and cross-modal spatial attention. Numerical results from the verification task and standard benchmarks indicate that CIML efficiently removes redundant information between modalities, outperforming SOTA methods regarding validation accuracy and segmentation effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shikun Ban, Juling Fan, Xiaoxuan Ma, Wentao Zhu, Yu Qiao, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating robot pose from RGB images is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics. While previous methods have achieved promising performance, most of them presume full knowledge of robot internal states, e.g. ground-truth robot joint angles. However, this assumption is not always valid in practical situations. In real-world applications such as multi-robot collaboration or human-robot interaction, the robot joint states might not be shared or could be unreliable. On the other hand, existing approaches that estimate robot pose without joint state priors suffer from heavy computation burdens and thus cannot support real-time applications. This work introduces an efficient framework for real-time robot pose estimation from RGB images without requiring known robot states. Our method estimates camera-to-robot rotation, robot state parameters, keypoint locations, and root depth, employing a neural network module for each task to facilitate learning and sim-to-real transfer. Notably, it achieves inference in a single feed-forward pass without iterative optimization. Our approach offers a 12-time speed increase with state-of-the-art accuracy, enabling real-time holistic robot pose estimation for the first time.

<p>Abstract: In the field of digital content creation, generating high-quality 3D characters from single images is challenging, especially given the complexities of various body poses and the issues of self-occlusion and pose ambiguity. In this paper, we present CharacterGen, a framework developed to efficiently generate 3D characters. CharacterGen introduces a streamlined generation pipeline along with an image-conditioned multi-view diffusion model. This model effectively calibrates input poses to a canonical form while retaining key attributes of the input image, thereby addressing the challenges posed by diverse poses. A transformer-based, generalizable sparse-view reconstruction model is the other core component of our approach, facilitating the creation of detailed 3D models from multi-view images. We also adopt a texture-back-projection strategy to produce high-quality texture maps. Additionally, we have curated a dataset of anime characters, rendered in multiple poses and views, to train and evaluate our model. Our approach has been thoroughly evaluated through quantitative and qualitative experiments, showing its proficiency in generating 3D characters with high-quality shapes and textures, ready for downstream applications such as rigging and animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yang, Hossein Rahmani, Sue Black, Bryan M. Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Class activation maps (CAMs) are commonly employed in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) to produce pseudo-labels. Due to incomplete or excessive class activation, existing studies often resort to offline CAM refinement, introducing additional stages or proposing offline modules. This can cause optimization difficulties for single-stage methods and limit generalizability. In this study, we aim to reduce the observed CAM inconsistency and error to mitigate reliance on refinement processes. We propose an end-to-end WSSS model incorporating guided CAMs, wherein our segmentation model is trained while concurrently optimizing CAMs online. Our method, Co-training with Swapping Assignments (CoSA), leverages a dual-stream framework, where one sub-network learns from the swapped assignments generated by the other. We introduce three techniques: i) soft perplexity-based regularization to penalize uncertain regions; ii) a threshold-searching approach to dynamically revise the confidence threshold; and iii) contrastive separation to address the coexistence problem. CoSA demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving mIoU of 76.2\% and 51.0\% on VOC and COCO validation datasets, respectively, surpassing existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, CoSA is the first single-stage approach to outperform all existing multi-stage methods including those with additional supervision.

<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction based on multi-sensor fusion,crucial for a reliable autonomous driving system, enables fine-grained understanding of 3D scenes. Previous fusion-based 3D occupancy predictions relied on depth estimation for processing 2D image features. However, depth estimation is an ill-posed problem, hindering the accuracy and robustness of these methods. Furthermore, fine-grained occupancy prediction demands extensive computational resources. To address these issues, we propose OccFusion, a depth estimation free multi-modal fusion framework. Additionally, we introduce a generalizable active training method and an active decoder that can be applied to any occupancy prediction model, with the potential to enhance their performance. Experiments conducted on nuScenes-Occupancy and nuScenes-Occ3D demonstrate our framework's superior performance. Detailed ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of each proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruinan Jin, Wenlong Deng, Minghui Chen, Xiaoxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of Foundation Models' (FMs) rising prominence in AI, our study addresses the challenge of biases in medical images while the model operates in black-box (e.g., using FM API), particularly spurious correlations between pixels and sensitive attributes. Traditional methods for bias mitigation face limitations due to the restricted access to web-hosted FMs and difficulties in addressing the underlying bias encoded within the FM API. We propose a D(ebiased) N(oise) E(diting) strategy, termed DNE, which generates DNE noise to mask such spurious correlation. DNE is capable of mitigating bias both within the FM API embedding and the images themselves. Furthermore, DNE is suitable for both white-box and black-box FM APIs, where we introduced G(reedy) (Z)eroth-O(rder) (GeZO) optimization for it when the gradient is inaccessible in black-box APIs. Our whole pipeline enables fairness-aware image editing that can be applied across various medical contexts without requiring direct model manipulation or significant computational resources. Our empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining fairness and utility across different patient groups and diseases. In the era of AI-driven medicine, this work contributes to making healthcare diagnostics more equitable, showcasing a practical solution for bias mitigation in pre-trained image FMs. Our code is provided at https://github.com/ubc-tea/DNE-foundation-model-fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lang Nie, Chunyu Lin, Kang Liao, Yun Zhang, Shuaicheng Liu, Rui Ai, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, when extending image stitching to video stitching. It unveils the temporal instability of warped content in non-overlapping regions, despite image stitching having endeavored to preserve the natural structures. Therefore, in most cases, even if the input videos to be stitched are stable, the stitched video will inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To eliminate the shakes, we propose StabStitch to simultaneously realize video stitching and video stabilization in a unified unsupervised learning framework. Starting from the camera paths in video stabilization, we first derive the expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Then a warp smoothing model is presented to optimize them with a comprehensive consideration regarding content alignment, trajectory smoothness, spatial consistency, and online collaboration. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Compared with existing stitching solutions, StabStitch exhibits significant superiority in scene robustness and inference speed in addition to stitching and stabilization performance, contributing to a robust and real-time online video stitching system.

<p>Abstract: Sparse 3D detectors have received significant attention since the query-based paradigm embraces low latency without explicit dense BEV feature construction. However, these detectors achieve worse performance than their dense counterparts. In this paper, we find the key to bridging the performance gap is to enhance the awareness of rich representations in two modalities. Here, we present a high-performance fully sparse detector for end-to-end multi-modality 3D object detection. The detector, termed SparseLIF, contains three key designs, which are (1) Perspective-Aware Query Generation (PAQG) to generate high-quality 3D queries with perspective priors, (2) RoI-Aware Sampling (RIAS) to further refine prior queries by sampling RoI features from each modality, (3) Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF) to precisely quantify the uncertainty of each sensor modality and adaptively conduct final multi-modality fusion, thus achieving great robustness against sensor noises. By the time of paper submission, SparseLIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, ranking 1st on both validation set and test benchmark, outperforming all state-of-the-art 3D object detectors by a notable margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeongjun Park, Hyojun Go, Jin-Young Kim, Sangmin Woo, Seokil Ham, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a range of generative tasks. Recent efforts to enhance diffusion model architectures have reimagined them as a form of multi-task learning, where each task corresponds to a denoising task at a specific noise level. While these efforts have focused on parameter isolation and task routing, they fall short of capturing detailed inter-task relationships and risk losing semantic information, respectively. In response, we introduce Switch Diffusion Transformer (Switch-DiT), which establishes inter-task relationships between conflicting tasks without compromising semantic information. To achieve this, we employ a sparse mixture-of-experts within each transformer block to utilize semantic information and facilitate handling conflicts in tasks through parameter isolation. Additionally, we propose a diffusion prior loss, encouraging similar tasks to share their denoising paths while isolating conflicting ones. Through these, each transformer block contains a shared expert across all tasks, where the common and task-specific denoising paths enable the diffusion model to construct its beneficial way of synergizing denoising tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving both image quality and convergence rate, and further analysis demonstrates that Switch-DiT constructs tailored denoising paths across various generation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enguang Wang, Zhimao Peng, Zhengyuan Xie, Fei Yang, Xialei Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Given unlabelled datasets containing both old and new categories, generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to accurately discover new classes while correctly classifying old classes, leveraging the class concepts learned from labeled samples. Current GCD methods only use a single visual modality of information, resulting in poor classification of visually similar classes. As a different modality, text information can provide complementary discriminative information, which motivates us to introduce it into the GCD task. However, the lack of class names for unlabelled data makes it impractical to utilize text information. To tackle this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a Text Embedding Synthesizer (TES) to generate pseudo text embeddings for unlabelled samples. Specifically, our TES leverages the property that CLIP can generate aligned vision-language features, converting visual embeddings into tokens of the CLIP's text encoder to generate pseudo text embeddings. Besides, we employ a dual-branch framework, through the joint learning and instance consistency of different modality branches, visual and semantic information mutually enhance each other, promoting the interaction and fusion of visual and text knowledge. Our method unlocks the multi-modal potentials of CLIP and outperforms the baseline methods by a large margin on all GCD benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art.

It tackles key challenges in contrastive multi-modal medical imaging analysis, notably data scarcity and the "modality gap" -- a significant disparity between image and text embeddings that diminishes the quality of representations and hampers cross-modal interoperability. eCLIP integrates a heatmap processor and leverages mixup augmentation to efficiently utilize the scarce expert annotations, thus boosting the model's learning effectiveness. eCLIP is designed to be generally applicable to any variant of CLIP without requiring any modifications of the core architecture. Through detailed evaluations across several tasks, including zero-shot inference, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) of radiology reports using a frozen Large Language Model, eCLIP showcases consistent improvements in embedding quality. The outcomes reveal enhanced alignment and uniformity, affirming eCLIP's capability to harness high-quality annotations for enriched multi-modal analysis in the medical imaging domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhe Wu, Kede Ma, Jie Liang, Yujiu Yang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced significant advancement in visual understanding and reasoning, their potential to serve as powerful, flexible, interpretable, and text-driven models for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of prompting MLLMs for IQA. We first investigate nine prompting systems for MLLMs as the combinations of three standardized testing procedures in psychophysics (i.e., the single-stimulus, double-stimulus, and multiple-stimulus methods) and three popular prompting strategies in natural language processing (i.e., the standard, in-context, and chain-of-thought prompting). We then present a difficult sample selection procedure, taking into account sample diversity and uncertainty, to further challenge MLLMs equipped with the respective optimal prompting systems. We assess three open-source and one closed-source MLLMs on several visual attributes of image quality (e.g., structural and textural distortions, geometric transformations, and color differences) in both full-reference and no-reference scenarios. Experimental results show that only the closed-source GPT-4V provides a reasonable account for human perception of image quality, but is weak at discriminating fine-grained quality variations (e.g., color differences) and at comparing visual quality of multiple images, tasks humans can perform effortlessly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Zhang, Liang Zheng, Meng Wang, Dan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper develops small vision language models to understand visual art, which, given an art work, aims to identify its emotion category and explain this prediction with natural language. While small models are computationally efficient, their capacity is much limited compared with large models. To break this trade-off, this paper builds a small emotional vision language model (SEVLM) by emotion modeling and input-output feature alignment. On the one hand, based on valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) knowledge annotated by psychology experts, we introduce and fuse emotional features derived through VAD dictionary and a VAD head to align VAD vectors of predicted emotion explanation and the ground truth. This allows the vision language model to better understand and generate emotional texts, compared with using traditional text embeddings alone. On the other hand, we design a contrastive head to pull close embeddings of the image, its emotion class, and explanation, which aligns model outputs and inputs. On two public affective explanation datasets, we show that the proposed techniques consistently improve the visual art understanding performance of baseline SEVLMs. Importantly, the proposed model can be trained and evaluated on a single RTX 2080 Ti while exhibiting very strong performance: it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art small models but is also competitive compared with LLaVA 7B after fine-tuning and GPT4(V).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sensen Gao, Xiaojun Jia, Xuhong Ren, Ivor Tsang, Qing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs).Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability.In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs.To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods.Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Wu, Mingtao Feng, Yaonan Wang, He Xie, Weisheng Dong, Bo Miao, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic 3D scenes is challenging due to the complexity of room layouts and object geometries.We propose a sketch based knowledge enhanced diffusion architecture (SEK) for generating customized, diverse, and plausible 3D scenes. SEK conditions the denoising process with a hand-drawn sketch of the target scene and cues from an object relationship knowledge base. We first construct an external knowledge base containing object relationships and then leverage knowledge enhanced graph reasoning to assist our model in understanding hand-drawn sketches. A scene is represented as a combination of 3D objects and their relationships, and then incrementally diffused to reach a Gaussian distribution.We propose a 3D denoising scene transformer that learns to reverse the diffusion process, conditioned by a hand-drawn sketch along with knowledge cues, to regressively generate the scene including the 3D object instances as well as their layout. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that our model improves FID, CKL by 17.41%, 37.18% in 3D scene generation and FID, KID by 19.12%, 20.06% in 3D scene completion compared to the nearest competitor DiffuScene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoi Do, Duong Nguyen, Nguyen H. Tran, Viet Dung Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond class frequency, we recognize the impact of class-wise relationships among various class-specific predictions and the imbalance in label masks on long-tailed segmentation learning. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Pixel-wise Adaptive Training (PAT) technique tailored for long-tailed segmentation. PAT has two key features: 1) class-wise gradient magnitude homogenization, and 2) pixel-wise class-specific loss adaptation (PCLA). First, the class-wise gradient magnitude homogenization helps alleviate the imbalance among label masks by ensuring equal consideration of the class-wise impact on model updates. Second, PCLA tackles the detrimental impact of both rare classes within the long-tailed distribution and inaccurate predictions from previous training stages by encouraging learning classes with low prediction confidence and guarding against forgetting classes with high confidence. This combined approach fosters robust learning while preventing the model from forgetting previously learned knowledge. PAT exhibits significant performance improvements, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 2.2% in the NyU dataset. Moreover, it enhances overall pixel-wise accuracy by 2.85% and intersection over union value by 2.07%, with a particularly notable declination of 0.39% in detecting rare classes compared to Balance Logits Variation, as demonstrated on the three popular datasets, i.e., OxfordPetIII, CityScape, and NYU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yandan Yang, Baoxiong Jia, Peiyuan Zhi, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent developments in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) research, there has been a growing demand for high-quality, large-scale interactive scene generation. While prior methods in scene synthesis have prioritized the naturalness and realism of the generated scenes, the physical plausibility and interactivity of scenes have been largely left unexplored. To address this disparity, we introduce PhyScene, a novel method dedicated to generating interactive 3D scenes characterized by realistic layouts, articulated objects, and rich physical interactivity tailored for embodied agents. Based on a conditional diffusion model for capturing scene layouts, we devise novel physics- and interactivity-based guidance mechanisms that integrate constraints from object collision, room layout, and object reachability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PhyScene effectively leverages these guidance functions for physically interactable scene synthesis, outperforming existing state-of-the-art scene synthesis methods by a large margin. Our findings suggest that the scenes generated by PhyScene hold considerable potential for facilitating diverse skill acquisition among agents within interactive environments, thereby catalyzing further advancements in embodied AI research.

<p>Abstract: We introduce UPose3D, a novel approach for multi-view 3D human pose estimation, addressing challenges in accuracy and scalability. Our method advances existing pose estimation frameworks by improving robustness and flexibility without requiring direct 3D annotations. At the core of our method, a pose compiler module refines predictions from a 2D keypoints estimator that operates on a single image by leveraging temporal and cross-view information. Our novel cross-view fusion strategy is scalable to any number of cameras, while our synthetic data generation strategy ensures generalization across diverse actors, scenes, and viewpoints. Finally, UPose3D leverages the prediction uncertainty of both the 2D keypoint estimator and the pose compiler module. This provides robustness to outliers and noisy data, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution settings. In addition, for in-distribution settings, UPose3D yields performance rivalling methods that rely on 3D annotated data while being the state-of-the-art among methods relying only on 2D supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guosheng Lu, Zile Fang, Chunming He, Zhigang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to preserve thermal radiation information from infrared images while integrating texture details from visible images. The differences that infrared images primarily express thermal radiation through image intensity while visible images mainly represent texture details via image gradients, has long been considered a significant obstacle to IVIF technology development. Existing dual-discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use two identical discriminators to guide the model in learning different types of information. However, given the intrinsic differences between infrared and visible images, using two heterogeneous discriminators is more effective. This paper proposes a novel attention-based generator and heterogeneous dual-discriminator generative adversarial network (AHDGAN) for infrared and visible image fusion. Specifically, the model employs two structurally different discriminators to address the distinct learning needs of infrared and visible image information. These include a global discriminator for thermal radiation information and a Markovian discriminator for detailed information. Additionally, different multi-scale attention modules are introduced to help the discriminators focus better on their respective source images. Based on this, to integrate the learned information from different source images effectively, an attention mechanism is designed in the generator to construct an information fusion layer. This approach guides the model to learn thermal radiation information from infrared images while simultaneously capturing texture details from visible images. Extensive experiments on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed AHDGAN over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, highlighting its enhanced potential for practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiantian Zhang, Manxi Lin, Hongda Guo, Xiaofan Zhang, Ka Fung Peter Chiu, Aasa Feragen, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) is pivotal in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer through MRI imaging. Current deep learning-based PI-RADS scoring methods often lack the incorporation of common PI-RADS clinical guideline~(PICG) utilized by radiologists, potentially compromising scoring accuracy. This paper introduces a novel approach that adapts a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to incorporate PICG into PI-RADS scoring model without additional annotations and network parameters. We present a designed two-stage fine-tuning process aiming at adapting a MLLM originally trained on natural images to the MRI images while effectively integrating the PICG. Specifically, in the first stage, we develop a domain adapter layer tailored for processing 3D MRI inputs and instruct the MLLM to differentiate MRI sequences. In the second stage, we translate PICG for guiding instructions from the model to generate PICG-guided image features. Through such a feature distillation step, we align the scoring network's features with the PICG-guided image features, which enables the model to effectively incorporate the PICG information. We develop our model on a public dataset and evaluate it on an in-house dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively improves the performance of current scoring networks.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant traction due to their ability to generate high-fidelity and diverse images and videos conditioned on text prompts. In medicine, this application promises to address the critical challenge of data scarcity, a consequence of barriers in data sharing, stringent patient privacy regulations, and disparities in patient population and demographics. By generating realistic and varying medical 2D and 3D images, these models offer a rich, privacy-respecting resource for algorithmic training and research. To this end, we introduce MediSyn, a pair of instruction-tuned text-guided latent diffusion models with the ability to generate high-fidelity and diverse medical 2D and 3D images across specialties and modalities. Through established metrics, we show significant improvement in broad medical image and video synthesis guided by text prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Teng, Yue Wu, Han Shi, Xuefei Ning, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang, Zhenguo Li, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation, with the backbone evolving from U-Net to Vision Transformers. However, the computational cost of Transformers is quadratic to the number of tokens, leading to significant challenges when dealing with high-resolution images. In this work, we propose Diffusion Mamba (DiM), which combines the efficiency of Mamba, a sequence model based on State Space Models (SSM), with the expressive power of diffusion models for efficient high-resolution image synthesis. To address the challenge that Mamba cannot generalize to 2D signals, we make several architecture designs including multi-directional scans, learnable padding tokens at the end of each row and column, and lightweight local feature enhancement. Our DiM architecture achieves inference-time efficiency for high-resolution images. In addition, to further improve training efficiency for high-resolution image generation with DiM, we investigate "weak-to-strong" training strategy that pretrains DiM on low-resolution images ($256\times 256$) and then finetune it on high-resolution images ($512 \times 512$). We further explore training-free upsampling strategies to enable the model to generate higher-resolution images (e.g., $1024\times 1024$ and $1536\times 1536$) without further fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiM. The code of our work is available here: {\url{https://github.com/tyshiwo1/DiM-DiffusionMamba/}}.</p>

<p>Abstract: A plant growth simulation can be characterized as a reconstructed visual representation of a plant or plant system. The phenotypic characteristics and plant structures are controlled by the scene environment and other contextual attributes. Considering the temporal dependencies and compounding effects of various factors on growth trajectories, we formulate a probabilistic approach to the simulation task by solving a frame synthesis and pattern recognition problem. We introduce a sequence-informed plant growth simulation framework (SI-PGS) that employs a conditional generative model to implicitly learn a distribution of possible plant representations within a dynamic scene from a fusion of low-dimensional temporal sensor and context data. Methods such as controlled latent sampling and recurrent output connections are used to improve coherence in the plant structures between frames of prediction. In this work, we demonstrate that SI-PGS is able to capture temporal dependencies and continuously generate realistic frames of plant growth.</p>

In this work, we go further and study DDPMs trained on strictly separate subsets of the data distribution with large gaps on the support of the latent factors. We show that such a model can effectively generate images in the unexplored, intermediate regions of the distribution. For instance, when trained on clearly smiling and non-smiling faces, we demonstrate a sampling procedure which can generate slightly smiling faces without reference images (zero-shot interpolation). We replicate these findings for other attributes as well as other datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jdeschena/ddpm-zero-shot-interpolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Senran Fan, Zhicheng Bao, Chen Dong, Haotai Liang, Xiaodong Xu, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic communication, as a revolutionary communication architecture, is considered a promising novel communication paradigm. Unlike traditional symbol-based error-free communication systems, semantic-based visual communication systems extract, compress, transmit, and reconstruct images at the semantic level. However, widely used image similarity evaluation metrics, whether pixel-based MSE or PSNR or structure-based MS-SSIM, struggle to accurately measure the loss of semantic-level information of the source during system transmission. This presents challenges in evaluating the performance of visual semantic communication systems, especially when comparing them with traditional communication systems. To address this, we propose a semantic evaluation metric -- SeSS (Semantic Similarity Score), based on Scene Graph Generation and graph matching, which shifts the similarity scores between images into semantic-level graph matching scores. Meanwhile, semantic similarity scores for tens of thousands of image pairs are manually annotated to fine-tune the hyperparameters in the graph matching algorithm, aligning the metric more closely with human semantic perception. The performance of the SeSS is tested on different datasets, including (1)images transmitted by traditional and semantic communication systems at different compression rates, (2)images transmitted by traditional and semantic communication systems at different signal-to-noise ratios, (3)images generated by large-scale model with different noise levels introduced, and (4)cases of images subjected to certain special transformations. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SeSS, indicating that the metric can measure the semantic-level differences in semantic-level information of images and can be used for evaluation in visual semantic communication systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Histopathology can help clinicians make accurate diagnoses, determine disease prognosis, and plan appropriate treatment strategies. As deep learning techniques prove successful in the medical domain, the primary challenges become limited data availability and concerns about data sharing and privacy. Federated learning has addressed this challenge by training models locally and updating parameters on a server. However, issues, such as domain shift and bias, persist and impact overall performance. Dataset distillation presents an alternative approach to overcoming these challenges. It involves creating a small synthetic dataset that encapsulates essential information, which can be shared without constraints. At present, this paradigm is not practicable as current distillation approaches only generate non human readable representations and exhibit insufficient performance for downstream learning tasks. We train a latent diffusion model and construct a new distilled synthetic dataset with a small number of human readable synthetic images. Selection of maximally informative synthetic images is done via graph community analysis of the representation space. We compare downstream classification models trained on our synthetic distillation data to models trained on real data and reach performances suitable for practical application.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent surge in large-scale generative models has spurred the development of vast fields in computer vision. In particular, text-to-image diffusion models have garnered widespread adoption across diverse domain due to their potential for high-fidelity image generation. Nonetheless, existing large-scale diffusion models are confined to generate images of up to 1K resolution, which is far from meeting the demands of contemporary commercial applications. Directly sampling higher-resolution images often yields results marred by artifacts such as object repetition and distorted shapes. Addressing the aforementioned issues typically necessitates training or fine-tuning models on higher resolution datasets. However, this undertaking poses a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale high-resolution contents and substantial computational resources. While several preceding works have proposed alternatives, they often fail to produce convincing results. In this work, we probe the generative ability of diffusion models at higher resolution beyond its original capability and propose a novel progressive approach that fully utilizes generated low-resolution image to guide the generation of higher resolution image. Our method obviates the need for additional training or fine-tuning which significantly lowers the burden of computational costs. Extensive experiments and results validate the efficiency and efficacy of our method. Project page: https://yhyun225.github.io/DiffusHigh/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Punnawat Siripathitti, Florent Forest, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Damage to road pavement can develop into cracks, potholes, spallings, and other issues posing significant challenges to the integrity, safety, and durability of the road structure. Detecting and monitoring the evolution of these damages is crucial for maintaining the condition and structural health of road infrastructure. In recent years, researchers have explored various data-driven methods for image-based damage detection in road monitoring applications. The field gained attention with the introduction of the Road Damage Detection Challenge (RDDC2018), encouraging competition in developing object detectors on street-view images from various countries. Leading teams have demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble models, mostly based on the YOLO and Faster R-CNN series. Data augmentations have also shown benefits in object detection within the computer vision field, including transformations such as random flipping, cropping, cutting out patches, as well as cut-and-pasting object instances. Applying cut-and-paste augmentation to road damages appears to be a promising approach to increase data diversity. However, the standard cut-and-paste technique, which involves sampling an object instance from a random image and pasting it at a random location onto the target image, has demonstrated limited effectiveness for road damage detection. This method overlooks the location of the road and disregards the difference in perspective between the sampled damage and the target image, resulting in unrealistic augmented images. In this work, we propose an improved Cut-and-Paste augmentation technique that is both content-aware (i.e. considers the true location of the road in the image) and perspective-aware (i.e. takes into account the difference in perspective between the injected damage and the target image).</p>

This paper introduces a framework optimised for the joint task of focal deblurring (refocusing) and video super-resolution (VSR). The proposed method employs novel map guided transformers, in addition to image propagation, to effectively leverage the continuous spatial variance of focal blur and restore the footage. We also introduce a flow re-focusing module to efficiently align relevant features between the blurry and sharp domains. Additionally, we propose a novel technique for generating synthetic focal blur data, broadening the model's learning capabilities to include a wider array of content. We have made a new benchmark dataset, DAVIS-Blur, available. This dataset, a modified extension of the popular DAVIS video segmentation set, provides realistic out-of-focus blur degradations as well as the corresponding blur maps. Comprehensive experiments on DAVIS-Blur demonstrate the superiority of our approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results with an average PSNR performance over 1.9dB greater than comparable existing video restoration methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avraham Raviv, Yizhak Y. Elboher, Michelle Aluf-Medina, Yael Leibovich Weiss, Omer Cohen, Roy Assa, Guy Katz, Hillel Kugler</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are ubiquitous in real-world applications, yet they remain vulnerable to errors and adversarial attacks. This work tackles the challenge of applying formal verification to ensure the safety of computer vision models, extending verification beyond image classification to object detection. We propose a general formulation for certifying the robustness of object detection models using formal verification and outline implementation strategies compatible with state-of-the-art verification tools. Our approach enables the application of these tools, originally designed for verifying classification models, to object detection. We define various attacks for object detection, illustrating the diverse ways adversarial inputs can compromise neural network outputs. Our experiments, conducted on several common datasets and networks, reveal potential errors in object detection models, highlighting system vulnerabilities and emphasizing the need for expanding formal verification to these new domains. This work paves the way for further research in integrating formal verification across a broader range of computer vision applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding documents with rich layouts and multi-modal components is a long-standing and practical task. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents. These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs. Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing human datasets for avatar creation are typically limited to laboratory environments, wherein high-quality annotations (e.g., SMPL estimation from 3D scans or multi-view images) can be ideally provided. However, their annotating requirements are impractical for real-world images or videos, posing challenges toward real-world applications on current avatar creation methods. To this end, we propose the WildAvatar dataset, a web-scale in-the-wild human avatar creation dataset extracted from YouTube, with $10,000+$ different human subjects and scenes. WildAvatar is at least $10\times$ richer than previous datasets for 3D human avatar creation. We evaluate several state-of-the-art avatar creation methods on our dataset, highlighting the unexplored challenges in real-world applications on avatar creation. We also demonstrate the potential for generalizability of avatar creation methods, when provided with data at scale. We publicly release our data source links and annotations, to push forward 3D human avatar creation and other related fields for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision, enabling effective learning across different domains. However, their performance under domain shift is yet underexplored. This paper investigates the zero-shot domain adaptation potential of FMs by comparing different backbone architectures and introducing novel domain-aware components that leverage domain related textual embeddings. We propose domain adaptive normalization, termed as Domino, which explicitly leverages domain embeddings during fine-tuning, thus making the model domain aware. Ultimately, Domino enables more robust computer vision models that can adapt effectively to various unseen domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Mu, Xinxin Zuo, Chuan Guo, Yilin Wang, Juwei Lu, Xiaofeng Wu, Songcen Xu, Peng Dai, Youliang Yan, Li Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GSD, a diffusion model approach based on Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation for 3D object reconstruction from a single view. Prior works suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate 3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative 3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Project page: $\href{https://yxmu.foo/GSD/}{\text{this https URL}}$</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexian Huang, Kourosh Khoshelham, Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Corporation, Martin Tomko</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of large-scale 3D landscape meshes is pivotal for various geospatial applications, including spatial analysis, automatic mapping and localization of target objects, and urban planning and development. This requires an efficient and accurate 3D perception system to understand and analyze real-world environments. However, traditional mesh segmentation methods face challenges in accurately segmenting small objects and maintaining computational efficiency due to the complexity and large size of 3D landscape mesh datasets. This paper presents an end-to-end deep graph message-passing network, LMSeg, designed to efficiently and accurately perform semantic segmentation on large-scale 3D landscape meshes. The proposed approach takes the barycentric dual graph of meshes as inputs and applies deep message-passing neural networks to hierarchically capture the geometric and spatial features from the barycentric graph structures and learn intricate semantic information from textured meshes. The hierarchical and local pooling of the barycentric graph, along with the effective geometry aggregation modules of LMSeg, enable fast inference and accurate segmentation of small-sized and irregular mesh objects in various complex landscapes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (natural and urban landscapes) demonstrate that LMSeg significantly outperforms existing learning-based segmentation methods in terms of object segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities across diverse landscapes and demonstrates robust resilience against varying mesh densities and landscape topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Zeng, Le Zhang, Yipeng Liu, Ce Zhu, Fan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While deep learning approaches using fundus images have largely improved early diagnosis of glaucoma, variations in images from different devices and locations (known as domain shifts) challenge the use of pre-trained models in real-world settings. To address this, we propose a novel Graph-guided Test-Time Adaptation (GTTA) framework to generalize glaucoma diagnosis models to unseen test environments. GTTA integrates the topological information of fundus images into the model training, enhancing the model's transferability and reducing the risk of learning spurious correlation. During inference, GTTA introduces a novel test-time training objective to make the source-trained classifier progressively adapt to target patterns with reliable class conditional estimation and consistency regularization. Experiments on cross-domain glaucoma diagnosis benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the overall framework and individual components under different backbone networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Guo, Yuan Gao, Yuxu Lu, Huilin Zhu, Ryan Wen Liu, Shengfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, image impairments often manifest as composite degradations, presenting a complex interplay of elements such as low light, haze, rain, and snow. Despite this reality, existing restoration methods typically target isolated degradation types, thereby falling short in environments where multiple degrading factors coexist. To bridge this gap, our study proposes a versatile imaging model that consolidates four physical corruption paradigms to accurately represent complex, composite degradation scenarios. In this context, we propose OneRestore, a novel transformer-based framework designed for adaptive, controllable scene restoration. The proposed framework leverages a unique cross-attention mechanism, merging degraded scene descriptors with image features, allowing for nuanced restoration. Our model allows versatile input scene descriptors, ranging from manual text embeddings to automatic extractions based on visual attributes. Our methodology is further enhanced through a composite degradation restoration loss, using extra degraded images as negative samples to fortify model constraints. Comparative results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate OneRestore as a superior solution, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in addressing complex, composite degradations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huitong Pan, Qi Zhang, Cornelia Caragea, Eduard Dragut, Longin Jan Latecki</p>
<p>Abstract: Flowcharts are graphical tools for representing complex concepts in concise visual representations. This paper introduces the FlowLearn dataset, a resource tailored to enhance the understanding of flowcharts. FlowLearn contains complex scientific flowcharts and simulated flowcharts. The scientific subset contains 3,858 flowcharts sourced from scientific literature and the simulated subset contains 10,000 flowcharts created using a customizable script. The dataset is enriched with annotations for visual components, OCR, Mermaid code representation, and VQA question-answer pairs. Despite the proven capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in various visual understanding tasks, their effectiveness in decoding flowcharts - a crucial element of scientific communication - has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The FlowLearn test set is crafted to assess the performance of LVLMs in flowchart comprehension. Our study thoroughly evaluates state-of-the-art LVLMs, identifying existing limitations and establishing a foundation for future enhancements in this relatively underexplored domain. For instance, in tasks involving simulated flowcharts, GPT-4V achieved the highest accuracy (58%) in counting the number of nodes, while Claude recorded the highest accuracy (83%) in OCR tasks. Notably, no single model excels in all tasks within the FlowLearn framework, highlighting significant opportunities for further development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Qian, Yiwei Ma, Zhekai Lin, Jiayi Ji, Xiawu Zheng, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D referring expression comprehension (3DREC) and segmentation (3DRES) have overlapping objectives, indicating their potential for collaboration. However, existing collaborative approaches predominantly depend on the results of one task to make predictions for the other, limiting effective collaboration. We argue that employing separate branches for 3DREC and 3DRES tasks enhances the model's capacity to learn specific information for each task, enabling them to acquire complementary knowledge. Thus, we propose the MCLN framework, which includes independent branches for 3DREC and 3DRES tasks. This enables dedicated exploration of each task and effective coordination between the branches. Furthermore, to facilitate mutual reinforcement between these branches, we introduce a Relative Superpoint Aggregation (RSA) module and an Adaptive Soft Alignment (ASA) module. These modules significantly contribute to the precise alignment of prediction results from the two branches, directing the module to allocate increased attention to key positions. Comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the 3DREC and 3DRES tasks, with an increase of 2.05% in Acc@0.5 for 3DREC and 3.96% in mIoU for 3DRES.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xu, Lingdong Kong, Hui Shuai, Wenwei Zhang, Liang Pan, Kai Chen, Ziwei Liu, Qingshan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of autonomous driving, accurate 3D perception is the foundation. However, developing such models relies on extensive human annotations -- a process that is both costly and labor-intensive. To address this challenge from a data representation learning perspective, we introduce SuperFlow, a novel framework designed to harness consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs for establishing spatiotemporal pretraining objectives. SuperFlow stands out by integrating two key designs: 1) a dense-to-sparse consistency regularization, which promotes insensitivity to point cloud density variations during feature learning, and 2) a flow-based contrastive learning module, carefully crafted to extract meaningful temporal cues from readily available sensor calibrations. To further boost learning efficiency, we incorporate a plug-and-play view consistency module that enhances the alignment of the knowledge distilled from camera views. Extensive comparative and ablation studies across 11 heterogeneous LiDAR datasets validate our effectiveness and superiority. Additionally, we observe several interesting emerging properties by scaling up the 2D and 3D backbones during pretraining, shedding light on the future research of 3D foundation models for LiDAR-based perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivaan Singhvi, Langalibalele Lunga, Pragya Nidhi, Chris Keum, Varrun Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping refers to the non-destructive and efficient evaluation of plant phenotypes. In recent years, it has been coupled with machine learning in order to improve the process of phenotyping plants by increasing efficiency in handling large datasets and developing methods for the extraction of specific traits. Previous studies have developed methods to advance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in tandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often excluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white labels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and genotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on the plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning algorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models were used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed encoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and correlations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of 94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be accurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf shape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%, and plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%. Finally, we identified a few crucial pieces of information absent from the EXIF tags that prevented the assessment of the leaf size. There was also missing information that prevented the assessment of correlations between phenotypes and conditions. However, future studies could improve upon this to allow for the assessment of these features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work on image content manipulation based on vision-language pre-training models has been effectively extended to text-driven 3D scene editing. However, existing schemes for 3D scene editing still exhibit certain shortcomings, hindering their further interactive design. Such schemes typically adhere to fixed input patterns, limiting users' flexibility in text input. Moreover, their editing capabilities are constrained by a single or a few 2D visual models and require intricate pipeline design to integrate these models into 3D reconstruction processes. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dialogue-based 3D scene editing approach, termed CE3D, which is centered around a large language model that allows for arbitrary textual input from users and interprets their intentions, subsequently facilitating the autonomous invocation of the corresponding visual expert models. Furthermore, we design a scheme utilizing Hash-Atlas to represent 3D scene views, which transfers the editing of 3D scenes onto 2D atlas images. This design achieves complete decoupling between the 2D editing and 3D reconstruction processes, enabling CE3D to flexibly integrate a wide range of existing 2D or 3D visual models without necessitating intricate fusion designs. Experimental results demonstrate that CE3D effectively integrates multiple visual models to achieve diverse editing visual effects, possessing strong scene comprehension and multi-round dialog capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Although most current large multimodal models (LMMs) can already understand photos of natural scenes and portraits, their understanding of abstract images, e.g., charts, maps, or layouts, and visual reasoning capabilities remains quite rudimentary. They often struggle with simple daily tasks, such as reading time from a clock, understanding a flowchart, or planning a route using a road map. In light of this, we design a multi-modal self-instruct, utilizing large language models and their code capabilities to synthesize massive abstract images and visual reasoning instructions across daily scenarios. Our strategy effortlessly creates a multimodal benchmark with 11,193 instructions for eight visual scenarios: charts, tables, simulated maps, dashboards, flowcharts, relation graphs, floor plans, and visual puzzles. \textbf{This benchmark, constructed with simple lines and geometric elements, exposes the shortcomings of most advanced LMMs} like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o in abstract image understanding, spatial relations reasoning, and visual element induction. Besides, to verify the quality of our synthetic data, we fine-tune an LMM using 62,476 synthetic chart, table and road map instructions. The results demonstrate improved chart understanding and map navigation performance, and also demonstrate potential benefits for other visual reasoning tasks.

Most LLIE methods overlook this, hindering their effectiveness. In this study, we investigate the effects of JPEG compression on low-light images and reveal substantial information loss caused by JPEG due to widespread low pixel values in dark areas. Hence, we propose the Compression-Aware Pre-trained Transformer (CAPformer), employing a novel pre-training strategy to learn lossless information from uncompressed low-light images. Additionally, the proposed Brightness-Guided Self-Attention (BGSA) mechanism enhances rational information gathering. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in mitigating compression effects on LLIE, showcasing its potential for improving LLIE in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seong Hun Lee, Javier Civera</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low latency rates are crucial for online video-based applications, such as video conferencing and cloud gaming, which make improving video quality in online scenarios increasingly important. However, existing quality enhancement methods are limited by slow inference speed and the requirement for temporal information contained in future frames, making it challenging to deploy them directly in online tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, STLVQE, specifically designed to address the rarely studied online video quality enhancement (Online-VQE) problem. Our STLVQE designs a new VQE framework which contains a Module-Agnostic Feature Extractor that greatly reduces the redundant computations and redesign the propagation, alignment, and enhancement module of the network. A Spatial-Temporal Look-up Tables (STL) is proposed, which extracts spatial-temporal information in videos while saving substantial inference time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit the LUT structure to extract temporal information in video tasks. Extensive experiments on the MFQE 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our STLVQE achieves a satisfactory performance-speed trade-off.</p>

Many existing methods fall short when it comes to modelling volumetric effects as they rely purely on surface rendering. We thus propose to model the scene with polygons, which can then be used to obtain the quadrature points required to model volumetric effects, and also their opacity and colour from the texture. To obtain such polygonal mesh, we train a specialized field whose zero-crossings would correspond to the quadrature points when volume rendering, and perform marching cubes on this field. We then perform ray-tracing and utilize the ray-tracing shader to obtain the final colour image. Our method allows an easy integration with existing graphics frameworks allowing rendering speed of over 100 frames-per-second for a $1920\times1080$ image, while still being able to represent non-opaque objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dilyara Bareeva, Marina M. -C. H\"ohne, Alexander Warnecke, Lukas Pirch, Klaus-Robert M\"uller, Konrad Rieck, Kirill Bykov</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are capable of learning complex and versatile representations, however, the semantic nature of the learned concepts remains unknown. A common method used to explain the concepts learned by DNNs is Feature Visualization (FV), which generates a synthetic input signal that maximally activates a particular neuron in the network. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of this approach to adversarial model manipulations and introduce a novel method for manipulating FV without significantly impacting the model's decision-making process. The key distinction of our proposed approach is that it does not alter the model architecture. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on several neural network models and demonstrate its capabilities to hide the functionality of arbitrarily chosen neurons by masking the original explanations of neurons with chosen target explanations during model auditing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kejing Lu, Chuan Xiao, Yoshiharu Ishikawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional spaces is a pivotal challenge in the field of machine learning. In recent years, graph-based methods have emerged as the superior approach to ANNS, establishing a new state of the art. Although various optimizations for graph-based ANNS have been introduced, they predominantly rely on heuristic methods that lack formal theoretical backing. This paper aims to enhance routing within graph-based ANNS by introducing a method that offers a probabilistic guarantee when exploring a node's neighbors in the graph. We formulate the problem as probabilistic routing and develop two baseline strategies by incorporating locality-sensitive techniques. Subsequently, we introduce PEOs, a novel approach that efficiently identifies which neighbors in the graph should be considered for exact distance calculation, thus significantly improving efficiency in practice. Our experiments demonstrate that equipping PEOs can increase throughput on commonly utilized graph indexes (HNSW and NSSG) by a factor of 1.6 to 2.5, and its efficiency consistently outperforms the leading-edge routing technique by 1.1 to 1.4 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian R. Bartoldson, James Diffenderfer, Konstantinos Parasyris, Bhavya Kailkhura</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper revisits the simple, long-studied, yet still unsolved problem of making image classifiers robust to imperceptible perturbations. Taking CIFAR10 as an example, SOTA clean accuracy is about $100$%, but SOTA robustness to $\ell_{\infty}$-norm bounded perturbations barely exceeds $70$%. To understand this gap, we analyze how model size, dataset size, and synthetic data quality affect robustness by developing the first scaling laws for adversarial training. Our scaling laws reveal inefficiencies in prior art and provide actionable feedback to advance the field. For instance, we discovered that SOTA methods diverge notably from compute-optimal setups, using excess compute for their level of robustness. Leveraging a compute-efficient setup, we surpass the prior SOTA with $20$% ($70$%) fewer training (inference) FLOPs. We trained various compute-efficient models, with our best achieving $74$% AutoAttack accuracy ($+3$% gain). However, our scaling laws also predict robustness slowly grows then plateaus at $90$%: dwarfing our new SOTA by scaling is impractical, and perfect robustness is impossible. To better understand this predicted limit, we carry out a small-scale human evaluation on the AutoAttack data that fools our top-performing model. Concerningly, we estimate that human performance also plateaus near $90$%, which we show to be attributable to $\ell_{\infty}$-constrained attacks' generation of invalid images not consistent with their original labels. Having characterized limiting roadblocks, we outline promising paths for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer F. Atli, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Mahmut Yurt, Onat Dalmaz, Tolga \c{C}ukur</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have pushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local filtering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity comes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise learning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets. Here, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image synthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to efficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do this, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck of a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn context across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to learn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive demonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in synthesizing target-modality images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juanhua Zhang, Ruodan Yan, Alessandro Perelli, Xi Chen, Chao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an important neuroimaging technique with high acquisition costs. Deep learning approaches have been used to enhance dMRI and predict diffusion biomarkers through undersampled dMRI. To generate more comprehensive raw dMRI, generative adversarial network based methods are proposed to include b-values and b-vectors as conditions, but they are limited by unstable training and less desirable diversity. The emerging diffusion model (DM) promises to improve generative performance. However, it remains challenging to include essential information in conditioning DM for more relevant generation, i.e., the physical principles of dMRI and white matter tract structures. In this study, we propose a physics-guided diffusion model to generate high-quality dMRI. Our model introduces the physical principles of dMRI in the noise evolution in the diffusion process and introduce a query-based conditional mapping within the difussion model. In addition, to enhance the anatomical fine detials of the generation, we introduce the XTRACT atlas as prior of white matter tracts by adopting an adapter technique. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance dMRI enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Cui, Ruochen Wang, Yuanhao Xiong, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation has emerged as a technique for compressing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts, facilitating downstream training tasks. In this paper, we study the impact of bias inside the original dataset on the performance of dataset distillation. With a comprehensive empirical evaluation on canonical datasets with color, corruption and background biases, we found that color and background biases in the original dataset will be amplified through the distillation process, resulting in a notable decline in the performance of models trained on the distilled dataset, while corruption bias is suppressed through the distillation process. To reduce bias amplification in dataset distillation, we introduce a simple yet highly effective approach based on a sample reweighting scheme utilizing kernel density estimation. Empirical results on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, on CMNIST with 5% bias-conflict ratio and IPC 50, our method achieves 91.5% test accuracy compared to 23.8% from vanilla DM, boosting the performance by 67.7%, whereas applying state-of-the-art debiasing method on the same dataset only achieves 53.7% accuracy. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing biases in dataset distillation and provide a promising avenue to address bias amplification in the process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate identification, localization, and segregation of teeth from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images are essential for analyzing dental pathologies. Modeling an individual tooth can be challenging and intricate to accomplish, especially when fillings and other restorations introduce artifacts. This paper proposes a method for automatically detecting, identifying, and extracting teeth from CBCT images. Our approach involves dividing the three-dimensional images into axial slices for image detection. Teeth are pinpointed and labeled using a single-stage object detector. Subsequently, bounding boxes are delineated and identified to create three-dimensional representations of each tooth. The proposed solution has been successfully integrated into the dental analysis tool Dentomo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianuo Huang, Zhenlong Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous driving, ensuring safety during motion planning and navigation is becoming more and more important. However, most end-to-end planning methods suffer from a lack of safety. This research addresses the safety issue in the control optimization problem of autonomous driving, formulated as Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We propose a novel, model-based approach for policy optimization, utilizing a conditional Value-at-Risk based Soft Actor Critic to manage constraints in complex, high-dimensional state spaces effectively. Our method introduces a worst-case actor to guide safe exploration, ensuring rigorous adherence to safety requirements even in unpredictable scenarios. The policy optimization employs the Augmented Lagrangian method and leverages latent diffusion models to predict and simulate future trajectories. This dual approach not only aids in navigating environments safely but also refines the policy's performance by integrating distribution modeling to account for environmental uncertainties. Empirical evaluations conducted in both simulated and real environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The use of self-supervised learning (SSL) to train pathology foundation models has increased substantially in the past few years. Notably, several models trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publicly available in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific research in computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Liao, Tianheng Zheng, Jiayu Zhong, Pingping Zhang, Chao Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, self-supervised denoising methods have gained significant success and become critically important in the field of image restoration. Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets. All the source code will be made available to the public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Jalil Piran, Prathyush P. Poduval, Hamza Errahmouni Barkam, Mohsen Imani, Farhad Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: In-situ sensing, in conjunction with learning models, presents a unique opportunity to address persistent defect issues in Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. However, this integration introduces significant data privacy concerns, such as data leakage, sensor data compromise, and model inversion attacks, revealing critical details about part design, material composition, and machine parameters. Differential Privacy (DP) models, which inject noise into data under mathematical guarantees, offer a nuanced balance between data utility and privacy by obscuring traces of sensing data. However, the introduction of noise into learning models, often functioning as black boxes, complicates the prediction of how specific noise levels impact model accuracy. This study introduces the Differential Privacy-HyperDimensional computing (DP-HD) framework, leveraging the explainability of the vector symbolic paradigm to predict the noise impact on the accuracy of in-situ monitoring, safeguarding sensitive data while maintaining operational efficiency. Experimental results on real-world high-speed melt pool data of AM for detecting overhang anomalies demonstrate that DP-HD achieves superior operational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robust privacy protection, outperforming state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) models. For example, when implementing the same level of privacy protection (with a privacy budget set at 1), our model achieved an accuracy of 94.43%, surpassing the performance of traditional models such as ResNet50 (52.30%), GoogLeNet (23.85%), AlexNet (55.78%), DenseNet201 (69.13%), and EfficientNet B2 (40.81%). Notably, DP-HD maintains high performance under substantial noise additions designed to enhance privacy, unlike current models that suffer significant accuracy declines under high privacy constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Moenne-Loccoz, Ashkan Mirzaei, Or Perel, Riccardo de Lutio, Janick Martinez Esturo, Gavriel State, Sanja Fidler, Nicholas Sharp, Zan Gojcic</p>
<p>Abstract: Particle-based representations of radiance fields such as 3D Gaussian Splatting have found great success for reconstructing and re-rendering of complex scenes. Most existing methods render particles via rasterization, projecting them to screen space tiles for processing in a sorted order. This work instead considers ray tracing the particles, building a bounding volume hierarchy and casting a ray for each pixel using high-performance GPU ray tracing hardware. To efficiently handle large numbers of semi-transparent particles, we describe a specialized rendering algorithm which encapsulates particles with bounding meshes to leverage fast ray-triangle intersections, and shades batches of intersections in depth-order. The benefits of ray tracing are well-known in computer graphics: processing incoherent rays for secondary lighting effects such as shadows and reflections, rendering from highly-distorted cameras common in robotics, stochastically sampling rays, and more. With our renderer, this flexibility comes at little cost compared to rasterization. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision. We further propose related improvements to the basic Gaussian representation, including a simple use of generalized kernel functions which significantly reduces particle hit counts.</p>
