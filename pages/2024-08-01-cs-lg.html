<p><b>Authors:</b> Hetvi Waghela, Jaydip Sen, Sneha Rakshit</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep learning models represent a major threat to the security and reliability of natural language processing (NLP) systems. In this paper, we propose a modification to the BERT-Attack framework, integrating Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to enhance its effectiveness and robustness. The original BERT-Attack, designed for generating adversarial examples against BERT-based models, suffers from limitations such as a fixed perturbation budget and a lack of consideration for semantic similarity. The proposed approach in this work, PGD-BERT-Attack, addresses these limitations by leveraging PGD to iteratively generate adversarial examples while ensuring both imperceptibility and semantic similarity to the original input. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PGD-BERT-Attack compared to the original BERT-Attack and other baseline methods. The results demonstrate that PGD-BERT-Attack achieves higher success rates in causing misclassification while maintaining low perceptual changes. Furthermore, PGD-BERT-Attack produces adversarial instances that exhibit greater semantic resemblance to the initial input, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios. Overall, the proposed modification offers a more effective and robust approach to adversarial attacks on BERT-based models, thus contributing to the advancement of defense against attacks on NLP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaier Liang, Gustavo A. Cardona, Disha Kamale, Cristian-Ioan Vasile</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for inferring timed temporal logic properties from data. The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system traces and corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specific desired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Our proposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer Signal Temporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inference process as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursively generating constraints to determine both data classification and tree structure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms the problem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improved classification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a technique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetry inherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance and interpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classification performance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class, and complex formula classification scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21091">The Stochastic Conjugate Subgradient Algorithm For Kernel Support Vector Machines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Zhang, Suvrajeet Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic First-Order (SFO) methods have been a cornerstone in addressing a broad spectrum of modern machine learning (ML) challenges. However, their efficacy is increasingly questioned, especially in large-scale applications where empirical evidence indicates potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes an innovative method specifically designed for kernel support vector machines (SVMs). This method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also exhibits enhanced scalability when compared to conventional SFO techniques. Diverging from traditional sample average approximation strategies that typically frame kernel SVM as an 'all-in-one' Quadratic Program (QP), our approach adopts adaptive sampling. This strategy incrementally refines approximation accuracy on an 'as-needed' basis. Crucially, this approach also inspires a decomposition-based algorithm, effectively decomposing parameter selection from error estimation, with the latter being independently determined for each data point. To exploit the quadratic nature of the kernel matrix, we introduce a stochastic conjugate subgradient method. This method preserves many benefits of first-order approaches while adeptly handling both nonlinearity and non-smooth aspects of the SVM problem. Thus, it extends beyond the capabilities of standard SFO algorithms for non-smooth convex optimization. The convergence rate of this novel method is thoroughly analyzed within this paper. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only maintains but potentially exceeds the scalability of SFO methods. Moreover, it significantly enhances both speed and accuracy of the optimization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago Novello, Diana Aldana, Luiz Velho</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates the structure and representation capacity of $sinusoidal$ MLPs, which have recently shown promising results in encoding low-dimensional signals. This success can be attributed to its smoothness and high representation capacity. The first allows the use of the network's derivatives during training, enabling regularization. However, defining the architecture and initializing its parameters to achieve a desired capacity remains an empirical task. This work provides theoretical and experimental results justifying the capacity property of sinusoidal MLPs and offers control mechanisms for their initialization and training.
  We approach this from a Fourier series perspective and link the training with the model's spectrum. Our analysis is based on a $harmonic$ expansion of the sinusoidal MLP, which says that the composition of sinusoidal layers produces a large number of new frequencies expressed as integer linear combinations of the input frequencies (weights of the input layer). We use this novel $identity$ to initialize the input neurons which work as a sampling in the signal spectrum. We also note that each hidden neuron produces the same frequencies with amplitudes completely determined by the hidden weights. Finally, we give an upper bound for these amplitudes, which results in a $bounding$ scheme for the network's spectrum during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawel Renc, Yugang Jia, Anthony E. Samir, Jaroslaw Was, Quanzheng Li, David W. Bates, Arkadiusz Sitek</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating modern machine learning and clinical decision-making has great promise for mitigating healthcare's increasing cost and complexity. We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitri Tymoczko, Mark Newman</p>
<p>Abstract: We use coupled hidden Markov models to automatically annotate the 371 Bach chorales in the Riemenschneider edition, a corpus containing approximately 100,000 notes and 20,000 chords. We give three separate analyses that achieve progressively greater accuracy at the cost of making increasingly strong assumptions about musical syntax. Although our method makes almost no use of human input, we are able to identify both chords and keys with an accuracy of 85% or greater when compared to an expert human analysis, resulting in annotations accurate enough to be used for a range of music-theoretical purposes, while also being free of subjective human judgments. Our work bears on longstanding debates about the objective reality of the structures postulated by standard Western harmonic theory, as well as on specific questions about the nature of Western harmonic syntax.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selim F. Yilmaz, Burak Hasircioglu, Li Qiao, Deniz Gunduz</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider collaborative inference at the wireless edge, where each client's model is trained independently on their local datasets. Clients are queried in parallel to make an accurate decision collaboratively. In addition to maximizing the inference accuracy, we also want to ensure the privacy of local models. To this end, we leverage the superposition property of the multiple access channel to implement bandwidth-efficient multi-user inference methods. Specifically, we propose different methods for ensemble and multi-view classification that exploit over-the-air computation. We show that these schemes perform better than their orthogonal counterparts with statistically significant differences while using fewer resources and providing privacy guarantees. We also provide experimental results verifying the benefits of the proposed over-the-air multi-user inference approach and perform an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices. We share the source code of the framework publicly on Github to facilitate further research and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack He, Jianxing Zhao, Andrew Bai, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models have become cornerstone technologies, driving innovation in diverse fields from art creation to healthcare. Despite their potential, these models face the significant challenge of data memorization, which poses risks to privacy and the integrity of generated content. Among various metrics of memorization detection, our study delves into the memorization scores calculated from encoder layer embeddings, which involves measuring distances between samples in the embedding spaces. Particularly, we find that the memorization scores calculated from layer embeddings of Vision Transformers (ViTs) show an notable trend - the latter (deeper) the layer, the less the memorization measured. It has been found that the memorization scores from the early layers' embeddings are more sensitive to low-level memorization (e.g. colors and simple patterns for an image), while those from the latter layers are more sensitive to high-level memorization (e.g. semantic meaning of an image). We also observe that, for a specific model architecture, its degree of memorization on different levels of information is unique. It can be viewed as an inherent property of the architecture. Building upon this insight, we introduce a unique fingerprinting methodology. This method capitalizes on the unique distributions of the memorization score across different layers of ViTs, providing a novel approach to identifying models involved in generating deepfakes and malicious content. Our approach demonstrates a marked 30% enhancement in identification accuracy over existing baseline methods, offering a more effective tool for combating digital misinformation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21176">DKL-KAN: Scalable Deep Kernel Learning using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrenik Zinage, Sudeepta Mondal, Soumalya Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: The need for scalable and expressive models in machine learning is paramount, particularly in applications requiring both structural depth and flexibility. Traditional deep learning methods, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLP), offer depth but lack ability to integrate structural characteristics of deep learning architectures with non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. To address this, deep kernel learning (DKL) was introduced, where inputs to a base kernel are transformed using a deep learning architecture. These kernels can replace standard kernels, allowing both expressive power and scalability. The advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has generated considerable attention and discussion among researchers in scientific domain. In this paper, we introduce a scalable deep kernel using KAN (DKL-KAN) as an effective alternative to DKL using MLP (DKL-MLP). Our approach involves simultaneously optimizing these kernel attributes using marginal likelihood within a Gaussian process framework. We analyze two variants of DKL-KAN for a fair comparison with DKL-MLP: one with same number of neurons and layers as DKL-MLP, and another with approximately same number of trainable parameters. To handle large datasets, we use kernel interpolation for scalable structured Gaussian processes (KISS-GP) for low-dimensional inputs and KISS-GP with product kernels for high-dimensional inputs. The efficacy of DKL-KAN is evaluated in terms of computational training time and test prediction accuracy across a wide range of applications. Additionally, the effectiveness of DKL-KAN is also examined in modeling discontinuities and accurately estimating prediction uncertainty. The results indicate that DKL-KAN outperforms DKL-MLP on datasets with a low number of observations. Conversely, DKL-MLP exhibits better scalability and higher test prediction accuracy on datasets with large number of observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ingrid Navarro, Pablo Ortega-Kral, Jay Patrikar, Haichuan Wang, Zelin Ye, Jong Hoon Park, Jean Oh, Sebastian Scherer</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for air travel requires technological advancements in air traffic management as well as mechanisms for monitoring and ensuring safe and efficient operations. In terminal airspaces, predictive models of future movements and traffic flows can help with proactive planning and efficient coordination; however, varying airport topologies, and interactions with other agents, among other factors, make accurate predictions challenging. Data-driven predictive models have shown promise for handling numerous variables to enable various downstream tasks, including collision risk assessment, taxi-out time prediction, departure metering, and emission estimations. While data-driven methods have shown improvements in these tasks, prior works lack large-scale curated surface movement datasets within the public domain and the development of generalizable trajectory forecasting models. In response to this, we propose two contributions: (1) Amelia-48, a large surface movement dataset collected using the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Surface Movement Event Service (SMES). With data collection beginning in Dec 2022, the dataset provides more than a year's worth of SMES data (~30TB) and covers 48 airports within the US National Airspace System. In addition to releasing this data in the public domain, we also provide post-processing scripts and associated airport maps to enable research in the forecasting domain and beyond. (2) Amelia-TF model, a transformer-based next-token-prediction large multi-agent multi-airport trajectory forecasting model trained on 292 days or 9.4 billion tokens of position data encompassing 10 different airports with varying topology. The open-sourced model is validated on unseen airports with experiments showcasing the different prediction horizon lengths, ego-agent selection strategies, and training recipes to demonstrate the generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan D. McCart, Andrew R. Sedler, Christopher Versteeg, Domenick Mifsud, Mattia Rigotti-Thompson, Chethan Pandarinath</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in recording technology have allowed neuroscientists to monitor activity from thousands of neurons simultaneously. Latent variable models are increasingly valuable for distilling these recordings into compact and interpretable representations. Here we propose a new approach to neural data analysis that leverages advances in conditional generative modeling to enable the unsupervised inference of disentangled behavioral variables from recorded neural activity. Our approach builds on InfoDiffusion, which augments diffusion models with a set of latent variables that capture important factors of variation in the data. We apply our model, called Generating Neural Observations Conditioned on Codes with High Information (GNOCCHI), to time series neural data and test its application to synthetic and biological recordings of neural activity during reaching. In comparison to a VAE-based sequential autoencoder, GNOCCHI learns higher-quality latent spaces that are more clearly structured and more disentangled with respect to key behavioral variables. These properties enable accurate generation of novel samples (unseen behavioral conditions) through simple linear traversal of the latent spaces produced by GNOCCHI. Our work demonstrates the potential of unsupervised, information-based models for the discovery of interpretable latent spaces from neural data, enabling researchers to generate high-quality samples from unseen conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khemraj Shukla, Zongren Zou, Chi Hin Chan, Additi Pandey, Zhicheng Wang, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiphysics problems that are characterized by complex interactions among fluid dynamics, heat transfer, structural mechanics, and electromagnetics, are inherently challenging due to their coupled nature. While experimental data on certain state variables may be available, integrating these data with numerical solvers remains a significant challenge. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising results in various engineering disciplines, particularly in handling noisy data and solving inverse problems. However, their effectiveness in forecasting nonlinear phenomena in multiphysics regimes is yet to be fully established. This study introduces NeuroSEM, a hybrid framework integrating PINNs with the high-fidelity Spectral Element Method (SEM) solver, Nektar++. NeuroSEM leverages strengths of both PINNs and SEM, providing robust solutions for multiphysics problems. PINNs are trained to assimilate data and model physical phenomena in specific subdomains, which are then integrated into Nektar++. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of NeuroSEM for thermal convection in cavity flow and flow past a cylinder. The framework effectively handles data assimilation by addressing those subdomains and state variables where data are available. We applied NeuroSEM to the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system, including cases with missing thermal boundary conditions. Our results indicate that NeuroSEM accurately models the physical phenomena and assimilates the data within the specified subdomains. The framework's plug-and-play nature facilitates its extension to other multiphysics or multiscale problems. Furthermore, NeuroSEM is optimized for an efficient execution on emerging integrated GPU-CPU architectures. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex engineering challenges in various scientific domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Learning using neural networks has received prominent attention recently because of its success in solving a wide variety of computational tasks, in particular in the field of computer vision. However, several works have drawn attention to potential security risks involved with the training and implementation of such networks. In this work, we introduce DeepBaR, a novel approach that implants backdoors on neural networks by faulting their behavior at training, especially during fine-tuning. Our technique aims to generate adversarial samples by optimizing a custom loss function that mimics the implanted backdoors while adding an almost non-visible trigger in the image. We attack three popular convolutional neural network architectures and show that DeepBaR attacks have a success rate of up to 98.30\%. Furthermore, DeepBaR does not significantly affect the accuracy of the attacked networks after deployment when non-malicious inputs are given. Remarkably, DeepBaR allows attackers to choose an input that looks similar to a given class, from a human perspective, but that will be classified as belonging to an arbitrary target class.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihee You, So Won Jeong, Claire Donnat</p>
<p>Abstract: With the proliferation of Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods stemming from contrastive learning, unsupervised node representation learning for graph data is rapidly gaining traction across various fields, from biology to molecular dynamics, where it is often used as a dimensionality reduction tool. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the quality of the low-dimensional node representations these methods produce, particularly beyond well-curated academic datasets. To address this gap, we propose here the first comprehensive benchmarking of various unsupervised node embedding techniques tailored for dimensionality reduction, encompassing a range of manifold learning tasks, along with various performance metrics. We emphasize the sensitivity of current methods to hyperparameter choices -- highlighting a fundamental issue as to their applicability in real-world settings where there is no established methodology for rigorous hyperparameter selection. Addressing this issue, we introduce GNUMAP, a robust and parameter-free method for unsupervised node representation learning that merges the traditional UMAP approach with the expressivity of the GNN framework. We show that GNUMAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN embedding methods in a variety of contexts, including synthetic geometric datasets, citation networks, and real-world biomedical data -- making it a simple but reliable dimensionality reduction tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiu Zhao, Jiaxin Shi, Lester Mackey, Scott Linderman</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion modeling is a promising framework for modeling and generating data in discrete spaces. To sample from these models, different strategies present trade-offs between computation and sample quality. A predominant sampling strategy is predictor-corrector $\tau$-leaping, which simulates the continuous time generative process with discretized predictor steps and counteracts the accumulation of discretization error via corrector steps. However, for absorbing state diffusion, an important class of discrete diffusion models, the standard forward-backward corrector can be ineffective in fixing such errors, resulting in subpar sample quality. To remedy this problem, we propose a family of informed correctors that more reliably counteracts discretization error by leveraging information learned by the model. For further efficiency gains, we also propose $k$-Gillespie's, a sampling algorithm that better utilizes each model evaluation, while still enjoying the speed and flexibility of $\tau$-leaping. Across several real and synthetic datasets, we show that $k$-Gillespie's with informed correctors reliably produces higher quality samples at lower computational cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by effectively capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In this paper, we present a regret analysis for distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of Bellman unbiasedness for a tractable and exactly learnable update via statistical functional dynamic programming. Our theoretical results show that approximating the infinite-dimensional return distribution with a finite number of moment functionals is the only method to learn the statistical information unbiasedly, including nonlinear statistical functionals. Second, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaoxuan Li, Chern Hong Lim, Qiyao Ma, Xinyu Tang, Hwa Hui Tew</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research in the field of Human Activity Recognition has shown that an improvement in prediction performance can be achieved by reducing the number of LSTM layers. However, this kind of enhancement is only significant on monolithic architectures, and when it runs on large-scale distributed training, data security and privacy issues will be reconsidered, and its prediction performance is unknown. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework: FedBChain, which integrates the federated learning paradigm based on a modified DeepConvLSTM architecture with a single LSTM layer. This framework performs comparative tests of prediction performance on three different real-world datasets based on three different hidden layer units (128, 256, and 512) combined with five different federated learning strategies, respectively. The results show that our architecture has significant improvements in Precision, Recall and F1-score compared to the centralized training approach on all datasets with all hidden layer units for all strategies: FedAvg strategy improves on average by 4.54%, FedProx improves on average by 4.57%, FedTrimmedAvg improves on average by 4.35%, Krum improves by 4.18% on average, and FedAvgM improves by 4.46% on average. Based on our results, it can be seen that FedBChain not only improves in performance, but also guarantees the security and privacy of user data compared to centralized training methods during the training process. The code for our experiments is publicly available (https://github.com/Glen909/FedBChain).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Melkani, Xiangyang Ju</p>
<p>Abstract: Track finding in particle data is a challenging pattern recognition problem in High Energy Physics. It takes as inputs a point cloud of space points and labels them so that space points created by the same particle have the same label. The list of space points with the same label is a track candidate. We argue that this pattern recognition problem can be formulated as a sorting problem, of which the inputs are a list of space points sorted by their distances away from the collision points and the outputs are the space points sorted by their labels. In this paper, we propose the TrackSorter algorithm: a Transformer-based algorithm for pattern recognition in particle data. TrackSorter uses a simple tokenization scheme to convert space points into discrete tokens. It then uses the tokenized space points as inputs and sorts the input tokens into track candidates. TrackSorter is a novel end-to-end track finding algorithm that leverages Transformer-based models to solve pattern recognition problems. It is evaluated on the TrackML dataset and has good track finding performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Wu, Yu Pan, Fuqi Zhou, Jinghui Yan, Chuanlu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Persistent homology is an effective method for extracting topological information, represented as persistent diagrams, of spatial structure data. Hence it is well-suited for the study of protein structures. Attempts to incorporate Persistent homology in machine learning methods of protein function prediction have resulted in several techniques for vectorizing persistent diagrams. However, current vectorization methods are excessively artificial and cannot ensure the effective utilization of information or the rationality of the methods. To address this problem, we propose a more geometrical vectorization method of persistent diagrams based on maximal margin classification for Banach space, and additionaly propose a framework that utilizes topological data analysis to identify proteins with specific functions. We evaluated our vectorization method using a binary classification task on proteins and compared it with the statistical methods that exhibit the best performance among thirteen commonly used vectorization methods. The experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the statistical methods in both robustness and precision.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data assimilation has become a crucial technique aiming to combine physical models with observational data to estimate state variables. Traditional assimilation algorithms often face challenges of high nonlinearity brought by both the physical and observational models. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven assimilation algorithm based on generative models to address such concerns. Our State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is designed to handle nonlinear physical and observational models more effectively. The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the real posterior under mild assumptions, which shows theoretical superiority over previous score-based assimilation works. Experimental results also indicate that our SOAD model may offer improved accuracy over existing data-driven methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulai Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperation plays a pivotal role in the evolution of human intelligence; moreover, it also underlies the recent revolutionary advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) that is driven by foundation models. Specifically, we reveal that the training of foundation models can be interpreted as a form of big cooperative learning (\textit{abbr.} big learning), where massive learning individuals/tasks \emph{cooperate} to approach the unique essence of data from diverse perspectives of data prediction, leveraging a universal model. The presented big learning therefore unifies most training objectives of foundation models within a consistent framework, where their underlying assumptions are exposed simultaneously. We design tailored simulations to demonstrate the principle of big learning, based on which we provide learning-perspective justifications for the successes of foundation models, with interesting side-products. Furthermore, we reveal that big learning is a new dimension for upgrading conventional machine learning paradigms, valuable for endowing reinvigorations to associated applications; as an illustrative example, we propose the BigLearn-GAN, which is a novel adversarially-trained foundation model with versatile data sampling capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Zagardo</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) introduces statistical noise on top of gradients drawn from a Gaussian distribution to ensure privacy. This paper introduces the novel Differentially Private Block-wise Gradient Shuffle (DP-BloGS) algorithm for deep learning. BloGS builds off of existing private deep learning literature, but makes a definitive shift by taking a probabilistic approach to gradient noise introduction through shuffling modeled after information theoretic privacy analyses. The theoretical results presented in this paper show that the combination of shuffling, parameter-specific block size selection, batch layer clipping, and gradient accumulation allows DP-BloGS to achieve training times close to that of non-private training while maintaining similar privacy and utility guarantees to DP-SGD. DP-BloGS is found to be significantly more resistant to data extraction attempts than DP-SGD. The theoretical results are validated by the experimental findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangliang Liu, Yi Guan, BoRan Wang, Rujia Shen, Yi Lin, Chaoran Kong, Lian Yan, Jingchi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Imagining potential outcomes of actions before execution helps agents make more informed decisions, a prospective thinking ability fundamental to human cognition. However, mainstream model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods lack the ability to proactively envision future scenarios, plan, and guide strategies. These methods typically rely on trial and error to adjust policy functions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards or long-term value, even if such high-reward decisions place the environment in extremely dangerous states. To address this, we propose the Prospective (ProSpec) RL method, which makes higher-value, lower-risk optimal decisions by imagining future n-stream trajectories. Specifically, ProSpec employs a dynamic model to predict future states (termed "imagined states") based on the current state and a series of sampled actions. Furthermore, we integrate the concept of Model Predictive Control and introduce a cycle consistency constraint that allows the agent to evaluate and select the optimal actions from these trajectories. Moreover, ProSpec employs cycle consistency to mitigate two fundamental issues in RL: augmenting state reversibility to avoid irreversible events (low risk) and augmenting actions to generate numerous virtual trajectories, thereby improving data efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the DMControl benchmarks, where our approach achieved significant performance improvements. Code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Mu, Linquan Wei, Yi Liu, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many artificial intelligence models process input data of different lengths and resolutions, making the shape of the tensors dynamic. The performance of these models depends on the shape of the tensors, which makes it difficult to optimize the tensors before the model runs. There are two common solutions to this problem. The first is to add useless data to the input to match a pre-optimized tensor library. The second is to use small basic tensors to create a tensor that is closest in size to the input data and then tune it to minimize padding. However, this second solution can be time-consuming.
  This paper proposes a new technique for deep learning compilers called FTuner. Instead of using a large design space or training a cost model, we use an abstract computational unit called the uKernel to patch together small, various-sized tensors to match the shape of the input tensor. We determine the shape of the uKernel using an analytic hardware information model. Experiments show that the FTuner can achieve comparable operators and end-to-end performance to vendor libraries and achieves 3\% speedup on existing auto-tuner with the model-training compiler while reducing tuning time by two orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring biodiversity at scale is challenging. Detecting and identifying species in fine grained taxonomies requires highly accurate machine learning (ML) methods. Training such models requires large high quality data sets. And deploying these models to low power devices requires novel compression techniques and model architectures. While species classification methods have profited from novel data sets and advances in ML methods, in particular neural networks, deploying these state of the art models to low power devices remains difficult. Here we present a comprehensive empirical comparison of various tinyML neural network architectures and compression techniques for species classification. We focus on the example of bird song detection, more concretely a data set curated for studying the corn bunting bird species. The data set is released along with all code and experiments of this study. In our experiments we compare predictive performance, memory and time complexity of classical spectrogram based methods and recent approaches operating on raw audio signal. Our results indicate that individual bird species can be robustly detected with relatively simple architectures that can be readily deployed to low power devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Gram, Brandon K. Sai, Thomas Bauernhansl</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving landscape of automation and manufacturing systems, the efficient resolution of productivity losses is paramount. This study introduces a data-driven ensemble approach, utilizing the cyclic multivariate time series data from binary sensors and signals from Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) within these systems. The objective is to automatically analyze productivity losses per cycle and pinpoint their root causes by assigning the loss to a system element. The ensemble approach introduced in this publication integrates various methods, including information theory and machine learning behavior models, to provide a robust analysis for each production cycle. To expedite the resolution of productivity losses and ensure short response times, stream processing becomes a necessity. Addressing this, the approach is implemented as data-stream analysis and can be transferred to batch processing, seamlessly integrating into existing systems without the need for extensive historical data analysis. This method has two positive effects. Firstly, the result of the analysis ensures that the period of lower productivity is reduced by identifying the likely root cause of the productivity loss. Secondly, these results are more reliable due to the ensemble approach and therefore avoid dependency on technical experts. The approach is validated using a semi-automated welding manufacturing system, an injection molding automation system, and a synthetically generated test PLC dataset. The results demonstrate the method's efficacy in offering a data-driven understanding of process behavior and mark an advancement in autonomous manufacturing system analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxi Cui, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou, Gang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) on tabular data is ubiquitous, yet obtaining abundant high-quality tabular data for model training remains a significant obstacle. Numerous works have focused on tabular data augmentation (TDA) to enhance the original table with additional data, thereby improving downstream ML tasks. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging the capabilities of generative AI for TDA. Therefore, we believe it is time to provide a comprehensive review of the progress and future prospects of TDA, with a particular emphasis on the trending generative AI. Specifically, we present an architectural view of the TDA pipeline, comprising three main procedures: pre-augmentation, augmentation, and post-augmentation. Pre-augmentation encompasses preparation tasks that facilitate subsequent TDA, including error handling, table annotation, table simplification, table representation, table indexing, table navigation, schema matching, and entity matching. Augmentation systematically analyzes current TDA methods, categorized into retrieval-based methods, which retrieve external data, and generation-based methods, which generate synthetic data. We further subdivide these methods based on the granularity of the augmentation process at the row, column, cell, and table levels. Post-augmentation focuses on the datasets, evaluation and optimization aspects of TDA. We also summarize current trends and future directions for TDA, highlighting promising opportunities in the era of generative AI. In addition, the accompanying papers and related resources are continuously updated and maintained in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/awesome-tabular-data-augmentation to reflect ongoing advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Hanselle, Stefan Heid, Johannes F\"urnkranz, Eyke H\"ullermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: A scoring system is a simple decision model that checks a set of features, adds a certain number of points to a total score for each feature that is satisfied, and finally makes a decision by comparing the total score to a threshold. Scoring systems have a long history of active use in safety-critical domains such as healthcare and justice, where they provide guidance for making objective and accurate decisions. Given their genuine interpretability, the idea of learning scoring systems from data is obviously appealing from the perspective of explainable AI. In this paper, we propose a practically motivated extension of scoring systems called probabilistic scoring lists (PSL), as well as a method for learning PSLs from data. Instead of making a deterministic decision, a PSL represents uncertainty in the form of probability distributions, or, more generally, probability intervals. Moreover, in the spirit of decision lists, a PSL evaluates features one by one and stops as soon as a decision can be made with enough confidence. To evaluate our approach, we conduct a case study in the medical domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the successes and progress of deep reinforcement learning over the last decade, several challenges remain that hinder its broader application. Some fundamental aspects to improve include data efficiency, generalization capability, and ability to learn in sparse-reward environments, which often require human-designed dense rewards. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these issues by optimizing components of the learning algorithm to meet desired characteristics. Additionally, a different line of work has extensively studied the use of intrinsic rewards to enhance the exploration capabilities of algorithms. This work investigates how meta-learning can improve the training signal received by RL agents. The focus is on meta-learning intrinsic rewards under a framework that doesn't rely on the use of meta-gradients. We analyze and compare this approach to the use of extrinsic rewards and a meta-learned advantage function. The developed algorithms are evaluated on distributions of continuous control tasks with both parametric and non-parametric variations, and with only sparse rewards accessible for the evaluation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Customer Experience (CX) Simulator, a novel framework designed to assess the effects of untested web-marketing campaigns through user behavior simulations. The proposed framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to represent various events in a user's behavioral history, such as viewing an item, applying a coupon, or purchasing an item, as semantic embedding vectors. We train a model to predict transitions between events from their LLM embeddings, which can even generalize to unseen events by learning from diverse training data. In web-marketing applications, we leverage this transition prediction model to simulate how users might react differently when new campaigns or products are presented to them. This allows us to eliminate the need for costly online testing and enhance the marketers' abilities to reveal insights. Our numerical evaluation and user study, utilizing BigQuery Public Datasets from the Google Merchandise Store, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven N. Hart, Thomas E. Tavolara</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised embeddings are fundamental to numerous machine learning applications, yet their evaluation remains a challenging task. Traditional assessment methods often rely on extrinsic variables, such as performance in downstream tasks, which can introduce confounding factors and mask the true quality of embeddings. This paper introduces the Intrinsic Distance Preservation Evaluation (IDPE) method, a novel approach for assessing embedding quality based on the preservation of Mahalanobis distances between data points in the original and embedded spaces. We demonstrate the limitations of extrinsic evaluation methods through a simple example, highlighting how they can lead to misleading conclusions about embedding quality. IDPE addresses these issues by providing a task-independent measure of how well embeddings preserve the intrinsic structure of the original data. Our method leverages efficient similarity search techniques to make it applicable to large-scale datasets. We compare IDPE with established intrinsic metrics like trustworthiness and continuity, as well as extrinsic metrics such as Average Rank and Mean Reciprocal Rank. Our results show that IDPE offers a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of embedding quality across various scenarios. We evaluate PCA and t-SNE embeddings using IDPE, revealing insights into their performance that are not captured by traditional metrics. This work contributes to the field by providing a robust, efficient, and interpretable method for embedding evaluation. IDPE's focus on intrinsic properties offers a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop and assess high-quality embeddings for diverse machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinamr Jain, Romit Maulik</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting dynamical systems is of importance to numerous real-world applications. When possible, dynamical systems forecasts are constructed based on first-principles-based models such as through the use of differential equations. When these equations are unknown, non-intrusive techniques must be utilized to build predictive models from data alone. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been used for such tasks. Moreover, ML methods provide the added advantage of significant reductions in time-to-solution for predictions in contrast with first-principle based models. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based methods for forecasting rely on neural networks, which may be expensive to train and necessitate requirements for large amounts of memory. In this work, we propose a quantum mechanics inspired ML modeling strategy for learning nonlinear dynamical systems that provides data-driven forecasts for complex dynamical systems with reduced training time and memory costs. This approach, denoted the quantum reservoir computing technique (QRC), is a hybrid quantum-classical framework employing an ensemble of interconnected small quantum systems via classical linear feedback connections. By mapping the dynamical state to a suitable quantum representation amenable to unitary operations, QRC is able to predict complex nonlinear dynamical systems in a stable and accurate manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through benchmark forecasts of the NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset and compare the performance of QRC to other ML methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongju Lee, Junseok Lee, Yeonguk Yu, Taeri Kim, Kyoobin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial to autonomous driving and understanding the surrounding environment. Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

We explain here theoretically why the Lyapunov exponents give actionable insights and propose a weighting scheme to automatically adapt to chaotic, periodic or stable dynamics.

<p>Abstract: Neural Networks are notoriously difficult to inspect. We introduce comgra, an open source python library for use with PyTorch. Comgra extracts data about the internal activations of a model and organizes it in a GUI (graphical user interface). It can show both summary statistics and individual data points, compare early and late stages of training, focus on individual samples of interest, and visualize the flow of the gradient through the network. This makes it possible to inspect the model's behavior from many different angles and save time by rapidly testing different hypotheses without having to rerun it. Comgra has applications for debugging, neural architecture design, and mechanistic interpretability. We publish our library through Python Package Index (PyPI) and provide code, documentation, and tutorials at https://github.com/FlorianDietz/comgra.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan hillier, Cheston Tan, Jing Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Social learning plays an important role in the development of human intelligence. As children, we imitate our parents' speech patterns until we are able to produce sounds; we learn from them praising us and scolding us; and as adults, we learn by working with others. In this work, we survey the degree to which this paradigm -- social learning -- has been mirrored in machine learning. In particular, since learning socially requires interacting with others, we are interested in how embodied agents can and have utilised these techniques. This is especially in light of the degree to which recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) enable us to perform new forms of social learning. We look at how behavioural cloning and next-token prediction mirror human imitation, how learning from human feedback mirrors human education, and how we can go further to enable fully communicative agents that learn from each other. We find that while individual social learning techniques have been used successfully, there has been little unifying work showing how to bring them together into socially embodied agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Duan, Tiansheng Wen, Yifei Wang, Chen Zhu, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Factor analysis, often regarded as a Bayesian variant of matrix factorization, offers superior capabilities in capturing uncertainty, modeling complex dependencies, and ensuring robustness. As the deep learning era arrives, factor analysis is receiving less and less attention due to their limited expressive ability. On the contrary, contrastive learning has emerged as a potent technique with demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised representational learning. While the two methods are different paradigms, recent theoretical analysis has revealed the mathematical equivalence between contrastive learning and matrix factorization, providing a potential possibility for factor analysis combined with contrastive learning. Motivated by the interconnectedness of contrastive learning, matrix factorization, and factor analysis, this paper introduces a novel Contrastive Factor Analysis framework, aiming to leverage factor analysis's advantageous properties within the realm of contrastive learning. To further leverage the interpretability properties of non-negative factor analysis, which can learn disentangled representations, contrastive factor analysis is extended to a non-negative version. Finally, extensive experimental validation showcases the efficacy of the proposed contrastive (non-negative) factor analysis methodology across multiple key properties, including expressiveness, robustness, interpretability, and accurate uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei He, Qianqian Xu, Yangbangyan Jiang, Zitai Wang, Yuchen Sun, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the progressive advancements in deep graph learning, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for graph data has emerged as a critical challenge. While the efficacy of auxiliary datasets in enhancing OOD detection has been extensively studied for image and text data, such approaches have not yet been explored for graph data. Unlike Euclidean data, graph data exhibits greater diversity but lower robustness to perturbations, complicating the integration of outliers. To tackle these challenges, we propose the introduction of \textbf{H}ybrid External and Internal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}utlier \textbf{E}xposure (HGOE) to improve graph OOD detection performance. Our framework involves using realistic external graph data from various domains and synthesizing internal outliers within ID subgroups to address the poor robustness and presence of OOD samples within the ID class. Furthermore, we develop a boundary-aware OE loss that adaptively assigns weights to outliers, maximizing the use of high-quality OOD samples while minimizing the impact of low-quality ones. Our proposed HGOE framework is model-agnostic and designed to enhance the effectiveness of existing graph OOD detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that our HGOE framework can significantly improve the performance of existing OOD detection models across all 8 real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley Brown, Jordan Juravsky, Ryan Ehrlich, Ronald Clark, Quoc V. Le, Christopher R\'e, Azalia Mirhoseini</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of generated samples. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage - the fraction of problems solved by any attempt - scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43% which uses more capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing, amplifying the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is more cost-effective and solves more issues than paying a premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Finally, we find that identifying correct samples out of many generations remains an important direction for future research in domains without automatic verifiers. When solving math word problems from GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models grows to over 95% with 10,000 samples. However, common methods to pick correct solutions from a sample collection, such as majority voting or reward models, plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities, potentially enabling "safetywashing" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Chen, Siyuan Tang, Rui Zhu, Shijun Yan, Lei Jin, Zihao Wang, Liya Su, Zhikun Zhang, XiaoFeng Wang, Haixu Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) have raised public concerns about the privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) within their extensive training datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, our analysis validates that existing fine-tuning APIs provided by OpenAI and Azure AI Studio are susceptible to our Janus attack, allowing an adversary to conduct such an attack at a low cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikil Sharan Prabahar Balasubramanian, Sagnik Dakshit</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have generated a large-scale interest in the development of foundational deep learning models. The development of Large Language Models (LLM) has evolved as a transformative paradigm in conversational tasks, which has led to its integration and extension even in the critical domain of healthcare. With LLMs becoming widely popular and their public access through open-source models and integration with other applications, there is a need to investigate their potential and limitations. One such crucial task where LLMs are applied but require a deeper understanding is that of self-diagnosis of medical conditions based on bias-validating symptoms in the interest of public health. The widespread integration of Gemini with Google search and GPT-4.0 with Bing search has led to a shift in the trend of self-diagnosis using search engines to conversational LLM models. Owing to the critical nature of the task, it is prudent to investigate and understand the potential and limitations of public LLMs in the task of self-diagnosis. In this study, we prepare a prompt engineered dataset of 10000 samples and test the performance on the general task of self-diagnosis. We compared the performance of both the state-of-the-art GPT-4.0 and the fee Gemini model on the task of self-diagnosis and recorded contrasting accuracies of 63.07% and 6.01%, respectively. We also discuss the challenges, limitations, and potential of both Gemini and GPT-4.0 for the task of self-diagnosis to facilitate future research and towards the broader impact of general public knowledge. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential and improvement in performance for the task of self-diagnosis using Retrieval Augmented Generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zheng, Zihan Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper establishes a new and comprehensive theoretical analysis for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in high-frequency market making. We bridge the modern RL theory and the continuous-time statistical models in high-frequency financial economics. Different with most existing literature on methodological research about developing various RL methods for market making problem, our work is a pilot to provide the theoretical analysis. We target the effects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between error and complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment $\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but the complexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under the general-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium to the continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$. The Nash Q-learning algorithm, which is an online multi-agent RL method, is applied to solve the equilibrium. Our theories are not only useful for practitioners to choose the sampling frequency, but also very general and applicable to other high-frequency financial decision making problems, e.g., optimal executions, as long as the time-discretization of a continuous-time markov decision process is adopted. Monte Carlo simulation evidence support all of our theories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in accelerating drug design. Active ML-guided optimization of therapeutic molecules typically relies on a surrogate model predicting the target property of interest. The model predictions are used to determine which designs to evaluate in the lab, and the model is updated on the new measurements to inform the next cycle of decisions. A key challenge is that the experimental feedback from each cycle inspires changes in the candidate proposal or experimental protocol for the next cycle, which lead to distribution shifts. To promote robustness to these shifts, we must account for them explicitly in the model training. We apply domain generalization (DG) methods to classify the stability of interactions between an antibody and antigen across five domains defined by design cycles. Our results suggest that foundational models and ensembling improve predictive performance on out-of-distribution domains. We publicly release our codebase extending the DG benchmark ``DomainBed,'' and the associated dataset of antibody sequences and structures emulating distribution shifts across design cycles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Sch\"on, Shammakh Naseer, Ben Wooding, Sadegh Soudjani</p>
<p>Abstract: To advance formal verification of stochastic systems against temporal logic requirements for handling unknown dynamics, researchers have been designing data-driven approaches inspired by breakthroughs in the underlying machine learning techniques. As one promising research direction, abstraction-based solutions based on Gaussian process (GP) regression have become popular for their ability to learn a representation of the latent system from data with a quantified error. Results obtained based on this model are then translated to the true system via various methods. In a recent publication, GPs using a so-called binary-tree kernel have demonstrated a polynomial speedup w.r.t. the size of the data compared to their vanilla version, outcompeting all existing sparse GP approximations. Incidentally, the resulting binary-tree Gaussian process (BTGP) is characteristic for its piecewise-constant posterior mean and covariance functions, naturally abstracting the input space into discrete partitions. In this paper, we leverage this natural abstraction of the BTGP for formal verification, eliminating the need for cumbersome abstraction and error quantification procedures. We show that the BTGP allows us to construct an interval Markov chain model of the unknown system with a speedup that is polynomial w.r.t. the size of the abstraction compared to alternative approaches. We provide a delocalized error quantification via a unified formula even when the true dynamics do not live in the function space of the BTGP. This allows us to compute upper and lower bounds on the probability of satisfying reachability specifications that are robust to both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper approaches the problem of separating the notes from a quantized symbolic music piece (e.g., a MIDI file) into multiple voices and staves. This is a fundamental part of the larger task of music score engraving (or score typesetting), which aims to produce readable musical scores for human performers. We focus on piano music and support homophonic voices, i.e., voices that can contain chords, and cross-staff voices, which are notably difficult tasks that have often been overlooked in previous research. We propose an end-to-end system based on graph neural networks that clusters notes that belong to the same chord and connects them with edges if they are part of a voice. Our results show clear and consistent improvements over a previous approach on two datasets of different styles. To aid the qualitative analysis of our results, we support the export in symbolic music formats and provide a direct visualization of our outputs graph over the musical score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sixiao Zhang, Cheng Long, Wei Yuan, Hongxu Chen, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems embody significant commercial value and represent crucial intellectual property. However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, healthcare professionals are increasingly emphasizing on personalized and evidence-based patient care through the exploration of prognostic pathways. To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement. This empowers healthcare providers to implement more personalized and effective healthcare strategies for individual patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Feng, Zhen Tian, Yifan Zhu, Zongfu Han, Haoran Luo, Guangwei Zhang, Meina Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The key challenge of cross-modal domain-incremental learning (DIL) is to enable the learning model to continuously learn from novel data with different feature distributions under the same task without forgetting old ones. However, existing top-performing methods still cause high forgetting rates, by lacking intra-domain knowledge extraction and inter-domain common prompting strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CP-Prompt, by training limited parameters to instruct a pre-trained model to learn new domains and avoid forgetting existing feature distributions. CP-Prompt captures intra-domain knowledge by compositionally inserting personalized prompts on multi-head self-attention layers and then learns the inter-domain knowledge with a common prompting strategy. CP-Prompt shows superiority compared with state-of-the-art baselines among three widely evaluated DIL tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/dannis97500/CP_Prompt.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive language models are the currently dominant paradigm for text generation, but they have some fundamental limitations that cannot be remedied by scale-for example inherently sequential and unidirectional generation. While alternate classes of models have been explored, we have limited mathematical understanding of their fundamental power and limitations. In this paper we focus on Generative Masked Language Models (GMLMs), a non-autoregressive paradigm in which we train a model to fit conditional probabilities of the data distribution via masking, which are subsequently used as inputs to a Markov Chain to draw samples from the model, These models empirically strike a promising speed-quality trade-off as each step can be typically parallelized by decoding the entire sequence in parallel. We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing and improving such models which sheds light on questions of sample complexity and inference speed and quality. Empirically, we adapt the T5 model for iteratively-refined parallel decoding, achieving 2-3x speedup in machine translation with minimal sacrifice in quality compared with autoregressive models. We run careful ablation experiments to give recommendations on key design choices, and make fine-grained observations on the common error modes in connection with our theory. Our mathematical analyses and empirical observations characterize both potentials and limitations of this approach, and can be applied to future works on improving understanding and performance of GMLMs. Our codes are released at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/padir</p>

<p>Abstract: As language models support larger and larger context sizes, evaluating their ability to make effective use of that context becomes increasingly important. We analyze the ability of several code generation models to handle long range dependencies using a suite of multi-step key retrieval tasks in context windows up to 8k tokens in length. The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x. Our analysis highlights different facets of long-context performance and is suggestive of prompt construction strategies for code completion tools</p>

<p>Abstract: Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial in healthcare due to the severe consequences of errors, and this is important for building trust among AI and users in sentiment analysis task. Incorporating reasoning capabilities helps Large Language Models (LLMs) understand human emotions within broader contexts, handle nuanced and ambiguous language, and infer underlying sentiments that may not be explicitly stated. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Our study showed that rationale-augmented training enhances model performance in sentiment classification across both human transcript and ASR settings. Also, we found that the generated rationales typically exhibit different vocabularies compared to human-generated rationales, but maintain similar semantics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Terrance Liu, Zhiwei Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models are rapidly moving towards consumer-facing applications, they are often still prone to factual errors and hallucinations. In order to reduce the potential harms that may come from these errors, it is important for users to know to what extent they can trust an LLM when it makes a factual claim. To this end, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification of factual correctness in long-form natural language generation. Given some output from a large language model, we study both uncertainty at the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and uncertainty across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Moreover, we invoke multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction to ensure that such uncertainty guarantees are valid both marginally and across distinct groups of prompts. Using the task of biography generation, we demonstrate empirically that having access to and making use of additional group attributes for each prompt improves both overall and group-wise performance. As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored previously in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these empirical results to form a benchmark for this setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent developments of adiabatic quantum machine learning (AQML) methods and applications based on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model have received attention from academics and practitioners. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines, balanced k-means clustering, linear regression, Decision Tree Splitting, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and Deep Belief Networks can be transformed into a QUBO model. The training of adiabatic quantum machine learning models is the bottleneck for computation. Heuristics-based quantum annealing solvers such as Simulated Annealing and Multiple Start Tabu Search (MSTS) are implemented to speed up the training of AQML based on the QUBO model. The main purpose of this paper is to present a hybrid heuristic embedding an r-flip strategy to solve large-scale QUBO with an improved solution and shorter computing time compared to the state-of-the-art MSTS method. The results of the substantial computational experiments are reported to compare an r-flip strategy embedded hybrid heuristic and a multiple start tabu search algorithm on a set of benchmark instances and three large-scale QUBO instances. The r-flip strategy embedded algorithm provides very high-quality solutions within the CPU time limits of 60 and 600 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Shu, Haoran Zhao, Xukun Liu, David Demeter, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of legal analytics, finding relevant cases and accurately predicting judicial outcomes are challenging because of the complexity of legal language, which often includes specialized terminology, complex syntax, and historical context. Moreover, the subtle distinctions between similar and precedent cases require a deep understanding of legal knowledge. Researchers often conflate these concepts, making it difficult to develop specialized techniques to effectively address these nuanced tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Law Large Language Model (LawLLM), a multi-task model specifically designed for the US legal domain to address these challenges. LawLLM excels at Similar Case Retrieval (SCR), Precedent Case Recommendation (PCR), and Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). By clearly distinguishing between precedent and similar cases, we provide essential clarity, guiding future research in developing specialized strategies for these tasks. We propose customized data preprocessing techniques for each task that transform raw legal data into a trainable format. Furthermore, we also use techniques such as in-context learning (ICL) and advanced information retrieval methods in LawLLM. The evaluation results demonstrate that LawLLM consistently outperforms existing baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, offering unparalleled multi-task capabilities and filling critical gaps in the legal domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nakamasa Inoue, Shinta Otake, Takumi Hirose, Masanari Ohi, Rei Kawakami</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a key approach for learning generic representations from speech data. Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the WavLM backbone, its performance was comparable to or better than that of full fine-tuning on all tasks while requiring 90% fewer learnable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuewen Mei, Tong Nie, Jian Sun, Ye Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring fault tolerance of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs) is crucial for their safety due to the presence of potentially severe faults. Hence, Fault Injection (FI) testing is conducted by practitioners to evaluate the safety level of HAVs. To fully cover test cases, various driving scenarios and fault settings should be considered. However, due to numerous combinations of test scenarios and fault settings, the testing space can be complex and high-dimensional. In addition, evaluating performance in all newly added scenarios is resource-consuming. The rarity of critical faults that can cause security problems further strengthens the challenge. To address these challenges, we propose to accelerate FI testing under the low-rank Smoothness Regularized Matrix Factorization (SRMF) framework. We first organize the sparse evaluated data into a structured matrix based on its safety values. Then the untested values are estimated by the correlation captured by the matrix structure. To address high dimensionality, a low-rank constraint is imposed on the testing space. To exploit the relationships between existing scenarios and new scenarios and capture the local regularity of critical faults, three types of smoothness regularization are further designed as a complement. We conduct experiments on car following and cut in scenarios. The results indicate that SRMF has the lowest prediction error in various scenarios and is capable of predicting rare critical faults compared to other machine learning models. In addition, SRMF can achieve 1171 acceleration rate, 99.3% precision and 91.1% F1 score in identifying critical faults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce low-rank models to FI testing of HAVs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somshubra Majumdar, Vahid Noroozi, Sean Narenthiran, Aleksander Ficek, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on instruction samples for alignment, but creating these datasets poses challenges, particularly in expert-dependent tasks like coding, which can be cost-prohibitive. One approach to mitigate these challenges is synthesizing data using another LLM. In this paper, we introduce a scalable method for generating synthetic instructions to enhance the code generation capability of LLMs. The proposed algorithm, Genetic-Instruct, mimics evolutionary processes, utilizing self-instruction to create numerous synthetic samples from a limited number of seeds. Genetic-Instruct is designed for efficient scaling of the generation process. Fine-tuning multiple coding LLMs with the synthetic samples demonstrates a significant improvement in their code generation accuracy compared to the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen Dereich, Arnulf Jentzen</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods are nowadays the method of choice for the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) in artificial intelligence systems. In practically relevant training problems, usually not the plain vanilla standard SGD method is the employed optimization scheme but instead suitably accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods are applied. As of today, maybe the most popular variant of such accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods is the famous Adam optimizer proposed by Kingma & Ba in 2014. Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in implementations, it remained an open problem of research to provide a convergence analysis for the Adam optimizer even in the situation of simple quadratic stochastic optimization problems where the objective function (the function one intends to minimize) is strongly convex. In this work we solve this problem by establishing optimal convergence rates for the Adam optimizer for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, in particular, covering simple quadratic stochastic optimization problems. The key ingredient of our convergence analysis is a new vector field function which we propose to refer to as the Adam vector field. This Adam vector field accurately describes the macroscopic behaviour of the Adam optimization process but differs from the negative gradient of the objective function (the function we intend to minimize) of the considered stochastic optimization problem. In particular, our convergence analysis reveals that the Adam optimizer does typically not converge to critical points of the objective function (zeros of the gradient of the objective function) of the considered optimization problem but converges with rates to zeros of this Adam vector field.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21082">Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Self-Supervised Early Exits</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Valade</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for accelerating inference in large, pre-trained language models (LLMs) by introducing early exits during inference. The computational demands of these models, used across a wide range of applications, can be substantial. By capitalizing on the inherent variability in token complexity, our approach enables selective acceleration of the inference process. Specifically, we propose the integration of early exit ''heads'' atop existing transformer layers, which facilitate conditional terminations based on a confidence metric. These heads are trained in a self-supervised manner using the model's own predictions as training data, thereby eliminating the need for additional annotated data. The confidence metric, established using a calibration set, ensures a desired level of accuracy while enabling early termination when confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold. Notably, our method preserves the original accuracy and reduces computational time on certain tasks, leveraging the existing knowledge of pre-trained LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. This lightweight, modular modification has the potential to greatly enhance the practical usability of LLMs, particularly in applications like real-time language processing in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Chih Chang, Wei-Cheng Lin, Chien-Yu Lin, Chong-Yan Chen, Yu-Fang Hu, Pei-Shuo Wang, Ning-Chi Huang, Luis Ceze, Kai-Chiang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: KV-Cache compression methods generally sample a KV-Cache of effectual tokens or quantize it into lower bits. However, these methods cannot exploit the redundancy of the hidden dimension of KV tensors. This paper investigates a unique hidden dimension approach called Palu, a novel KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a low-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU kernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can compress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache quantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing KV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the attention module. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging artificial intelligence applications across the domains of computer vision, natural language processing, graph processing, and sequence prediction increasingly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs). These DNNs require significant compute and memory resources for training and inference. Traditional computing platforms such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs are struggling to keep up with the demands of the increasingly complex and diverse DNNs. Optical computing represents an exciting new paradigm for light-speed acceleration of DNN workloads. In this article, we discuss the fundamentals and state-of-the-art developments in optical computing, with an emphasis on DNN acceleration. Various promising approaches are described for engineering optical devices, enhancing optical circuits, and designing architectures that can adapt optical computing to a variety of DNN workloads. Novel techniques for hardware/software co-design that can intelligently tune and map DNN models to improve performance and energy-efficiency on optical computing platforms across high performance and resource constrained embedded, edge, and IoT platforms are also discussed. Lastly, several open problems and future directions for research in this domain are highlighted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernard J. Giron Castro, Christophe Peucheret, Darko Zibar, Francesco Da Ros</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panfeng Cao, Pietro Lio</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: eBay partners with external vendors, which allows customers to freely select a vendor to complete their eBay experiences. However, vendor outages can hinder customer experiences. Consequently, eBay can disable a problematic vendor to prevent customer loss. Disabling the vendor too late risks losing customers willing to switch to other vendors, while disabling it too early risks losing those unwilling to switch. In this paper, we propose a data-driven solution to answer whether eBay should disable a problematic vendor and when to disable it. Our solution involves forecasting customer behavior. First, we use a multiplicative seasonality model to represent behavior if all vendors are fully functioning. Next, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to represent behavior if the problematic vendor remains enabled. Finally, we use a linear model to represent behavior if the vendor is disabled. By comparing these forecasts, we determine the optimal time for eBay to disable the problematic vendor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Zhang, Chaofeng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table. Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization. However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification. Our method adaptively locates \textit{surprising tokens} of the input. A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is "certain but wrong", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time. By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data. The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models. Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\%. We also introduce a new benchmark Dolma-Book developed upon a novel framework, which employs book data collected both before and after model training to provide further evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corn\'e Verburg, Alexander Heinlein, Eric C. Cyr</p>
<p>Abstract: The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\,\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.

Understanding the uncertainty of predictive models in ultrasound imaging is crucial for assessing their reliability. We introduce MSU-Net, a novel multistage approach for training an ensemble of U-Nets to yield accurate ultrasound image segmentation maps. We demonstrate substantial improvements, 18.1% over a single Monte Carlo U-Net, enhancing uncertainty evaluations, model transparency, and trustworthiness. By highlighting areas of model certainty, MSU-Net can guide safe needle insertions, empowering non-experts to accomplish such tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) can achieve satisfactory segmentation performance under high-quality box prompts. However, SAM's robustness is compromised by the decline in box quality, limiting its practicality in clinical reality. In this study, we propose a novel Robust Box prompt based SAM (\textbf{RoBox-SAM}) to ensure SAM's segmentation performance under prompts with different qualities. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a prompt refinement module to implicitly perceive the potential targets, and output the offsets to directly transform the low-quality box prompt into a high-quality one. We then provide an online iterative strategy for further prompt refinement. Second, we introduce a prompt enhancement module to automatically generate point prompts to assist the box-promptable segmentation effectively. Last, we build a self-information extractor to encode the prior information from the input image. These features can optimize the image embeddings and attention calculation, thus, the robustness of SAM can be further enhanced. Extensive experiments on the large medical segmentation dataset including 99,299 images, 5 modalities, and 25 organs/targets validated the efficacy of our proposed RoBox-SAM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Rasoul Etesami, R. Srikant</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stable matchings in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated manner. In this problem, there are $n$ men and $n$ women, each having preference over the other side. It is assumed that women know their preferences over men, but men are not aware of their preferences over women, and they only learn them if they propose and successfully get matched to women. A matching is called stable if no man and woman prefer each other over their current matches. When all the preferences are known a priori, the celebrated Deferred-Acceptance algorithm proposed by Gale and Shapley provides a decentralized and uncoordinated algorithm to obtain a stable matching. However, when the preferences are unknown, developing such an algorithm faces major challenges due to a lack of coordination. We achieve this goal by making a connection between stable matchings and learning Nash equilibria (NE) in noncooperative games. First, we provide a complete information game formulation for the stable matching problem with known preferences such that its set of pure NE coincides with the set of stable matchings, while its mixed NE can be rounded in a decentralized manner to a stable matching. Relying on such a game-theoretic formulation, we show that for hierarchical markets, adopting the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm for the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret with polynomial dependence on the number of players, thus answering a question posed in previous literature. Moreover, we show that the same EXP learning algorithm converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general matching markets. We complement this result by introducing another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability, leveraging the weak acyclicity property of the stable matching game.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustav Bhattacharjee, Soumya Kundu, Indrasis Chakraborty, Aritra Dasgupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Net load forecasting is crucial for energy planning and facilitating informed decision-making regarding trade and load distributions. However, evaluating forecasting models' performance against benchmark models remains challenging, thereby impeding experts' trust in the model's performance. In this context, there is a demand for technological interventions that allow scientists to compare models across various timeframes and solar penetration levels. This paper introduces a visual analytics-based application designed to compare the performance of deep-learning-based net load forecasting models with other models for probabilistic net load forecasting. This application employs carefully selected visual analytic interventions, enabling users to discern differences in model performance across different solar penetration levels, dataset resolutions, and hours of the day over multiple months. We also present observations made using our application through a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of visualizations in aiding scientists in making informed decisions and enhancing trust in net load forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Rahul Bhadani, Zhanbo Sun, Larry Head</p>
<p>Abstract: The prediction of surrounding vehicle trajectories is crucial for collision-free path planning. In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Abedi, Q. M. Jonathan Wu, Ning Zhang, Farhad Pourpanah</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to mitigate the domain shift issue, where the distribution of training (source) data differs from that of testing (target) data. Many models have been developed to tackle this problem, and recently vision transformers (ViTs) have shown promising results. However, the complexity and large number of trainable parameters of ViTs restrict their deployment in practical applications. This underscores the need for an efficient model that not only reduces trainable parameters but also allows for adjustable complexity based on specific needs while delivering comparable performance. To achieve this, in this paper we introduce an Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (EUDA) framework. EUDA employs the DINOv2, which is a self-supervised ViT, as a feature extractor followed by a simplified bottleneck of fully connected layers to refine features for enhanced domain adaptation. Additionally, EUDA employs the synergistic domain alignment loss (SDAL), which integrates cross-entropy (CE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) losses, to balance adaptation by minimizing classification errors in the source domain while aligning the source and target domain distributions. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of EUDA in producing comparable results as compared with other state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation with significantly fewer trainable parameters, between 42% to 99.7% fewer. This showcases the ability to train the model in a resource-limited environment. The code of the model is available at: https://github.com/A-Abedi/EUDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiang Hao, Xiao Jin, Hu Xiaoguang, Chen Tianyou</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DM) represent one of the most advanced generative models today, yet recent studies suggest that DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks establish hidden associations between particular input patterns and model behaviors, compromising model integrity by triggering undesirable actions with manipulated input data. This vulnerability poses substantial risks, including reputational damage to model owners and the dissemination of harmful content. To mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks, there have been some investigations on backdoor detection and model repair. However, previous work fails to purify the backdoored DMs created by state-of-the-art attacks, rendering the field much underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Diff-Cleanse}, a novel two-stage backdoor defense framework specifically designed for DMs. The first stage employs a innovative trigger inversion technique to detect the backdoor and reconstruct the trigger, and the second stage utilizes a structural pruning method to eliminate the backdoor. We evaluate our framework on hundreds of DMs attacked by 3 existing backdoor attack methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-Cleanse achieves nearly 100\% detection accuracy and effectively mitigates backdoor impacts, preserving the model's benign performance with minimal compromise. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/shymuel/diff-cleanse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Valencia, Henry Williams, Yuning Xing, Trevor Gee, Minas Liarokapis, Bruce A. MacDonald</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used to solve tasks where the environment consistently provides a dense reward value. However, in real-world scenarios, rewards can often be poorly defined or sparse. Auxiliary signals are indispensable for discovering efficient exploration strategies and aiding the learning process. In this work, inspired by intrinsic motivation theory, we postulate that the intrinsic stimuli of novelty and surprise can assist in improving exploration in complex, sparsely rewarded environments. We introduce a novel sample-efficient method able to learn directly from pixels, an image-based extension of TD3 with an autoencoder called \textit{NaSA-TD3}. The experiments demonstrate that NaSA-TD3 is easy to train and an efficient method for tackling complex continuous-control robotic tasks, both in simulated environments and real-world settings. NaSA-TD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL image-based methods in terms of final performance without requiring pre-trained models or human demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is a highly active area of research, with deep learning-based methods achieving state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks. However, the lack of standardized tools for training, testing, and evaluating new methods makes the comparison of methods difficult. To address this, we introduce the Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), a simple, modular, and end-to-end medical imaging segmentation framework designed to facilitate consistent training, testing, and evaluation of deep learning-based medical imaging segmentation methods. MIST standardizes data analysis, preprocessing, and evaluation pipelines, accommodating multiple architectures and loss functions. This standardization ensures reproducible and fair comparisons across different methods. We detail MIST's data format requirements, pipelines, and auxiliary features and demonstrate its efficacy using the BraTS Adult Glioma Post-Treatment Challenge dataset. Our results highlight MIST's ability to produce accurate segmentation masks and its scalability across multiple GPUs, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for future medical imaging research and development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danfeng Guo, Demetri Terzopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junnan Yang, Huiling Zhang, Zi Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their importance in various emerging applications, efficient algorithms for solving minimax problems have recently received increasing attention. However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of the problem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In this paper, we propose a completely parameter-free alternating gradient projection (PF-AGP) algorithm to solve the smooth nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems using a backtracking strategy, which does not require prior knowledge of parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or the strongly concave constant $\mu$. The PF-AGP algorithm utilizes a parameter-free gradient projection step to alternately update the outer and inner variables in each iteration. We show that the total number of gradient calls of the PF-AGP algorithm to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point for nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number, while the total number of gradient calls to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point for nonconvex-concave minimax problems is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L^4\varepsilon^{-4} \right)$. As far as we know, this is the first completely parameter-free algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, and it is also the completely parameter-free algorithm which achieves the best iteration complexity in single loop method for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed PF-AGP algorithm.</p>

It is inspired by the fact that a positive mood can lead to improved cognitive capabilities including classification tasks. The network is hence presented in a first phase with smileys and an encouraging loss function is defined to bias it into a good mood. SmileyNet is then used to forecast the flipping of a coin based on an established method of Tasseology, namely by reading tea leaves. Training and testing in this second phase are done with a high-fidelity simulation based on real-world pixels sampled from a professional tea-reading cup. SmileyNet has an amazing accuracy of 72% to correctly predict the flip of a coin. Resnet-34, respectively YOLOv5 achieve only 49%, respectively 53%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su I Iao, Yidong Zhou, Hans-Georg M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in modern science have led to the increasing availability of non-Euclidean data in metric spaces. This paper addresses the challenge of modeling relationships between non-Euclidean responses and multivariate Euclidean predictors. We propose a flexible regression model capable of handling high-dimensional predictors without imposing parametric assumptions. Two primary challenges are addressed: the curse of dimensionality in nonparametric regression and the absence of linear structure in general metric spaces. The former is tackled using deep neural networks, while for the latter we demonstrate the feasibility of mapping the metric space where responses reside to a low-dimensional Euclidean space using manifold learning. We introduce a reverse mapping approach, employing local Fr\'echet regression, to map the low-dimensional manifold representations back to objects in the original metric space. We develop a theoretical framework, investigating the convergence rate of deep neural networks under dependent sub-Gaussian noise with bias. The convergence rate of the proposed regression model is then obtained by expanding the scope of local Fr\'echet regression to accommodate multivariate predictors in the presence of errors in predictors. Simulations and case studies show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods for non-Euclidean responses, focusing on the special cases of probability measures and networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Valentin, Jinmiao Fu, Gianluca Detommaso, Shaoyuan Xu, Giovanni Zappella, Bryan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Soize, Roger Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: PLoM (Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds) is a method introduced in 2016 for handling small training datasets by projecting an It\^o equation from a stochastic dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical system, acting as the MCMC generator, for which the KDE-estimated probability measure with the training dataset is the invariant measure. PLoM performs a projection on a reduced-order vector basis related to the training dataset, using the diffusion maps (DMAPS) basis constructed with a time-independent isotropic kernel. In this paper, we propose a new ISDE projection vector basis built from a transient anisotropic kernel, providing an alternative to the DMAPS basis to improve statistical surrogates for stochastic manifolds with heterogeneous data. The construction ensures that for times near the initial time, the DMAPS basis coincides with the transient basis. For larger times, the differences between the two bases are characterized by the angle of their spanned vector subspaces. The optimal instant yielding the optimal transient basis is determined using an estimation of mutual information from Information Theory, which is normalized by the entropy estimation to account for the effects of the number of realizations used in the estimations. Consequently, this new vector basis better represents statistical dependencies in the learned probability measure for any dimension. Three applications with varying levels of statistical complexity and data heterogeneity validate the proposed theory, showing that the transient anisotropic kernel improves the learned probability measure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanpeng Chen, Chengjin Xu, Yiyan Qi, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating content across multiple data modalities, including text, images, audio, and video. However, a significant drawback of MLLMs is their reliance on static training data, leading to outdated information and limited contextual awareness. This static nature hampers their ability to provide accurate, up-to-date responses, particularly in dynamic or rapidly evolving contexts. Integrating Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation (Multimodal RAG) offers a promising solution, but the system would inevitably encounter the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem, which involves two types of noise: coarse-grained (query-caption) and fine-grained (query-image). This noise hinders accurate retrieval and generation. In this work, we propose \textbf{RagLLaVA}, a novel framework with knowledge-enhanced reranking and noise-injected training, to address these limitations. We instruction-tune the MLLM with a simple yet effective instruction template to induce its ranking ability and serve it as a reranker to precisely filter the top-k retrieved images. For generation, we inject visual noise during training at the data and token levels to enhance the generator's robustness. Extensive experiments are conducted on the subsets of two datasets that require retrieving and reasoning over images to answer a given query. Our results demonstrate the superiority of RagLLaVA in retrieving accurately and generating robustly. Code and models are available at https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/RagLLaVA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have been used to address the challenging problems in the offloading process of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). More recently, they have been utilized to improve the dissemination of high-definition (HD) Maps. Nevertheless, implementing solutions such as deep Q-learning (DQN) and Actor-critic at the autonomous vehicle (AV) may lead to an increase in the computational load, causing a heavy burden on the computational devices and higher costs. Moreover, their implementation might raise compatibility issues between technologies due to the required modifications to the standards. Therefore, in this paper, we assess the scalability of an application utilizing a Q-learning single-agent solution in a distributed multi-agent environment. This application improves the network performance by taking advantage of a smaller state, and action space whilst using a multi-agent approach. The proposed solution is extensively evaluated with different test cases involving reward function considering individual or overall network performance, number of agents, and centralized and distributed learning comparison. The experimental results demonstrate that the time latencies of our proposed solution conducted in voice, video, HD Map, and best-effort cases have significant improvements, with 40.4%, 36%, 43%, and 12% respectively, compared to the performances with the single-agent approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Echocardiography video is a primary modality for diagnosing heart diseases, but the limited data poses challenges for both clinical teaching and machine learning training. Recently, video generative models have emerged as a promising strategy to alleviate this issue. However, previous methods often relied on holistic conditions during generation, hindering the flexible movement control over specific cardiac structures. In this context, we propose an explainable and controllable method for echocardiography video generation, taking an initial frame and a motion curve as guidance. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we extract motion information from each heart substructure to construct motion curves, enabling the diffusion model to synthesize customized echocardiography videos by modifying these curves. Second, we propose the structure-to-motion alignment module, which can map semantic features onto motion curves across cardiac structures. Third, The position-aware attention mechanism is designed to enhance video consistency utilizing Gaussian masks with structural position information. Extensive experiments on three echocardiography datasets show that our method outperforms others regarding fidelity and consistency.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of image semantic communication in a multi-user deployment scenario and propose a federated learning (FL) strategy for a Swin Transformer-based semantic communication system (FSSC). Firstly, we demonstrate that the adoption of a Swin Transformer for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) effectively extracts semantic information in the communication system. Next, the FL framework is introduced to collaboratively learn a global model by aggregating local model parameters, rather than directly sharing clients' data. This approach enhances user privacy protection and reduces the workload on the server or mobile edge. Simulation evaluations indicate that our method outperforms the typical JSCC algorithm and traditional separate-based communication algorithms. Particularly after integrating local semantics, the global aggregation model has further increased the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by more than 2dB, thoroughly proving the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p>

The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests. This first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91 contaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the individual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform continues to be online, open to contributions from the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joel Vasanth, Jean Rabault, Francisco Alc\'antara-\'Avila, Mikael Mortensen, Ricardo Vinuesa</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has found application in numerous use-cases pertaining to flow control. Multi-agent RL (MARL), a variant of DRL, has shown to be more effective than single-agent RL in controlling flows exhibiting locality and translational invariance. We present, for the first time, an implementation of MARL-based control of three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Control is executed by modifying the temperature distribution along the bottom wall divided into multiple control segments, each of which acts as an independent agent. Two regimes of RBC are considered at Rayleigh numbers $\mathrm{Ra}=500$ and $750$. Evaluation of the learned control policy reveals a reduction in convection intensity by $23.5\%$ and $8.7\%$ at $\mathrm{Ra}=500$ and $750$, respectively. The MARL controller converts irregularly shaped convective patterns to regular straight rolls with lower convection that resemble flow in a relatively more stable regime. We draw comparisons with proportional control at both $\mathrm{Ra}$ and show that MARL is able to outperform the proportional controller. The learned control strategy is complex, featuring different non-linear segment-wise actuator delays and actuation magnitudes. We also perform successful evaluations on a larger domain than used for training, demonstrating that the invariant property of MARL allows direct transfer of the learnt policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saloua Naama, Kav\'e Salamatian, Francesco Bronzino</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph embedding approaches attempt to project graphs into geometric entities, i.e, manifolds. The idea is that the geometric properties of the projected manifolds are helpful in the inference of graph properties. However, if the choice of the embedding manifold is incorrectly performed, it can lead to incorrect geometric inference. In this paper, we argue that the classical embedding techniques cannot lead to correct geometric interpretation as they miss the curvature at each point, of manifold. We advocate that for doing correct geometric interpretation the embedding of graph should be done over regular constant curvature manifolds. To this end, we present an embedding approach, the discrete Ricci flow graph embedding (dRfge) based on the discrete Ricci flow that adapts the distance between nodes in a graph so that the graph can be embedded onto a constant curvature manifold that is homogeneous and isotropic, i.e., all directions are equivalent and distances comparable, resulting in correct geometric interpretations. A major contribution of this paper is that for the first time, we prove the convergence of discrete Ricci flow to a constant curvature and stable distance metrics over the edges. A drawback of using the discrete Ricci flow is the high computational complexity that prevented its usage in large-scale graph analysis. Another contribution of this paper is a new algorithmic solution that makes it feasible to calculate the Ricci flow for graphs of up to 50k nodes, and beyond. The intuitions behind the discrete Ricci flow make it possible to obtain new insights into the structure of large-scale graphs. We demonstrate this through a case study on analyzing the internet connectivity structure between countries at the BGP level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faming Liang, Sehwan Kim, Yan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: While fiducial inference was widely considered a big blunder by R.A. Fisher, the goal he initially set --`inferring the uncertainty of model parameters on the basis of observations' -- has been continually pursued by many statisticians. To this end, we develop a new statistical inference method called extended Fiducial inference (EFI). The new method achieves the goal of fiducial inference by leveraging advanced statistical computing techniques while remaining scalable for big data. EFI involves jointly imputing random errors realized in observations using stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo and estimating the inverse function using a sparse deep neural network (DNN). The consistency of the sparse DNN estimator ensures that the uncertainty embedded in observations is properly propagated to model parameters through the estimated inverse function, thereby validating downstream statistical inference. Compared to frequentist and Bayesian methods, EFI offers significant advantages in parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Specifically, EFI provides higher fidelity in parameter estimation, especially when outliers are present in the observations; and eliminates the need for theoretical reference distributions in hypothesis testing, thereby automating the statistical inference process. EFI also provides an innovative framework for semi-supervised learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Zambre, Ekdev Rajkitkul, Akshatha Mohan, Joshua Peeples</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision by autonomously identifying and locating objects of interest. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is an effective single-shot detector. However, YOLO faces challenges in cluttered or partially occluded scenes and can struggle with small, low-contrast objects. We propose a new method that integrates spatial transformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed STN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important areas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the detection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different localization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the model across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on benchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset from a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Foscarin, Jan Schl\"uter, Gerhard Widmer</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a system for tracking beats and downbeats with two objectives: generality across a diverse music range, and high accuracy. We achieve generality by training on multiple datasets -- including solo instrument recordings, pieces with time signature changes, and classical music with high tempo variations -- and by removing the commonly used Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) postprocessing, which introduces constraints on the meter and tempo. For high accuracy, among other improvements, we develop a loss function tolerant to small time shifts of annotations, and an architecture alternating convolutions with transformers either over frequency or time. Our system surpasses the current state of the art in F1 score despite using no DBN. However, it can still fail, especially for difficult and underrepresented genres, and performs worse on continuity metrics, so we publish our model, code, and preprocessed datasets, and invite others to beat this.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paula Lago</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable devices are increasingly used as tools for biomedical research, as the continuous stream of behavioral and physiological data they collect can provide insights about our health in everyday contexts. Long-term tracking, defined in the timescale of months of year, can provide insights of patterns and changes as indicators of health changes. These insights can make medicine and healthcare more predictive, preventive, personalized, and participative (The 4P's). However, the challenges in modeling, understanding and processing longitudinal data are a significant barrier to their adoption in research studies and clinical settings. In this paper, we review and discuss three models used to make sense of longitudinal data: routines, rhythms and stability metrics. We present the challenges associated with the processing and analysis of longitudinal wearable sensor data, with a special focus on how to handle the different temporal dynamics at various granularities. We then discuss current limitations and identify directions for future work. This review is essential to the advancement of computational modeling and analysis of longitudinal sensor data for pervasive healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aswini Kumar Patra, Ankit Varshney, Lingaraj Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), achieving excellent empathetic response capabilities has become a crucial prerequisite. Consequently, managing and understanding empathetic datasets have gained increasing significance. However, empathetic data are typically human-labeled, leading to insufficient datasets and wasted human labor. In this work, we present Synth-Empathy, an LLM-based data generation and quality and diversity selection pipeline that automatically generates high-quality empathetic data while discarding low-quality data. With the data generated from a low empathetic model, we are able to further improve empathetic response performance and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, our model achieves SoTA performance on various human evaluation benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications. Furthermore, we show the trade-off between data quantity and quality, providing insights into empathetic data generation and selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Geo Benjamin, Mothilal Asokan, Amna Alhosani, Hussain Alasmawi, Werner Gerhard Diehl, Leanne Bricker, Karthik Nandakumar, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are popular since they can address situations with limited annotated data by directly utilising the underlying data distribution. However, the adoption of such methods is not explored enough in ultrasound (US) imaging, especially for fetal assessment. We investigate the potential of dual-encoder SSL in utilizing unlabelled US video data to improve the performance of challenging downstream Standard Fetal Cardiac Planes (SFCP) classification using limited labelled 2D US images. We study 7 SSL approaches based on reconstruction, contrastive loss, distillation, and information theory and evaluate them extensively on a large private US dataset. Our observations and findings are consolidated from more than 500 downstream training experiments under different settings. Our primary observation shows that for SSL training, the variance of the dataset is more crucial than its size because it allows the model to learn generalisable representations, which improve the performance of downstream tasks. Overall, the BarlowTwins method shows robust performance, irrespective of the training settings and data variations, when used as an initialisation for downstream tasks. Notably, full fine-tuning with 1% of labelled data outperforms ImageNet initialisation by 12% in F1-score and outperforms other SSL initialisations by at least 4% in F1-score, thus making it a promising candidate for transfer learning from US video to image data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mothilal Asokan, Joseph Geo Benjamin, Mohammad Yaqub, Karthik Nandakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting foundation models for medical image analysis requires finetuning them on a considerable amount of data because of extreme distribution shifts between natural (source) data used for pretraining and medical (target) data. However, collecting task-specific medical data for such finetuning at a central location raises many privacy concerns. Although Federated learning (FL) provides an effective means for training on private decentralized data, communication costs in federating large foundation models can quickly become a significant bottleneck, impacting the solution's scalability. In this work, we address this problem of efficient communication while ensuring effective learning in FL by combining the strengths of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) with FL. Specifically, we study plug-and-play Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) in a federated manner to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for 3D medical image segmentation. Unlike prior works that utilize LoRA and finetune the entire decoder, we critically analyze the contribution of each granular component of SAM on finetuning performance. Thus, we identify specific layers to be federated that are very efficient in terms of communication cost while producing on-par accuracy. Our experiments show that retaining the parameters of the SAM model (including most of the decoder) in their original state during adaptation is beneficial because fine-tuning on small datasets tends to distort the inherent capabilities of the underlying foundation model. On Fed-KiTS, our approach decreases communication cost (~48x) compared to full fine-tuning while increasing performance (~6% Dice score) in 3D segmentation tasks. Our approach performs similar to SAMed while achieving ~2.8x reduction in communication and parameters to be finetuned. We further validate our approach with experiments on Fed-IXI and Prostate MRI datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in safety-critical robotics settings must be robust to distribution shifts. However, system designers must understand the cause of a distribution shift in order to implement the appropriate intervention or mitigation strategy and prevent system failure. In this paper, we present a novel framework for diagnosing distribution shifts in a streaming fashion by deploying multiple stochastic martingales simultaneously. We show that knowledge of the underlying cause of a distribution shift can lead to proper interventions over the lifecycle of a deployed system. Our experimental framework can easily be adapted to different types of distribution shifts, models, and datasets. We find that our method outperforms existing work on diagnosing distribution shifts in terms of speed, accuracy, and flexibility, and validate the efficiency of our model in both simulated and live hardware settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Victoria Lin, Akshat Shrivastava, Liang Luo, Srinivasan Iyer, Mike Lewis, Gargi Gosh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Armen Aghajanyan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MoMa, a novel modality-aware mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for pre-training mixed-modal, early-fusion language models. MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa's potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Handwriting Verification is a critical in document forensics. Deep learning based approaches often face skepticism from forensic document examiners due to their lack of explainability and reliance on extensive training data and handcrafted features. This paper explores using Vision Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's PaliGemma, to address these challenges. By leveraging their Visual Question Answering capabilities and 0-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our goal is to provide clear, human-understandable explanations for model decisions. Our experiments on the CEDAR handwriting dataset demonstrate that VLMs offer enhanced interpretability, reduce the need for large training datasets, and adapt better to diverse handwriting styles. However, results show that the CNN-based ResNet-18 architecture outperforms the 0-shot CoT prompt engineering approach with GPT-4o (Accuracy: 70%) and supervised fine-tuned PaliGemma (Accuracy: 71%), achieving an accuracy of 84% on the CEDAR AND dataset. These findings highlight the potential of VLMs in generating human-interpretable decisions while underscoring the need for further advancements to match the performance of specialized deep learning models.</p>

Backtesting on more than a decade of option contracts for equities listed on the S&P 100, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit significant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based trading strategies.

<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for ensuring the safety of machine learning systems and has shaped the field of OOD detection. Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection, and OD in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. In addition, we also highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection, including the discussion over other related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection. Finally, we explore the advancements in the emerging Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) era, such as GPT-4V. We conclude this survey with open challenges and future directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose K-Deep Simplex(KDS) which, given a set of data points, learns a dictionary comprising synthetic landmarks, along with representation coefficients supported on a simplex. KDS employs a local weighted $\ell_1$ penalty that encourages each data point to represent itself as a convex combination of nearby landmarks. We solve the proposed optimization program using alternating minimization and design an efficient, interpretable autoencoder using algorithm unrolling. We theoretically analyze the proposed program by relating the weighted $\ell_1$ penalty in KDS to a weighted $\ell_0$ program. Assuming that the data are generated from a Delaunay triangulation, we prove the equivalence of the weighted $\ell_1$ and weighted $\ell_0$ programs. We further show the stability of the representation coefficients under mild geometrical assumptions. If the representation coefficients are fixed, we prove that the sub-problem of minimizing over the dictionary yields a unique solution. Further, we show that low-dimensional representations can be efficiently obtained from the covariance of the coefficient matrix. Experiments show that the algorithm is highly efficient and performs competitively on synthetic and real data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Renard, Thibault Laugel, Marcin Detyniecki</p>
<p>Abstract: A multitude of classifiers can be trained on the same data to achieve similar performances during test time, while having learned significantly different classification patterns. This phenomenon, which we call prediction discrepancies, is often associated with the blind selection of one model instead of another with similar performances. When making a choice, the machine learning practitioner has no understanding on the differences between models, their limits, where they agree and where they don't. But his/her choice will result in concrete consequences for instances to be classified in the discrepancy zone, since the final decision will be based on the selected classification pattern. Besides the arbitrary nature of the result, a bad choice could have further negative consequences such as loss of opportunity or lack of fairness. This paper proposes to address this question by analyzing the prediction discrepancies in a pool of best-performing models trained on the same data. A model-agnostic algorithm, DIG, is proposed to capture and explain discrepancies locally, to enable the practitioner to make the best educated decision when selecting a model by anticipating its potential undesired consequences. All the code to reproduce the experiments is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamidreza Behjoo, Michael Chertkov</p>
<p>Abstract: The computational complexity of inference -- required to compute the partition function, $Z$, of an Ising model over a graph of $N$''spins" -- is most likely exponential in $N$. Efficient variational methods, such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Tree Re-Weighted (TRW) algorithms, compute $Z$ approximately by minimizing the respective (BP- or TRW-) free energy. We generalize the variational scheme by building a $\lambda$-fractional interpolation, $Z^{(\lambda)}$, where $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$ correspond to TRW- and BP-approximations, respectively. This fractional scheme -- coined Fractional Belief Propagation (FBP) -- guarantees that in the attractive (ferromagnetic) case $Z^{(TRW)} \geq Z^{(\lambda)} \geq Z^{(BP)}$, and there exists a unique (``exact") $\lambda_*$ such that $Z=Z^{(\lambda_*)}$. Generalizing the re-parametrization approach of \citep{wainwright_tree-based_2002} and the loop series approach of \citep{chertkov_loop_2006}, we show how to express $Z$ as a product, $\forall \lambda:\ Z=Z^{(\lambda)}{\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, where the multiplicative correction, ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, is an expectation over a node-independent probability distribution built from node-wise fractional marginals. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive experiments with models from Ising ensembles over planar and random graphs of medium- and large-sizes. The empirical study yields a number of interesting observations, such as the ability to estimate ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$ with $O(N^{2::4})$ fractional samples and suppression of $\lambda_*$ fluctuations with an increase in $N$ for instances from a particular random Ising ensemble. We also verify and discuss the applicability of this approach to the problem of image de-noising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Siahkoohi, Rudy Morel, Randall Balestriero, Erwan Allys, Gr\'egory Sainton, Taichi Kawamura, Maarten V. de Hoop</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Wang, Weizi Li, Anthony Bradlow, Antoni T. Y. Chan, Eghosa Bazuaye</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of inflammatory arthritis (IA) is critical to efficient and accurate hospital referral triage for timely treatment and preventing the deterioration of the IA disease course, especially under limited healthcare resources. The manual assessment process is the most common approach in practice for the early detection of IA, but it is extremely labor-intensive and inefficient. A large amount of clinical information needs to be assessed for every referral from General Practice (GP) to the hospitals. Machine learning shows great potential in automating repetitive assessment tasks and providing decision support for the early detection of IA. However, most machine learning-based methods for IA detection rely on blood testing results. But in practice, blood testing data is not always available at the point of referrals, so we need methods to leverage multimodal data such as semi-structured and unstructured data for early detection of IA. In this research, we present fusion and ensemble learning-based methods using multimodal data to assist decision-making in the early detection of IA, and a conformal prediction-based method to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction and detect any unreliable predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to utilize multimodal data to support the early detection of IA from GP referrals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daesoo Lee, Sara Malacarne, Erlend Aune</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel time series anomaly detection method that achieves excellent detection accuracy while offering a superior level of explainability. Our proposed method, TimeVQVAE-AD, leverages masked generative modeling adapted from the cutting-edge time series generation method known as TimeVQVAE. The prior model is trained on the discrete latent space of a time-frequency domain. Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time-frequency domain are preserved in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies. Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals. Our experimental evaluation on the UCR Time Series Anomaly archive demonstrates that TimeVQVAE-AD significantly surpasses the existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. We provide our implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE-AnomalyDetection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su Jia, Fatemeh Navidi, Viswanath Nagarajan, R. Ravi</p>
<p>Abstract: In pool-based active learning, the learner is given an unlabeled data set and aims to efficiently learn the unknown hypothesis by querying the labels of the data points. This can be formulated as the classical Optimal Decision Tree (ODT) problem: Given a set of tests, a set of hypotheses, and an outcome for each pair of test and hypothesis, our objective is to find a low-cost testing procedure (i.e., decision tree) that identifies the true hypothesis. This optimization problem has been extensively studied under the assumption that each test generates a deterministic outcome. However, in numerous applications, for example, clinical trials, the outcomes may be uncertain, which renders the ideas from the deterministic setting invalid. In this work, we study a fundamental variant of the ODT problem in which some test outcomes are noisy, even in the more general case where the noise is persistent, i.e., repeating a test gives the same noisy output. Our approximation algorithms provide guarantees that are nearly best possible and hold for the general case of a large number of noisy outcomes per test or per hypothesis where the performance degrades continuously with this number. We numerically evaluated our algorithms for identifying toxic chemicals and learning linear classifiers, and observed that our algorithms have costs very close to the information-theoretic minimum.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongcun Song, Ziqi Wang, Enrique Zuazua</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for learning from distributed data while maintaining privacy. The development of efficient FL algorithms encounters various challenges, including heterogeneous data and systems, limited communication capacities, and constrained local computational resources. Recently developed FedADMM methods show great resilience to both data and system heterogeneity. However, they still suffer from performance deterioration if the hyperparameters are not carefully tuned. To address this issue, we propose an inexact and self-adaptive FedADMM algorithm, termed FedADMM-InSa. First, we design an inexactness criterion for the clients' local updates to eliminate the need for empirically setting the local training accuracy. This inexactness criterion can be assessed by each client independently based on its unique condition, thereby reducing the local computational cost and mitigating the undesirable straggle effect. The convergence of the resulting inexact ADMM is proved under the assumption of strongly convex loss functions. Additionally, we present a self-adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts each client's penalty parameter, enhancing algorithm robustness by mitigating the need for empirical penalty parameter choices for each client. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted. As validated by some numerical tests, our proposed algorithm can reduce the clients' local computational load significantly and also accelerate the learning process compared to the vanilla FedADMM.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose training fitted Q-iteration with log-loss (FQI-log) for batch reinforcement learning (RL). We show that the number of samples needed to learn a near-optimal policy with FQI-log scales with the accumulated cost of the optimal policy, which is zero in problems where acting optimally achieves the goal and incurs no cost. In doing so, we provide a general framework for proving small-cost bounds, i.e. bounds that scale with the optimal achievable cost, in batch RL. Moreover, we empirically verify that FQI-log uses fewer samples than FQI trained with squared loss on problems where the optimal policy reliably achieves the goal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harshavardhan Adepu, Zhanpeng Zeng, Li Zhang, Vikas Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are the backbone of powerful foundation models for many Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. But their compute and memory/storage footprint is large, and so, serving such models is expensive often requiring high-end hardware. To mitigate this difficulty, Post-Training Quantization seeks to modify a pre-trained model and quantize it to eight bits or lower, significantly boosting compute/memory/latency efficiency. Such models have been successfully quantized to four bits with some performance loss. In this work, we outline a simple scheme to quantize Transformer-based models to just two bits (plus some overhead) with only a small drop in accuracy. Key to our formulation is a concept borrowed from Harmonic analysis called Fusion Frames. Our main finding is that the quantization must take place not in the original weight space, but instead in the Fusion Frame representations. If quantization is interpreted as the addition of noise, our casting of the problem allows invoking an extensive body of known consistent recovery and noise robustness guarantees. Further, if desired, de-noising filters are known in closed form. We show empirically, via a variety of experiments, that (almost) two-bit quantization for Transformer models promises sizable efficiency gains.

<p>Abstract: A key challenge in federated learning applications is the statistical heterogeneity of local datasets. Clustered federated learning addresses this challenge by identifying clusters of local datasets that are approximately homogeneous. One recent approach to clustered federated learning is generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin). This approach requires a similarity graph which can be obtained by domain expertise or in a data-driven fashion via graph learning techniques. Under a widely applicable clustering assumption, we derive an upper bound the deviation between GTVMin solutions and their cluster-wise averages. This bound provides valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of GTVMin in addressing statistical heterogeneity within federated learning environments.</p>

UPS embeds different PDEs into a shared representation space and processes them using a FNO-transformer architecture. Rather than training the network from scratch, which is data-demanding and computationally expensive, we warm-start the transformer from pretrained LLMs and perform explicit alignment to reduce the modality gap while improving data and compute efficiency. The cross-modal UPS achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of 1D and 2D PDE families from PDEBench, outperforming existing unified models using 4 times less data and 26 times less compute. Meanwhile, it is capable of few-shot transfer to unseen PDE families and coefficients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen Zhao, Yixin Su, Yuhua Li, Yixiong Zou, Ruixuan Li, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) is now a go-to method for pre-training graph foundation models (GFMs). There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patricia A. Apell\'aniz, Ana Jim\'enez, Borja Arroyo Galende, Juan Parras, Santiago Zazo</p>
<p>Abstract: The ever-increasing use of generative models in various fields where tabular data is used highlights the need for robust and standardized validation metrics to assess the similarity between real and synthetic data. Current methods lack a unified framework and rely on diverse and often inconclusive statistical measures. Divergences, which quantify discrepancies between data distributions, offer a promising avenue for validation. However, traditional approaches calculate divergences independently for each feature due to the complexity of joint distribution modeling. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel approach that uses divergence estimation to overcome the limitations of marginal comparisons. Our core contribution lies in applying a divergence estimator to build a validation metric considering the joint distribution of real and synthetic data. We leverage a probabilistic classifier to approximate the density ratio between datasets, allowing the capture of complex relationships. We specifically calculate two divergences: the well-known Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. KL divergence offers an established use in the field, while JS divergence is symmetric and bounded, providing a reliable metric. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments with varying distribution complexities. The initial phase involves comparing estimated divergences with analytical solutions for simple distributions, setting a benchmark for accuracy. Finally, we validate our method on a real-world dataset and its corresponding synthetic counterpart, showcasing its effectiveness in practical applications. This research offers a significant contribution with applicability beyond tabular data and the potential to improve synthetic data validation in various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Mert \c{C}elikok, Frans A. Oliehoek, Jan-Willem van de Meent</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We present initial query and sample complexity results for the I-CURL problem under assumptions such as Lipschitz-continuity. Finally, we outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B. N. Kausik</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning neural network models must be large enough to adapt to their problem domain, while small enough to avoid overfitting training data during gradient descent. To balance these competing demands, overprovisioned deep learning models such as transformers are trained for a single epoch on large data sets, and hence inefficient with both computing resources and training data. In response to these inefficiencies, we exploit learning theory to derive Occam Gradient Descent, an algorithm that interleaves adaptive reduction of model size to minimize generalization error, with gradient descent on model weights to minimize fitting error. In contrast, traditional gradient descent greedily minimizes fitting error without regard to generalization error. Our algorithm simultaneously descends the space of weights and topological size of any neural network without modification. With respect to loss, compute and model size, our experiments show (a) on image classification benchmarks, linear and convolutional neural networks trained with Occam Gradient Descent outperform traditional gradient descent with or without post-train pruning; (b) on a range of tabular data classification tasks, neural networks trained with Occam Gradient Descent outperform traditional gradient descent, as well as Random Forests; (c) on natural language transformers, Occam Gradient Descent outperforms traditional gradient descent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantization is a proven effective method for compressing large language models. Although popular techniques like W8A8 and W4A16 effectively maintain model performance, they often fail to concurrently speed up the prefill and decoding stages of inference. W4A8 is a promising strategy to accelerate both of them while usually leads to a significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we present QQQ, a Quality Quattuor-bit Quantization method with 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations. QQQ employs adaptive smoothing and Hessian-based compensation, significantly enhancing the performance of quantized models without extensive training. Furthermore, we meticulously engineer W4A8 GEMM kernels to increase inference speed. Our specialized per-channel W4A8 GEMM and per-group W4A8 GEMM achieve impressive speed increases of 3.67$\times$ and 3.29 $\times$ over FP16 GEMM. Our extensive experiments show that QQQ achieves performance on par with existing state-of-the-art LLM quantization methods while significantly accelerating inference, achieving speed boosts up to 2.24 $\times$, 2.10$\times$, and 1.25$\times$ compared to FP16, W8A8, and W4A16, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet Duong, Qiong Wu, Zhengyi Zhou, Hongjue Zhao, Chenxiang Luo, Eric Zavesky, Huaxiu Yao, Huajie Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: As an emerging interpretable technique, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) adopt neural networks to individually learn non-linear functions for each feature, which are then combined through a linear model for final predictions. Although GAMs can explain deep neural networks (DNNs) at the feature level, they require large numbers of model parameters and are prone to overfitting, making them hard to train and scale. Additionally, in real-world datasets with many features, the interpretability of feature-based explanations diminishes for humans. To tackle these issues, recent research has shifted towards concept-based interpretable methods. These approaches try to integrate concept learning as an intermediate step before making predictions, explaining the predictions in terms of human-understandable concepts. However, these methods require domain experts to extensively label concepts with relevant names and their ground-truth values. In response, we propose CAT, a novel interpretable Concept-bAsed Taylor additive model to simply this process. CAT does not have to require domain experts to annotate concepts and their ground-truth values. Instead, it only requires users to simply categorize input features into broad groups, which can be easily accomplished through a quick metadata review. Specifically, CAT first embeds each group of input features into one-dimensional high-level concept representation, and then feeds the concept representations into a new white-box Taylor Neural Network (TaylorNet). The TaylorNet aims to learn the non-linear relationship between the inputs and outputs using polynomials. Evaluation results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CAT can outperform or compete with the baselines while reducing the need of extensive model parameters. Importantly, it can explain model predictions through high-level concepts that human can understand.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Wang, Zhankun Xiong, Feng Huang, Xuan Liu, Wen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can result in various pharmacological changes, which can be categorized into different classes known as DDI events (DDIEs). In recent years, previously unobserved/unseen DDIEs have been emerging, posing a new classification task when unseen classes have no labelled instances in the training stage, which is formulated as a zero-shot DDIE prediction (ZS-DDIE) task. However, existing computational methods are not directly applicable to ZS-DDIE, which has two primary challenges: obtaining suitable DDIE representations and handling the class imbalance issue. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method named ZeroDDI for the ZS-DDIE task. Specifically, we design a biological semantic enhanced DDIE representation learning module, which emphasizes the key biological semantics and distills discriminative molecular substructure-related semantics for DDIE representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a dual-modal uniform alignment strategy to distribute drug pair representations and DDIE semantic representations uniformly in a unit sphere and align the matched ones, which can mitigate the issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments showed that ZeroDDI surpasses the baselines and indicate that it is a promising tool for detecting unseen DDIEs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Kedziora</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning ensembles predictions from multiple models are aggregated. Despite widespread use and strong performance of ensembles in applied problems little is known about the mathematical properties of aggregating models and associated consequences for safe, explainable use of such models. In this paper we prove a theorem that shows that any ensemble will exhibit at least one of the following forms of prediction instability. It will either ignore agreement among all underlying models, change its mind when none of the underlying models have done so, or be manipulable through inclusion or exclusion of options it would never actually predict. As a consequence, ensemble aggregation procedures will always need to balance the benefits of information use against the risk of these prediction instabilities. This analysis also sheds light on what specific forms of prediction instability to expect from particular ensemble algorithms; for example popular tree ensembles like random forest, or xgboost will violate basic, intuitive fairness properties. Finally, we show that this can be ameliorated by using consistent models in asymptotic conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving regression in machine learning is a crucial area of research, aimed at enabling the use of powerful machine learning techniques while protecting individuals' privacy. In this paper, we implement privacy-preserving regression training using data encrypted under a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We first examine the common linear regression algorithm and propose a (simplified) fixed Hessian for linear regression training, which can be applied for any datasets even not normalized into the range $[0, 1]$. We also generalize this constant Hessian matrix to the ridge regression version, namely linear regression which includes a regularization term to penalize large coefficients. However, our main contribution is to develop a novel and efficient algorithm called LFFR for homomorphic regression using the logistic function, which could model more complex relations between input values and output prediction in comparison with linear regression. We also find a constant simplified Hessian to train our LFFR algorithm using the Newton-like method and compare it against to with our new fixed Hessian linear regression training over two real-world datasets. We suggest normalizing not only the data but also the target predictions even for the original linear regression used in a privacy-preserving manner, which is helpful to remain weights in a small range, say $[-5, +5]$ good for refreshing ciphertext setting parameters, and avoid tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$ via cross validation. The linear regression with normalized predictions could be a viable alternative to ridge regression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengzhi Lin, Shuchang Liu, Chuyuan Wang, Yongqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting watch time is crucial for optimizing recommendations and user experience in short video platforms. However, existing methods that estimate a single average watch time often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty and diversity in user engagement patterns. In this paper, we propose the Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE) framework to model the entire conditional distribution of watch time. Using quantile regression, CQE characterizes the complex watch-time distribution for each user-video pair, providing a flexible and comprehensive approach to understanding user behavior. We further design multiple strategies to combine the quantile estimates, adapting to different recommendation scenarios and user preferences. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the superiority of CQE in watch time prediction and user engagement modeling. In particular, the online deployment of CQE in KuaiShow has led to significant improvements in key evaluation metrics, including active days, active users, engagement duration, and video view counts. These results highlight the practical impact of our proposed approach in enhancing the user experience and overall performance of the short video recommendation system. The code will be released after publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Marwah, Asad Narayanan, Stephan Jou, Martin Arlitt, Maria Pospelova</p>
<p>Abstract: The cost of errors related to machine learning classifiers, namely, false positives and false negatives, are not equal and are application dependent. For example, in cybersecurity applications, the cost of not detecting an attack is very different from marking a benign activity as an attack. Various design choices during machine learning model building, such as hyperparameter tuning and model selection, allow a data scientist to trade-off between these two errors. However, most of the commonly used metrics to evaluate model quality, such as $F_1$ score, which is defined in terms of model precision and recall, treat both these errors equally, making it difficult for users to optimize for the actual cost of these errors. In this paper, we propose a new cost-aware metric, $C_{score}$ based on precision and recall that can replace $F_1$ score for model evaluation and selection. It includes a cost ratio that takes into account the differing costs of handling false positives and false negatives. We derive and characterize the new cost metric, and compare it to $F_1$ score. Further, we use this metric for model thresholding for five cybersecurity related datasets for multiple cost ratios. The results show an average cost savings of 49%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aki H\"arm\"a, Marcin Pietrasik, Anna Wilbik</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pretrained self-attention neural networks, or transformers, have been very successful in various tasks recently. The performance of a model on a given task depends on its ability to memorize and generalize the training data. Large transformer models, which may have billions of parameters, in theory have a huge capacity to memorize content. However, the current algorithms for the optimization fall short of the theoretical capacity, and the capacity is also highly dependent on the content. In this paper, we focus on the memory capacity of these models obtained using common training algorithms and synthetic training data. Based on the results, we derive an empirical capacity model (ECM) for a generic transformer. The ECM can be used to design task-specific transformer models with an optimal number of parameters in cases where the target memorization capability of the task can be defined.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huixiu Jiang, Ling Yang, Yu Bao, Rutong Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizer plays an important role in neural network training with high efficiency and performance. Weight update based on its gradient is the central part of the optimizer. It has been shown that normalization and standardization operation on weight and gradient can accelerate the training process and improve performance such as Weight Standardization (WS), weight normalization (WN) and gradient normalization (GN); there is also gradient centralization (GC). In this work, we introduce a new optimization technique based on the gradient magnitude in a gradient vector named adaptive gradient regularization (AGR), which normalizes the gradient vector in all dimensions as a coefficient vector and subtracts the product of the gradient and its coefficient vector by the vanilla gradient. It can be viewed as an adaptive gradient clipping method. We show that the AGR can improve the loss function Lipschitzness with a more stable training process and better generalization performance. AGR is very simple to be embedded into vanilla optimizers such as Adan and AdamW with only three lines of code. Our experiments are conducted in image generation, image classification and language representation, which shows that our AGR improves the training result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanyoung Jung, Yun Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers have been persistently working to address the issue of missing values in time series data. Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Pang, Changqing Lin, Xiaoshuai Hao, Rong Yin, Zixuan Wang, Zhihui Zhang, Jinglin He, Huang Tai Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual graph learning (CGL) is an important and challenging task that aims to extend static GNNs to dynamic task flow scenarios. As one of the mainstream CGL methods, the experience replay (ER) method receives widespread attention due to its superior performance. However, existing ER methods focus on identifying samples by feature significance or topological relevance, which limits their utilization of comprehensive graph data. In addition, the topology-based ER methods only consider local topological information and add neighboring nodes to the buffer, which ignores the global topological information and increases memory overhead. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel method called Feature-Topology Fusion-based Experience Replay (FTF-ER) to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue with enhanced efficiency. Specifically, from an overall perspective to maximize the utilization of the entire graph data, we propose a highly complementary approach including both feature and global topological information, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of the sampled nodes. Moreover, to further utilize global topological information, we propose Hodge Potential Score (HPS) as a novel module to calculate the topological importance of nodes. HPS derives a global node ranking via Hodge decomposition on graphs, providing more accurate global topological information compared to neighbor sampling. By excluding neighbor sampling, HPS significantly reduces buffer storage costs for acquiring topological information and simultaneously decreases training time. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, FTF-ER achieves a significant improvement of 3.6% in AA and 7.1% in AF on the OGB-Arxiv dataset, demonstrating its superior performance in the class-incremental learning setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Yang, Biwei Huang, Fan Feng, Xinyue Wang, Shikui Tu, Lei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: General intelligence requires quick adaption across tasks. While existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods have made progress in generalization, they typically assume only distribution changes between source and target domains. In this paper, we explore a wider range of scenarios where both the distribution and environment spaces may change. For example, in Atari games, we train agents to generalize to tasks with different levels of mode and difficulty, where there could be new state or action variables that never occurred in previous environments. To address this challenging setting, we introduce a causality-guided self-adaptive representation-based approach, called CSR, that equips the agent to generalize effectively and efficiently across a sequence of tasks with evolving dynamics. Specifically, we employ causal representation learning to characterize the latent causal variables and world models within the RL system. Such compact causal representations uncover the structural relationships among variables, enabling the agent to autonomously determine whether changes in the environment stem from distribution shifts or variations in space, and to precisely locate these changes. We then devise a three-step strategy to fine-tune the model under different scenarios accordingly. Empirical experiments show that CSR efficiently adapts to the target domains with only a few samples and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of scenarios, including our simulated environments, Cartpole, and Atari games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Chen, Senmiao Wang, Zhihang Lin, Zeyu Qin, Yushun Zhang, Tian Ding, Ruoyu Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks. Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes. Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting. Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages. First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data. This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function. This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</p>

In this paper, motivated by a study in Euclidean distance geometry, we explore a dual basis approach to CMDS. We give an explicit formula for the dual basis vectors and fully characterize the spectrum of an essential matrix in the dual basis framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sewon Min, Suchin Gururangan, Eric Wallace, Weijia Shi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Noah A. Smith, Luke Zettlemoyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The legality of training language models (LMs) on copyrighted or otherwise restricted data is under intense debate. However, as we show, model performance significantly degrades if trained only on low-risk text (e.g., out-of-copyright books or government documents), due to its limited size and domain coverage. We present SILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff during inference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on Open License Corpus (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and permissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily modifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news) that is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk data without training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and enables data producers to opt out from the model by removing content from the store. These capabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such as the fair use doctrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European Union. Our experiments show that the parametric LM struggles on domains not covered by OLC. However, access to the datastore greatly improves out of domain performance, closing 90% of the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile, a more diverse corpus with mostly high-risk text. We also analyze which nonparametric approach works best, where the remaining errors lie, and how performance scales with datastore size. Our results suggest that it is possible to build high quality language models while mitigating their legal risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming-Chih Lai, Yongcun Song, Xiaoming Yuan, Hangrui Yue, Tianyou Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), in combination with some recently developed discontinuity capturing neural networks, can be applied to solve optimal control problems subject to partial differential equations (PDEs) with interfaces and some control constraints. The resulting algorithm is mesh-free and scalable to different PDEs, and it ensures the control constraints rigorously. Since the boundary and interface conditions, as well as the PDEs, are all treated as soft constraints by lumping them into a weighted loss function, it is necessary to learn them simultaneously and there is no guarantee that the boundary and interface conditions can be satisfied exactly. This immediately causes difficulties in tuning the weights in the corresponding loss function and training the neural networks. To tackle these difficulties and guarantee the numerical accuracy, we propose to impose the boundary and interface conditions as hard constraints in PINNs by developing a novel neural network architecture. The resulting hard-constraint PINNs approach guarantees that both the boundary and interface conditions can be satisfied exactly or with a high degree of accuracy, and they are decoupled from the learning of the PDEs. Its efficiency is promisingly validated by some elliptic and parabolic interface optimal control problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have surpassed human intelligence in a variety of computational tasks. However, AI systems, like humans, make mistakes, have blind spots, hallucinate, and struggle to generalize to new situations. This work explores whether AI can benefit from creative decision-making mechanisms when pushed to the limits of its computational rationality. In particular, we investigate whether a team of diverse AI systems can outperform a single AI in challenging tasks by generating more ideas as a group and then selecting the best ones. We study this question in the game of chess, the so-called drosophila of AI. We build on AlphaZero (AZ) and extend it to represent a league of agents via a latent-conditioned architecture, which we call AZ_db. We train AZ_db to generate a wider range of ideas using behavioral diversity techniques and select the most promising ones with sub-additive planning. Our experiments suggest that AZ_db plays chess in diverse ways, solves more puzzles as a group and outperforms a more homogeneous team. Notably, AZ_db solves twice as many challenging puzzles as AZ, including the challenging Penrose positions. When playing chess from different openings, we notice that players in AZ_db specialize in different openings, and that selecting a player for each opening using sub-additive planning results in a 50 Elo improvement over AZ. Our findings suggest that diversity bonuses emerge in teams of AI agents, just as they do in teams of humans and that diversity is a valuable asset in solving computationally hard problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristina Gligoric, Tiziano Piccardi, Jake Hofman, Robert West</p>
<p>Abstract: Science is facing a reproducibility crisis. Previous work has proposed incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students, educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve the state of science?
  In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL (N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities, such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.
  Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and students.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing and optimizing optical amplifiers to maximize system performance is becoming increasingly important as optical communication systems strive to increase throughput. Offline optimization of optical amplifiers relies on models ranging from white-box models deeply rooted in physics to black-box data-driven and physics-agnostic models. Here, we compare the capabilities of white-, grey- and black-box models on the challenging test case of optimizing a bidirectional distributed Raman amplifier to achieve a target frequency-distance signal power profile. We show that any of the studied methods can achieve similar frequency and distance flatness of between 1 and 3.6 dB (depending on the definition of flatness) over the C-band in an 80-km span. Then, we discuss the models' applicability, advantages, and drawbacks based on the target application scenario, in particular in terms of flexibility, optimization speed, and access to training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keaton Hamm, Caroline Moosm\"uller, Bernhard Schmitzer, Matthew Thorpe</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims at building the theoretical foundations for manifold learning algorithms in the space of absolutely continuous probability measures on a compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, metrized with the Wasserstein-2 distance $\mathrm{W}$. We begin by introducing a construction of submanifolds $\Lambda$ of probability measures equipped with metric $\mathrm{W}_\Lambda$, the geodesic restriction of $W$ to $\Lambda$. In contrast to other constructions, these submanifolds are not necessarily flat, but still allow for local linearizations in a similar fashion to Riemannian submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show how the latent manifold structure of $(\Lambda,\mathrm{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be learned from samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of $\Lambda$ and pairwise extrinsic Wasserstein distances $\mathrm{W}$ only. In particular, we show that the metric space $(\Lambda,\mathrm{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be asymptotically recovered in the sense of Gromov--Wasserstein from a graph with nodes $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and edge weights $W(\lambda_i,\lambda_j)$. In addition, we demonstrate how the tangent space at a sample $\lambda$ can be asymptotically recovered via spectral analysis of a suitable "covariance operator" using optimal transport maps from $\lambda$ to sufficiently close and diverse samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$. The paper closes with some explicit constructions of submanifolds $\Lambda$ and numerical examples on the recovery of tangent spaces through spectral analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lichtenberg, Abiy Tasissa</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of determining the configuration of $n$ points by using their distances to $m$ nodes, referred to as anchor nodes. One sampling scheme is Nystrom sampling, which assumes known distances between the anchors and between the anchors and the $n$ points, while the distances among the $n$ points are unknown. For this scheme, a simple adaptation of the Nystrom method, which is often used for kernel approximation, is a viable technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the $n$ points. In this manuscript, we propose a modified version of Nystrom sampling, where the distances from every node to one central node are known, but all other distances are incomplete. In this setting, the standard Nystrom approach is not applicable, necessitating an alternative technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the $n$ points. We show that this problem can be framed as the recovery of a low-rank submatrix of a Gram matrix. Using synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can exactly recover configurations of points given sufficient distance samples. This underscores that, in contrast to methods that rely on global sampling of distance matrices, the task of estimating the configuration of points can be done efficiently via structured sampling with well-chosen reliable anchors. Finally, our main analysis is grounded in a specific centering of the points. With this in mind, we extend previous work in Euclidean distance geometry by providing a general dual basis approach for points centered anywhere.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tob\'ias I. Liaudat, Matthijs Mars, Matthew A. Price, Marcelo Pereyra, Marta M. Betcke, Jason D. McEwen</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array have the potential to unlock scientific discoveries thanks to their unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. One key to unlocking their potential resides in handling the deluge and complexity of incoming data. This challenge requires building radio interferometric imaging methods that can cope with the massive data sizes and provide high-quality image reconstructions with uncertainty quantification (UQ). This work proposes a method coined QuantifAI to address UQ in radio-interferometric imaging with data-driven (learned) priors for high-dimensional settings. Our model, rooted in the Bayesian framework, uses a physically motivated model for the likelihood. The model exploits a data-driven convex prior, which can encode complex information learned implicitly from simulations and guarantee the log-concavity of the posterior. We leverage probability concentration phenomena of high-dimensional log-concave posteriors that let us obtain information about the posterior, avoiding MCMC sampling techniques. We rely on convex optimisation methods to compute the MAP estimation, which is known to be faster and better scale with dimension than MCMC sampling strategies. Our method allows us to compute local credible intervals, i.e., Bayesian error bars, and perform hypothesis testing of structure on the reconstructed image. In addition, we propose a novel blazing-fast method to compute pixel-wise uncertainties at different scales. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing radio-interferometric images in a simulated setting and carrying out fast and scalable UQ, which we validate with MCMC sampling. Our method shows an improved image quality and more meaningful uncertainties than the benchmark method based on a sparsity-promoting prior.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Yuan, Haichuan Che, Yuzhe Qin, Binghao Huang, Zhao-Heng Yin, Kang-Won Lee, Yi Wu, Soo-Chul Lim, Xiaolong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Executing contact-rich manipulation tasks necessitates the fusion of tactile and visual feedback. However, the distinct nature of these modalities poses significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce a system that leverages visual and tactile sensory inputs to enable dexterous in-hand manipulation. Specifically, we propose Robot Synesthesia, a novel point cloud-based tactile representation inspired by human tactile-visual synesthesia. This approach allows for the simultaneous and seamless integration of both sensory inputs, offering richer spatial information and facilitating better reasoning about robot actions. The method, trained in a simulated environment and then deployed to a real robot, is applicable to various in-hand object rotation tasks. Comprehensive ablations are performed on how the integration of vision and touch can improve reinforcement learning and Sim2Real performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keivan Alizadeh, Iman Mirzadeh, Dmitry Belenko, Karen Khatamifard, Minsik Cho, Carlo C Del Mundo, Mohammad Rastegari, Mehrdad Farajtabar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, "windowing" strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, "row-column bundling", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenbang Xiao, Shunyu Liu, Yu Wang, Tongya Zheng, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to save the expensive training costs of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by substituting a condensed small graph with the original graph. Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs. Moreover, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the Ogbn-papers100M graph with flexible reduction rates. Extensive downstream tasks and ablation study on five common datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DisCo framework. The source code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Langtry, Vijja Wichitwechkarn, Rebecca Ward, Chaoqun Zhuang, Monika J. Kreitmair, Nikolas Makasis, Zack Xuereb Conti, Ruchi Choudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Data is required to develop forecasting models for use in Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes in building energy systems. However, data is costly to both collect and exploit. Determining cost optimal data usage strategies requires understanding of the forecast accuracy and resulting MPC operational performance it enables. This study investigates the performance of both simple and state-of-the-art machine learning prediction models for MPC in multi-building energy systems using a simulated case study with historic building energy data. The impact on forecast accuracy of measures to improve model data efficiency are quantified, specifically for: reuse of prediction models, reduction of training data duration, reduction of model data features, and online model training. A simple linear multi-layer perceptron model is shown to provide equivalent forecast accuracy to state-of-the-art models, with greater data efficiency and generalisability. The use of more than 2 years of training data for load prediction models provided no significant improvement in forecast accuracy. Forecast accuracy and data efficiency were improved simultaneously by using change-point analysis to screen training data. Reused models and those trained with 3 months of data had on average 10% higher error than baseline, indicating that deploying MPC systems without prior data collection may be economic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Adiga, Lakshminarayanan Subramanian, Varun Chandrasekaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable few-shot learning capabilities when provided with properly formatted examples. However, selecting the "best" examples remains an open challenge. We propose a complexity-based prompt selection approach for sequence tagging tasks. This approach avoids the training of a dedicated model for selection of examples, and instead uses certain metrics to align the syntactico-semantic complexity of test sentences and examples. We use both sentence- and word-level metrics to match the complexity of examples to the (test) sentence being considered. Our results demonstrate that our approach extracts greater performance from PLMs: it achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot NER, achieving a 5% absolute improvement in F1 score on the CoNLL2003 dataset for GPT-4. We also see large gains of upto 28.85 points (F1/Acc.) in smaller models like GPT-j-6B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Xiong, Xiaohan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of information overload, the value of recommender systems has been profoundly recognized in academia and industry alike. Multi-interest sequential recommendation, in particular, is a subfield that has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. By generating multiple-user representations, multi-interest learning models demonstrate superior expressiveness than single-user representation models, both theoretically and empirically. Despite major advancements in the field, three major issues continue to plague the performance and adoptability of multi-interest learning methods, the difference between training and deployment objectives, the inability to access item information, and the difficulty of industrial adoption due to its single-tower architecture. We address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-tower multi-interest framework with user representation repel. Experimental results across multiple large-scale industrial datasets proved the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Zheng, Anurag Ghosh, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Driving is challenging in conditions like night, rain, and snow. The lack of good labeled datasets has hampered progress in scene understanding under such conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) using large labeled clear-day datasets is a promising research direction in such cases. Current UDA methods, however, treat all image pixels uniformly, leading to over-reliance on the dominant scene backgrounds (e.g., roads, sky, sidewalks) that appear dramatically different across domains. As a result, they struggle to learn effective features of smaller and often sparse foreground objects (e.g., people, vehicles, signs).
  In this work, we improve UDA training by using in-place image warping to focus on salient object regions. Our insight is that while backgrounds vary significantly across domains (e.g., snowy night vs. clear day), object appearances vary to a lesser extent. Therefore, we design instance-level saliency guidance to adaptively oversample object regions, which reduces adverse effects from background context and enhances backbone feature learning. We then unwarp the better learned features while adapting from source to target. Our approach improves adaptation across geographies, lighting, and weather conditions, and is agnostic to the task (segmentation, detection), domain adaptation algorithm, saliency guidance, and underlying model architecture. Result highlights include +6.1 mAP50 for BDD100K Clear $\rightarrow$ DENSE Foggy, +3.7 mAP50 for BDD100K Day $\rightarrow$ Night, +3.0 mAP50 for BDD100K Clear $\rightarrow$ Rainy, and +6.3 mIoU for Cityscapes $\rightarrow$ ACDC. Our method adds minimal training memory and incurs no additional inference latency. Please see Appendix for more results and analysis.</p>

This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize hybrid time series prediction model, specifically combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ARIMA, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days.

<p>Abstract: Deep nonparametric regression, characterized by the utilization of deep neural networks to learn target functions, has emerged as a focus of research attention in recent years. Despite considerable progress in understanding convergence rates, the absence of asymptotic properties hinders rigorous statistical inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that transforms the deep estimation paradigm into a platform conducive to conditional mean estimation, leveraging the conditional diffusion model. Theoretically, we develop an end-to-end convergence rate for the conditional diffusion model and establish the asymptotic normality of the generated samples. Consequently, we are equipped to construct confidence regions, facilitating robust statistical inference. Furthermore, through numerical experiments, we empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed methodology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Naranjo-Alcazar, Jordi Grau-Haro, Ruben Ribes-Serrano, Pedro Zuccarello</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Listening focuses on developing technologies to extract relevant information from audio signals. A critical aspect of these projects is the acquisition and labeling of contextualized data, which is inherently complex and requires specific resources and strategies. Despite the availability of some audio datasets, many are unsuitable for commercial applications. The paper emphasizes the importance of Active Learning (AL) using expert labelers over crowdsourcing, which often lacks detailed insights into dataset structures. AL is an iterative process combining human labelers and AI models to optimize the labeling budget by intelligently selecting samples for human review. This approach addresses the challenge of handling large, constantly growing datasets that exceed available computational resources and memory. The paper presents a comprehensive data-centric framework for Machine Listening projects, detailing the configuration of recording nodes, database structure, and labeling budget optimization in resource-constrained scenarios. Applied to an industrial port in Valencia, Spain, the framework successfully labeled 6540 ten-second audio samples over five months with a small team, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability to various resource availability situations.

<p>Abstract: Inner Interpretability is a promising emerging field tasked with uncovering the inner mechanisms of AI systems, though how to develop these mechanistic theories is still much debated. Moreover, recent critiques raise issues that question its usefulness to advance the broader goals of AI. However, it has been overlooked that these issues resemble those that have been grappled with in another field: Cognitive Neuroscience. Here we draw the relevant connections and highlight lessons that can be transferred productively between fields. Based on these, we propose a general conceptual framework and give concrete methodological strategies for building mechanistic explanations in AI inner interpretability research. With this conceptual framework, Inner Interpretability can fend off critiques and position itself on a productive path to explain AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal interleaved datasets featuring free-form interleaved sequences of images and text are crucial for training frontier large multimodal models (LMMs). Despite the rapid progression of open-source LMMs, there remains a pronounced scarcity of large-scale, diverse open-source multimodal interleaved datasets. In response, we introduce MINT-1T, the most extensive and diverse open-source Multimodal INTerleaved dataset to date. MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and 3.4 billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community. Our experiments show that LMMs trained on MINT-1T rival the performance of models trained on the previous leading dataset, OBELICS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuding Yang, Weidong Guo, Kaitong Yang, Xiangyang Li, Zhuwei Rao, Yu Xu, Di Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: The effective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with precise instructions is essential for their application in diverse real-world scenarios. Current methods focus on enhancing the diversity and complexity of training and evaluation samples, yet they fall short in accurately assessing LLMs' ability to follow similar instruction variants. We introduce an effective data augmentation technique that decomposes complex instructions into simpler sub-components, modifies these, and reconstructs them into new variants, thereby preserves the original instruction's context and complexity while introducing variability, which is critical for training and evaluating LLMs' instruction-following precision. We developed the DeMoRecon dataset using this method to both fine-tune and evaluate LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs fine-tuned with DeMoRecon will gain significant performance boost on both ours and commonly used instructions-following benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Stevens, Vishal Urs, Karthik Selvaraj, Gabriel Torres, Gaurish Lakhanpal</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for computer vision algorithms to accurately assess road features in real-time. This study explores the LaneSegNet architecture, a new approach to lane topology prediction which integrates topological information with lane-line data to provide a more contextual understanding of road environments. The LaneSegNet architecture includes a feature extractor, lane encoder, lane decoder, and prediction head, leveraging components from ResNet-50, BEVFormer, and various attention mechanisms. We experimented with optimizations to the LaneSegNet architecture through feature extractor modification and transformer encoder-decoder stack modification. We found that modifying the encoder and decoder stacks offered an interesting tradeoff between training time and prediction accuracy, with certain combinations showing promising results. Our implementation, trained on a single NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU, found that a 2:4 ratio reduced training time by 22.3% with only a 7.1% drop in mean average precision, while a 4:8 ratio increased training time by only 11.1% but improved mean average precision by a significant 23.7%. These results indicate that strategic hyperparameter tuning can yield substantial improvements depending on the resources of the user. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing LaneSegNet according to available computation power, making it more accessible for users with limited resources and increasing the capabilities for users with more powerful resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is challenging due to precise spatial and temporal coordination required between two arms. While there exist several real-world bimanual systems, there is a lack of simulated benchmarks with a large task diversity for systematically studying bimanual capabilities across a wide range of tabletop tasks. This paper addresses the gap by extending RLBench to bimanual manipulation. We open-source our code and benchmark comprising 13 new tasks with 23 unique task variations, each requiring a high degree of coordination and adaptability. To kickstart the benchmark, we extended several state-of-the art methods to bimanual manipulation and also present a language-conditioned behavioral cloning agent -- PerAct2, which enables the learning and execution of bimanual 6-DoF manipulation tasks. Our novel network architecture efficiently integrates language processing with action prediction, allowing robots to understand and perform complex bimanual tasks in response to user-specified goals.

<p>Abstract: Multi-instrument music transcription aims to convert polyphonic music recordings into musical scores assigned to each instrument. This task is challenging for modeling as it requires simultaneously identifying multiple instruments and transcribing their pitch and precise timing, and the lack of fully annotated data adds to the training difficulties. This paper introduces YourMT3+, a suite of models for enhanced multi-instrument music transcription based on the recent language token decoding approach of MT3. We enhance its encoder by adopting a hierarchical attention transformer in the time-frequency domain and integrating a mixture of experts. To address data limitations, we introduce a new multi-channel decoding method for training with incomplete annotations and propose intra- and cross-stem augmentation for dataset mixing. Our experiments demonstrate direct vocal transcription capabilities, eliminating the need for voice separation pre-processors. Benchmarks across ten public datasets show our models' competitiveness with, or superiority to, existing transcription models. Further testing on pop music recordings highlights the limitations of current models. Fully reproducible code and datasets are available with demos at \url{https://github.com/mimbres/YourMT3}.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these models still have numerous security vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. Therefore, by investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and guide us in developing more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analysis-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and 1.06 Attack Efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit bias can impede patient-provider interactions and lead to inequities in care. Raising awareness is key to reducing such bias, but its manifestations in the social dynamics of patient-provider communication are difficult to detect. In this study, we used automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify social signals in patient-provider interactions. We built an automated pipeline to predict social signals from audio recordings of 782 primary care visits that achieved 90.1% average accuracy across codes, and exhibited fairness in its predictions for white and non-white patients. Applying this pipeline, we identified statistically significant differences in provider communication behavior toward white versus non-white patients. In particular, providers expressed more patient-centered behaviors towards white patients including more warmth, engagement, and attentiveness. Our study underscores the potential of automated tools in identifying subtle communication signals that may be linked with bias and impact healthcare quality and equity.</p>

Nevertheless, prior endeavors have frequently encountered difficulties in simultaneously addressing two crucial aspects: personalized planning within intricate urban settings and enhancing planning performance through data utilization. The challenge arises from the expensive and limited nature of user data, coupled with the scene state space tending towards infinity. These factors contribute to overfitting and poor generalization problems during model training. Henceforth, we propose an instance-based transfer imitation learning approach. This method facilitates knowledge transfer from extensive expert domain data to the user domain, presenting a fundamental resolution to these issues. We initially train a pre-trained model using large-scale expert data. Subsequently, during the fine-tuning phase, we feed the batch data, which comprises expert and user data. Employing the inverse reinforcement learning technique, we extract the style feature distribution from user demonstrations, constructing the regularization term for the approximation of user style. In our experiments, we conducted extensive evaluations of the proposed method. Compared to the baseline methods, our approach mitigates the overfitting issue caused by sparse user data. Furthermore, we discovered that integrating the driving model with a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as a safety protection layer for end-to-end personalized fine-tuning results in superior planning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyun-rae Jo, Dongkun Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.</p>
