<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanne Peereboom, Inga Schwabe, Bennett Kleinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly reach real-world applications, necessitating a better understanding of their behaviour. Their size and complexity complicate traditional assessment methods, causing the emergence of alternative approaches inspired by the field of psychology. Recent studies administering psychometric questionnaires to LLMs report human-like traits in LLMs, potentially influencing LLM behaviour. However, this approach suffers from a validity problem: it presupposes that these traits exist in LLMs and that they are measurable with tools designed for humans. Typical procedures rarely acknowledge the validity problem in LLMs, comparing and interpreting average LLM scores. This study investigates this problem by comparing latent structures of personality between humans and three LLMs using two validated personality questionnaires. Findings suggest that questionnaires designed for humans do not validly measure similar constructs in LLMs, and that these constructs may not exist in LLMs at all, highlighting the need for psychometric analyses of LLM responses to avoid chasing cognitive phantoms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashi Shekhar Kumar, Anurag Harsh, Ritesh Chandra, Sonali Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVDs) is a rapidly rising global concern due to unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, and other factors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), primary risk factors include elevated blood pressure, glucose, blood lipids, and obesity. Recent research has focused on accurate and timely disease prediction to reduce risk and fatalities, often relying on predictive models trained on large datasets, which require intensive training. An intelligent system for CVDs patients could greatly assist in making informed decisions by effectively analyzing health parameters. Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a valuable method for solving real-time challenges by aggregating patterns of interest and their causes and effects on end users. In this work, we propose a fuzzy rule-based system for monitoring clinical data to provide real-time decision support. We designed fuzzy rules based on clinical and WHO standards to ensure accurate predictions. Our integrated approach uses Apache Kafka and Spark for data streaming, and the Siddhi CEP engine for event processing. Additionally, we pass numerous cardiovascular disease-related parameters through CEP engines to ensure fast and reliable prediction decisions. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we simulated real-time, unseen data to predict cardiovascular disease. Using synthetic data (1000 samples), we categorized it into "Very Low Risk, Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk, and Very High Risk." Validation results showed that 20% of samples were categorized as very low risk, 15-45% as low risk, 35-65% as medium risk, 55-85% as high risk, and 75% as very high risk.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15441">Steward: Natural Language Web Automation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Tang, Kang G. Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in serving as the foundation for AI assistants. One emerging application of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI elements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce Steward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a cost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions. Traditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as studying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These frameworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in large-scale or dynamic contexts. Steward addresses these limitations by integrating LLM capabilities with browser automation, allowing for natural language-driven interaction with websites. Steward operates by receiving natural language instructions and reactively planning and executing a sequence of actions on websites, looping until completion, making it a practical tool for developers and researchers to use. It achieves high efficiency, completing actions in 8.52 to 10.14 seconds at a cost of $0.028 per action or an average of $0.18 per task, which is further reduced to 4.8 seconds and $0.022 through a caching mechanism. It runs tasks on real websites with a 40% completion success rate. We discuss various design and implementation challenges, including state representation, action sequence selection, system responsiveness, detecting task completion, and caching implementation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15461">RAM2C: A Liberal Arts Educational Chatbot based on Retrieval-augmented Multi-role Multi-expert Collaboration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Huang, Tong Niu, Rui Yang, Luping Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, many studies focus on utilizing large language models (LLMs) into educational dialogues. Especially, within liberal arts dialogues, educators must balance \textbf{H}umanized communication, \textbf{T}eaching expertise, and \textbf{S}afety-ethics (\textbf{HTS}), besides the subject knowledge itself. However, due to collecting massive amounts of HTS-compliant teaching dialogues from real world as training corpus is expensive, the outputs of existing LLMs in teaching dialogues fall short of human standards. To address this, we design a Retrieval-augmented Multi-role Multi-expert Collaboration (RAM2C) framework to automatically generate such dialogues data. Specifically, we first establish HTS-guided knowledge bases, encompassing three domain knowledge in teaching skills, psychology, and safety ethics. Then, RAM2C organizes LLMs, which are retrieval-augmented by the above different knowledge bases, into multi-experts groups with distinct roles to generate the HTS-compliant educational dialogues dataset. We then fine-tuned the LLMs using this dataset. Empirical evaluations indicate that RM2C-empowered LLMs excel in Chinese reading teaching, offering more personalized, and ethically safe teaching response, demonstrating RAM2C's practicality and high quality. We release the experiments at \hyperlink{https://github.com/ram2c/ram2c}{https://github.com/ram2c/ram2c}.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15503">From Text to Treatment Effects: A Meta-Learning Approach to Handling Text-Based Confounding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Henri Arno, Paloma Rabaey, Thomas Demeester</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the central goals of causal machine learning is the accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data. In recent years, meta-learning has emerged as a flexible, model-agnostic paradigm for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) using any supervised model. This paper examines the performance of meta-learners when the confounding variables are embedded in text. Through synthetic data experiments, we show that learners using pre-trained text representations of confounders, in addition to tabular background variables, achieve improved CATE estimates compare to those relying solely on the tabular variables, particularly when sufficient data is available. However, due to the entangled nature of the text embeddings, these models do not fully match the performance of meta-learners with perfect confounder knowledge. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of pre-trained text representations for causal inference and open up interesting avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woojeong Kim, Ashish Jagmohan, Aditya Vempaty</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in handling tasks that require real-time access to external APIs. While several benchmarks like ToolBench and APIGen have been developed to assess LLMs' API-use capabilities, they often suffer from issues such as lack of generalizability, limited multi-step reasoning coverage, and instability due to real-time API fluctuations. In this paper, we introduce SEAL, an end-to-end testbed designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world API usage. SEAL standardizes existing benchmarks, integrates an agent system for testing API retrieval and planning, and addresses the instability of real-time APIs by introducing a GPT-4-powered API simulator with caching for deterministic evaluations. Our testbed provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that covers API retrieval, API calls, and final responses, offering a reliable framework for structured performance comparison in diverse real-world scenarios. SEAL is publicly available, with ongoing updates for new benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Long, Haotian Shi, Yang Zhou, Xiaopeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear control models have gained extensive application in vehicle control due to their simplicity, ease of use, and support for stability analysis. However, these models lack adaptability to the changing environment and multi-objective settings. Reinforcement learning (RL) models, on the other hand, offer adaptability but suffer from a lack of interpretability and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to develop a family of RL-based controllers enhanced by physics-informed policies, leveraging the advantages of both physics-based models (data-efficient and interpretable) and RL methods (flexible to multiple objectives and fast computing). We propose the Physics-Enhanced Residual Policy Learning (PERPL) framework, where the physics component provides model interpretability and stability. The learning-based Residual Policy adjusts the physics-based policy to adapt to the changing environment, thereby refining the decisions of the physics model. We apply our proposed model to decentralized control to mixed traffic platoon of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) using a constant time gap (CTG) strategy for cruising and incorporating actuator and communication delays. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves smaller headway errors and better oscillation dampening than linear models and RL alone in scenarios with artificially extreme conditions and real preceding vehicle trajectories. At the macroscopic level, overall traffic oscillations are also reduced as the penetration rate of CAVs employing the PERPL scheme increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyue Ou, Frank F. Xu, Aman Madaan, Jiarui Liu, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar, Sudipta Sengupta, Dan Roth, Graham Neubig, Shuyan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs can now act as autonomous agents that interact with digital environments and complete specific objectives (e.g., arranging an online meeting). However, accuracy is still far from satisfactory, partly due to a lack of large-scale, direct demonstrations for digital tasks. Obtaining supervised data from humans is costly, and automatic data collection through exploration or reinforcement learning relies on complex environmental and content setup, resulting in datasets that lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. On the other hand, there is abundant knowledge that may indirectly assist task completion, such as online tutorials that were created for human consumption. In this work, we present Synatra, an approach that effectively transforms this indirect knowledge into direct supervision at scale. We define different types of indirect knowledge, and carefully study the available sources to obtain it, methods to encode the structure of direct demonstrations, and finally methods to transform indirect knowledge into direct demonstrations. We use 100k such synthetically-created demonstrations to finetune a 7B CodeLlama, and demonstrate that the resulting agent surpasses all comparably sized models on three web-based task benchmarks Mind2Web, MiniWoB++ and WebArena, as well as surpassing GPT-3.5 on WebArena and Mind2Web. In addition, while synthetic demonstrations prove to be only 3% the cost of human demonstrations (at $0.031 each), we show that the synthetic demonstrations can be more effective than an identical number of human demonstrations collected from limited domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15657">MMPT: Multimodal Prompt Tuning for Zero-shot Instruction Learning</a></h1>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across a wide range of domains, with increasing emphasis on enhancing their zero-shot generalization capabilities for unseen tasks across various modalities. Instruction tuning has emerged as an effective strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by finetuning pretrained models on diverse multimodal tasks. As the scale of MLLMs continues to grow, parameter-efficient finetuning becomes increasingly critical. However, most existing parameter-efficient approaches focus only on single modalities and often overlook the multimodal characteristics during finetuning. In this work, we introduce a novel Multimodal Prompt Tuning (MMPT) approach for efficient instruction tuning of MLLMs. MMPT effectively integrates visual and textual prompts into the vision encoder and language processor respectively during finetuning, facilitating the extraction and alignment of features across modalities. Empirical results on various multimodal evaluation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. A comprehensive set of ablation studies validates the effectiveness of our prompt design and the efficiency of our approach.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15687">A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Mental Illnesses</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Hanafi, Mohammed Saad, Noureldin Zahran, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in various domains, including healthcare. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in the context of mental health tasks using social media data. We explore the zero-shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) capabilities of various LLMs, including GPT-4, Llama 3, Gemini, and others, on tasks such as binary disorder detection, disorder severity evaluation, and psychiatric knowledge assessment. Our evaluation involved 33 models testing 9 main prompt templates across the tasks. Key findings revealed that models like GPT-4 and Llama 3 exhibited superior performance in binary disorder detection, with accuracies reaching up to 85% on certain datasets. Moreover, prompt engineering played a crucial role in enhancing model performance. Notably, the Mixtral 8x22b model showed an improvement of over 20%, while Gemma 7b experienced a similar boost in performance. In the task of disorder severity evaluation, we observed that FS learning significantly improved the model's accuracy, highlighting the importance of contextual examples in complex assessments. Notably, the Phi-3-mini model exhibited a substantial increase in performance, with balanced accuracy improving by over 6.80% and mean average error dropping by nearly 1.3 when moving from ZS to FS learning. In the psychiatric knowledge task, recent models generally outperformed older, larger counterparts, with the Llama 3.1 405b achieving an accuracy of 91.2%. Despite promising results, our analysis identified several challenges, including variability in performance across datasets and the need for careful prompt engineering. Furthermore, the ethical guards imposed by many LLM providers hamper the ability to accurately evaluate their performance, due to tendency to not respond to potentially sensitive queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Dany Alfikri, Rafael Kaliski</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become integral to our everyday lives. Computer vision has advanced to the point where it can play the safety critical role of detecting pedestrians at road intersections in intelligent transportation systems and alert vehicular traffic as to potential collisions. Centralized computing analyzes camera feeds and generates alerts for nearby vehicles. However, real-time applications face challenges such as latency, limited data transfer speeds, and the risk of life loss. Edge servers offer a potential solution for real-time applications, providing localized computing and storage resources and lower response times. Unfortunately, edge servers have limited processing power. Lightweight deep learning (DL) techniques enable edge servers to utilize compressed deep neural network (DNN) models.
  The research explores implementing a lightweight DL model on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) edge devices. An optimized You Only Look Once (YOLO) based DL model is deployed for real-time pedestrian detection, with detection events transmitted to the edge server using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The simulation results demonstrate that the optimized YOLO model can achieve real-time pedestrian detection, with a fast inference speed of 147 milliseconds, a frame rate of 2.3 frames per second, and an accuracy of 78%, representing significant improvements over baseline models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of education, the integration of,technology has led to a transformative era, reshaping traditional,learning paradigms. Central to this evolution is the automation,of grading processes, particularly within the STEM domain encompassing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.,While efforts to automate grading have been made in subjects,like Literature, the multifaceted nature of STEM assessments,presents unique challenges, ranging from quantitative analysis,to the interpretation of handwritten diagrams.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuxian Huang, Qi Zhang, Shaopeng Zhai, Jie Wang, Tianyi Zhang, Haoran Zhang, Ming Zhou, Yu Liu, Yu Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning has become an important research area. For intelligent agents, the state is a crucial modality to convey precise information alongside common modalities like images, videos, and language. This becomes especially clear with the broad adoption of reinforcement learning and multimodal large language models. Nevertheless, the representation of state modality still lags in development. To this end, we propose a High-Fidelity Contrastive Language-State Pre-training (CLSP) method, which can accurately encode state information into general representations for both reinforcement learning and multimodal large language models. Specifically, we first design a pre-training task based on the classification to train an encoder with coarse-grained information. Next, we construct data pairs of states and language descriptions, utilizing the pre-trained encoder to initialize the CLSP encoder. Then, we deploy contrastive learning to train the CLSP encoder to effectively represent precise state information. Additionally, we enhance the representation of numerical information using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) method for high-fidelity mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior precision and generalization capabilities of our representation, achieving outstanding results in text-state retrieval, reinforcement learning navigation tasks, and multimodal large language model understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Asthma rates have risen globally, driven by environmental and lifestyle factors. Access to immediate medical care is limited, particularly in developing countries, necessitating automated support systems. Large Language Models like ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Gemini have advanced natural language processing in general and question answering in particular, however, they are prone to producing factually incorrect responses (i.e. hallucinations). Retrieval-augmented generation systems, integrating curated documents, can improve large language models' performance and reduce the incidence of hallucination. We introduce AsthmaBot, a multi-lingual, multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation system for asthma support. Evaluation of an asthma-related frequently asked questions dataset shows AsthmaBot's efficacy. AsthmaBot has an added interactive and intuitive interface that integrates different data modalities (text, images, videos) to make it accessible to the larger public. AsthmaBot is available online via \url{asthmabot.datanets.org}.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence algorithms has expanded their application to several fields such as the biomedical domain. Artificial intelligence systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs), can be particularly advantageous in drug discovery, which is a very long and expensive process. However, LLMs by themselves lack in-depth knowledge about specific domains and can generate factually incorrect information. Moreover, they are not able to perform more complex actions that imply the usage of external tools. Our work is focused on these two issues. Firstly, we show how the implementation of an advanced RAG system can help the LLM to generate more accurate answers to drug-discovery-related questions. The results show that the answers generated by the LLM with the RAG system surpass in quality the answers produced by the model without RAG. Secondly, we show how to create an automatic target dossier using LLMs and incorporating them with external tools that they can use to execute more intricate tasks to gather data such as accessing databases and executing code. The result is a production-ready target dossier containing the acquired information summarized into a PDF and a PowerPoint presentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In online education, innovative tools are crucial for enhancing learning outcomes. SAM (Study with AI Mentor) is an advanced platform that integrates educational videos with a context-aware chat interface powered by large language models. SAM encourages students to ask questions and explore unclear concepts in real-time, offering personalized, context-specific assistance, including explanations of formulas, slides, and images. In a crowdsourced user study involving 140 participants, SAM was evaluated through pre- and post-knowledge tests, comparing a group using SAM with a control group. The results demonstrated that SAM users achieved greater knowledge gains, with a 96.8% answer accuracy. Participants also provided positive feedback on SAM's usability and effectiveness. SAM's proactive approach to learning not only enhances learning outcomes but also empowers students to take full ownership of their educational experience, representing a promising future direction for online learning tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moucheng Xu, Evangelos Chatzaroulas, Luc McCutcheon, Abdul Ahad, Hamzah Azeem, Janusz Marecki, Ammar Anwar</p>
<p>Abstract: A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines a low-level, step-by-step written guide for a business software workflow based on a video demonstration. SOPs are a crucial step toward automating end-to-end software workflows. Manually creating SOPs can be time-consuming. Recent advancements in large video-language models offer the potential for automating SOP generation by analyzing recordings of human demonstrations. However, current large video-language models face challenges with zero-shot SOP generation. We explore in-context learning with video-language models for SOP generation. We report that in-context learning sometimes helps video-language models at SOP generation. We then propose an in-context ensemble learning to further enhance the capabilities of the models in SOP generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik Drexler, Simon St{\aa}hlberg, Blai Bonet, Hector Geffner</p>
<p>Abstract: State symmetries play an important role in planning and generalized planning. In the first case, state symmetries can be used to reduce the size of the search; in the second, to reduce the size of the training set. In the case of general planning, however, it is also critical to distinguish non-symmetric states, i.e., states that represent non-isomorphic relational structures. However, while the language of first-order logic distinguishes non-symmetric states, the languages and architectures used to represent and learn general policies do not. In particular, recent approaches for learning general policies use state features derived from description logics or learned via graph neural networks (GNNs) that are known to be limited by the expressive power of C_2, first-order logic with two variables and counting. In this work, we address the problem of detecting symmetries in planning and generalized planning and use the results to assess the expressive requirements for learning general policies over various planning domains. For this, we map planning states to plain graphs, run off-the-shelf algorithms to determine whether two states are isomorphic with respect to the goal, and run coloring algorithms to determine if C_2 features computed logically or via GNNs distinguish non-isomorphic states. Symmetry detection results in more effective learning, while the failure to detect non-symmetries prevents general policies from being learned at all in certain domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are generating much controversy in society, often without scientific basis. As occurred the development of other emerging technologies, such as the introduction of electricity in the early 20th century, AI causes both fascination and fear. Following the advice of the philosopher R.W. Emerson's: advice the knowledge is the antidote to fear; this paper seeks to contribute to the dissemination of knowledge about AI. To this end, it reflects on the following questions: the origins of AI, its possible future evolution, its ability to show feelings, the associated threats and dangers, and the concept of AI singularity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukai Huang, Nir Lipovetzky, Trevor Cohn</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving natural language-described planning tasks, but their direct use often leads to inconsistent reasoning and hallucination. While hybrid LLM-symbolic planning pipelines have emerged as a more robust alternative, they typically require extensive expert intervention to refine and validate generated action schemas. It not only limits scalability but also introduces a potential for biased interpretation, as a single expert's interpretation of ambiguous natural language descriptions might not align with the user's actual intent. To address this, we propose a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to generate multiple candidates, accounting for the diverse possible interpretations of natural language descriptions. We further introduce a semantic validation and ranking module that automatically filter and rank the generated schemas and plans without expert-in-the-loop. The experiments showed our pipeline maintains superiority in planning over the direct LLM planning approach. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated end-to-end LLM-symbolic planner that requires no expert intervention, opening up the possibility for a broader audience to engage with AI planning with less prerequisite of domain expertise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongnan Ma, Kevin McAreavey, Weiru Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting, while vital in various applications, often employs complex models that are difficult for humans to understand. Effective explainable AI techniques are crucial to bridging the gap between model predictions and user understanding. This paper presents a framework - TSFeatLIME, extending TSLIME, tailored specifically for explaining univariate time series forecasting. TSFeatLIME integrates an auxiliary feature into the surrogate model and considers the pairwise Euclidean distances between the queried time series and the generated samples to improve the fidelity of the surrogate models. However, the usefulness of such explanations for human beings remains an open question. We address this by conducting a user study with 160 participants through two interactive interfaces, aiming to measure how individuals from different backgrounds can simulate or predict model output changes in the treatment group and control group. Our results show that the surrogate model under the TSFeatLIME framework is able to better simulate the behaviour of the black-box considering distance, without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, the user study suggests that the explanations were significantly more effective for participants without a computer science background.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has surpassed any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led to both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. In the sequel, we shall explore the interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We slightly delve into interesting aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. Additionally, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation AI development. We finalize this evolving document with a few thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Cachet, Christopher R. Dance, Olivier Sigaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have tremendous potential for grounding language, and thus enabling language-conditioned agents (LCAs) to perform diverse tasks specified with text. This has motivated the study of LCAs based on reinforcement learning (RL) with rewards given by rendering images of an environment and evaluating those images with VLMs. If single-task RL is employed, such approaches are limited by the cost and time required to train a policy for each new task. Multi-task RL (MTRL) is a natural alternative, but requires a carefully designed corpus of training tasks and does not always generalize reliably to new tasks. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel decomposition of the problem of building an LCA: first find an environment configuration that has a high VLM score for text describing a task; then use a (pretrained) goal-conditioned policy to reach that configuration. We also explore several enhancements to the speed and quality of VLM-based LCAs, notably, the use of distilled models, and the evaluation of configurations from multiple viewpoints to resolve the ambiguities inherent in a single 2D view. We demonstrate our approach on the Humanoid environment, showing that it results in LCAs that outperform MTRL baselines in zero-shot generalization, without requiring any textual task descriptions or other forms of environment-specific annotation during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tommaso Carraro, Luciano Serafini, Fabio Aiolli</p>
<p>Abstract: Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) is a Neuro-Symbolic framework that effectively incorporates deep learning and logical reasoning. In particular, LTN allows defining a logical knowledge base and using it as the objective of a neural model. This makes learning by logical reasoning possible as the parameters of the model are optimized by minimizing a loss function composed of a set of logical formulas expressing facts about the learning task. The framework learns via gradient-descent optimization. Fuzzy logic, a relaxation of classical logic permitting continuous truth values in the interval [0,1], makes this learning possible. Specifically, the training of an LTN consists of three steps. Firstly, (1) the training data is used to ground the formulas. Then, (2) the formulas are evaluated, and the loss function is computed. Lastly, (3) the gradients are back-propagated through the logical computational graph, and the weights of the neural model are changed so the knowledge base is maximally satisfied. LTNtorch is the fully documented and tested PyTorch implementation of Logic Tensor Networks. This paper presents the formalization of LTN and how LTNtorch implements it. Moreover, it provides a basic binary classification example.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Axel H{\o}jmark, Govind Pimpale, Arjun Panickssery, Marius Hobbhahn, J\'er\'emy Scheurer</p>
<p>Abstract: To mitigate risks from AI systems, we need to assess their capabilities accurately. This is especially difficult in cases where capabilities are only rarely displayed. Phuong et al. propose two methods that aim to obtain better estimates of the probability of an AI agent successfully completing a given task. The milestone method decomposes tasks into subtasks, aiming to improve overall success rate estimation, while the expert best-of-N method leverages human guidance as a proxy for the model's independent performance.
  Our analysis of these methods as Monte Carlo estimators reveals that while both effectively reduce variance compared to naive Monte Carlo sampling, they also introduce bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the milestone method underestimates true solve rates for many real-world tasks due to its constraining assumptions. The expert best-of-N method exhibits even more severe underestimation across all tasks, attributed to an inherently flawed re-weighting factor. To enhance the accuracy of capability estimates of AI agents on difficult tasks, we suggest future work should leverage the rich literature on Monte Carlo Estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jue Hou, Anisia Katinskaia, Anh-Duc Vu, Roman Yangarber</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessment of proficiency of the learner is an essential part of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). We use Item Response Theory (IRT) in computer-aided language learning for assessment of student ability in two contexts: in test sessions, and in exercises during practice sessions. Exhaustive testing across a wide range of skills can provide a detailed picture of proficiency, but may be undesirable for a number of reasons. Therefore, we first aim to replace exhaustive tests with efficient but accurate adaptive tests. We use learner data collected from exhaustive tests under imperfect conditions, to train an IRT model to guide adaptive tests. Simulations and experiments with real learner data confirm that this approach is efficient and accurate. Second, we explore whether we can accurately estimate learner ability directly from the context of practice with exercises, without testing. We transform learner data collected from exercise sessions into a form that can be used for IRT modeling. This is done by linking the exercises to {\em linguistic constructs}; the constructs are then treated as "items" within IRT. We present results from large-scale studies with thousands of learners. Using teacher assessments of student ability as "ground truth," we compare the estimates obtained from tests vs. those from exercises. The experiments confirm that the IRT models can produce accurate ability estimation based on exercises.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although language model (LM) agents are demonstrating growing potential in many domains, their success in cybersecurity has been limited due to simplistic design and the lack of fundamental features for this domain. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. EnIGMA introduces new Agent-Computer Interfaces (ACIs) to improve the success rate on CTF challenges. We establish the novel Interactive Agent Tool concept, which enables LM agents to run interactive command-line utilities essential for these challenges. Empirical analysis of EnIGMA on over 350 CTF challenges from three different benchmarks indicates that providing a robust set of new tools with demonstration of their usage helps the LM solve complex problems and achieves state-of-the-art results on the NYU CTF and Intercode-CTF benchmarks. Finally, we discuss insights on ACI design and agent behavior on cybersecurity tasks that highlight the need to adapt real-world tools for LM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Bai, Zhuofan Chen, Zhenzi Li, Hanhua Hong, Jianfei Zhang, Chen Li, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Text ranking has witnessed significant advancements, attributed to the utilization of dual-encoder enhanced by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Given the proliferation of available PLMs, selecting the most effective one for a given dataset has become a non-trivial challenge. As a promising alternative to human intuition and brute-force fine-tuning, Transferability Estimation (TE) has emerged as an effective approach to model selection. However, current TE methods are primarily designed for classification tasks, and their estimated transferability may not align well with the objectives of text ranking. To address this challenge, we propose to compute the expected rank as transferability, explicitly reflecting the model's ranking capability. Furthermore, to mitigate anisotropy and incorporate training dynamics, we adaptively scale isotropic sentence embeddings to yield an accurate expected rank score. Our resulting method, Adaptive Ranking Transferability (AiRTran), can effectively capture subtle differences between models. On challenging model selection scenarios across various text ranking datasets, it demonstrates significant improvements over previous classification-oriented TE methods, human intuition, and ChatGPT with minor time consumption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online education platforms have significantly transformed the dissemination of educational resources by providing a dynamic and digital infrastructure. With the further enhancement of this transformation, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has elevated the intelligence levels of these platforms. However, current academic benchmarks provide limited guidance for real-world industry scenarios. This limitation arises because educational applications require more than mere test question responses. To bridge this gap, we introduce CJEval, a benchmark based on Chinese Junior High School Exam Evaluations. CJEval consists of 26,136 samples across four application-level educational tasks covering ten subjects. These samples include not only questions and answers but also detailed annotations such as question types, difficulty levels, knowledge concepts, and answer explanations. By utilizing this benchmark, we assessed LLMs' potential applications and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their performance by fine-tuning on various educational tasks. Extensive experiments and discussions have highlighted the opportunities and challenges of applying LLMs in the field of education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Feldstein, Dominic Phillips, Efthymia Tsamoura</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic logical models are a core component of neurosymbolic AI and are important models in their own right for tasks that require high explainability. Unlike neural networks, logical models are often handcrafted using domain expertise, making their development costly and prone to errors. While there are algorithms that learn logical models from data, they are generally prohibitively expensive, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce precision and recall for logical rules and define their composition as rule utility -- a cost-effective measure to evaluate the predictive power of logical models. Further, we introduce SPECTRUM, a scalable framework for learning logical models from relational data. Its scalability derives from a linear-time algorithm that mines recurrent structures in the data along with a second algorithm that, using the cheap utility measure, efficiently ranks rules built from these structures. Moreover, we derive theoretical guarantees on the utility of the learnt logical model. As a result, SPECTRUM learns more accurate logical models orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have showcased the capabilities of Large Language Models like GPT4 and Llama2 in tasks such as summarization, translation, and content review. However, their widespread use raises concerns, particularly around the potential for LLMs to spread persuasive, humanlike misinformation at scale, which could significantly influence public opinion. This study examines these risks, focusing on LLMs ability to propagate misinformation as factual. To investigate this, we built the LLM Echo Chamber, a controlled digital environment simulating social media chatrooms, where misinformation often spreads. Echo chambers, where individuals only interact with like minded people, further entrench beliefs. By studying malicious bots spreading misinformation in this environment, we can better understand this phenomenon. We reviewed current LLMs, explored misinformation risks, and applied sota finetuning techniques. Using Microsoft phi2 model, finetuned with our custom dataset, we generated harmful content to create the Echo Chamber. This setup, evaluated by GPT4 for persuasiveness and harmfulness, sheds light on the ethical concerns surrounding LLMs and emphasizes the need for stronger safeguards against misinformation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous to create intelligent virtual assistants that assist users in interacting with a system, as exemplified in marketing. Although LLMs have been discussed in Modeling & Simulation (M&S), the community has focused on generating code or explaining results. We examine the possibility of using LLMs to broaden access to simulations, by enabling non-simulation end-users to ask what-if questions in everyday language. Specifically, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in designing such an end-to-end system, divided into three broad phases. First, assuming the general case in which several simulation models are available, textual queries are mapped to the most relevant model. Second, if a mapping cannot be found, the query can be automatically reformulated and clarifying questions can be generated. Finally, simulation results are produced and contextualized for decision-making. Our vision for such system articulates long-term research opportunities spanning M&S, LLMs, information retrieval, and ethics.</p>

Our contributions include the development of a custom Vector Low Rank Adaptation model (LoRA), enabling seamless adaptation to various artistic styles, and integrating a pair-wise fine-tuning approach to enhance stroke quality and stylistic accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to produce high-quality, personalized portraits within two minutes, highlighting its potential as a new paradigm in robotic creativity.

<p>Abstract: We investigate whether LLMs display a well-known human cognitive bias, the attraction effect, in hiring decisions. The attraction effect occurs when the presence of an inferior candidate makes a superior candidate more appealing, increasing the likelihood of the superior candidate being chosen over a non-dominated competitor. Our study finds consistent and significant evidence of the attraction effect in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 when they assume the role of a recruiter. Irrelevant attributes of the decoy, such as its gender, further amplify the observed bias. GPT-4 exhibits greater bias variation than GPT-3.5. Our findings remain robust even when warnings against the decoy effect are included and the recruiter role definition is varied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users filter through vast amounts of information. However, traditional recommendation algorithms often overlook the integration and utilization of multi-source information, limiting system performance. Therefore, this study proposes a novel recommendation model, Knowledge Graph Attention-assisted Network (KGAT-AX). We first incorporate the knowledge graph into the recommendation model, introducing an attention mechanism to explore higher order connectivity more explicitly. By using multilayer interactive information propagation, the model aggregates information to enhance its generalization ability. Furthermore, we integrate auxiliary information into entities through holographic embeddings, aggregating the information of adjacent entities for each entity by learning their inferential relationships. This allows for better utilization of auxiliary information associated with entities. We conducted experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the KGAT-AX model. Through experimental analysis, we observed the effectiveness and potential of KGAT-AX compared to other baseline models on public datasets. KGAT-AX demonstrates better knowledge information capture and relationship learning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon J. McMahan, Zhenghao Peng, Bolei Zhou, Jonathan C. Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has unearthed the potential to assist humans in controlling advanced technologies. Shared autonomy (SA) facilitates control by combining inputs from a human pilot and an AI copilot. In prior SA studies, the copilot is constantly active in determining the action played at each time step. This limits human autonomy and may have deleterious effects on performance. In general, the amount of helpful copilot assistance can vary greatly depending on the task dynamics. We therefore hypothesize that human autonomy and SA performance improve through dynamic and selective copilot intervention. To address this, we develop a goal-agnostic intervention assistance (IA) that dynamically shares control by having the copilot intervene only when the expected value of the copilot's action exceeds that of the human's action across all possible goals. We implement IA with a diffusion copilot (termed IDA) trained on expert demonstrations with goal masking. We prove a lower bound on the performance of IA that depends on pilot and copilot performance. Experiments with simulated human pilots show that IDA achieves higher performance than pilot-only and traditional SA control in variants of the Reacher environment and Lunar Lander. We then demonstrate that IDA achieves better control in Lunar Lander with human-in-the-loop experiments. Human participants report greater autonomy with IDA and prefer IDA over pilot-only and traditional SA control. We attribute the success of IDA to preserving human autonomy while simultaneously offering assistance to prevent the human pilot from entering universally bad states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micah Adler, Nir Shavit</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in the understanding of neural networks suggest that superposition, the ability of a single neuron to represent multiple features simultaneously, is a key mechanism underlying the computational efficiency of large-scale networks. This paper explores the theoretical foundations of computing in superposition, focusing on explicit, provably correct algorithms and their efficiency.
  We present the first lower bounds showing that for a broad class of problems, including permutations and pairwise logical operations, a neural network computing in superposition requires at least $\Omega(m' \log m')$ parameters and $\Omega(\sqrt{m' \log m'})$ neurons, where $m'$ is the number of output features being computed. This implies that any ``lottery ticket'' sparse sub-network must have at least $\Omega(m' \log m')$ parameters no matter what the initial dense network size. Conversely, we show a nearly tight upper bound: logical operations like pairwise AND can be computed using $O(\sqrt{m'} \log m')$ neurons and $O(m' \log^2 m')$ parameters. There is thus an exponential gap between computing in superposition, the subject of this work, and representing features in superposition, which can require as little as $O(\log m'$) neurons based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.
  Our hope is that our results open a path for using complexity theoretic techniques in neural network interpretability research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberta Rocca, Giada Pistilli, Kritika Maheshwari, Riccardo Fusaroli</p>
<p>Abstract: As mental health care systems worldwide struggle to meet demand, there is increasing focus on using language models to infer neuropsychiatric conditions or psychopathological traits from language production. Yet, so far, this research has only delivered solutions with limited clinical applicability, due to insufficient consideration of ethical questions crucial to ensuring the synergy between possible applications and model design. To accelerate progress towards clinically applicable models, our paper charts the ethical landscape of research on language-based inference of psychopathology and provides a practical tool for researchers to navigate it. We identify seven core ethical principles that should guide model development and deployment in this domain, translate them into ELLIPS, an ethical toolkit operationalizing these principles into questions that can guide researchers' choices with respect to data selection, architectures, evaluation, and model deployment, and provide a case study exemplifying its use. With this, we aim to facilitate the emergence of model technology with concrete potential for real-world applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Jung, Alex Butler, Joongheum Park, Yair Saperstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of Large language models (LLMs) to augment clinical decision support systems is a topic with rapidly growing interest, but current shortcomings such as hallucinations and lack of clear source citations make them unreliable for use in the clinical environment. This study evaluates Ask Avo, an LLM-derived software by AvoMD that incorporates a proprietary Language Model Augmented Retrieval (LMAR) system, in-built visual citation cues, and prompt engineering designed for interactions with physicians, against ChatGPT-4 in end-user experience for physicians in a simulated clinical scenario environment. Eight clinical questions derived from medical guideline documents in various specialties were prompted to both models by 62 study participants, with each response rated on trustworthiness, actionability, relevancy, comprehensiveness, and friendly format from 1 to 5. Ask Avo significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4 in all criteria: trustworthiness (4.52 vs. 3.34, p<0.001), actionability (4.41 vs. 3.19, p<0.001), relevancy (4.55 vs. 3.49, p<0.001), comprehensiveness (4.50 vs. 3.37, p<0.001), and friendly format (4.52 vs. 3.60, p<0.001). Our findings suggest that specialized LLMs designed with the needs of clinicians in mind can offer substantial improvements in user experience over general-purpose LLMs. Ask Avo's evidence-based approach tailored to clinician needs shows promise in the adoption of LLM-augmented clinical decision support software.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anik Roy, Serene Banerjee, Jishnu Sadasivan, Arnab Sarkar, Soumyajit Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: The next-generation wireless network, 6G and beyond, envisions to integrate communication and sensing to overcome interference, improve spectrum efficiency, and reduce hardware and power consumption. Massive Multiple-Input Multiple Output (mMIMO)-based Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) systems realize this integration for 6G applications such as autonomous driving, as it requires accurate environmental sensing and time-critical communication with neighboring vehicles. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for mMIMO antenna beamforming in the existing literature. However, the huge search space for actions associated with antenna beamforming causes the learning process for the RL agent to be inefficient due to high beam training overhead. The learning process does not consider the causal relationship between action space and the reward, and gives all actions equal importance. In this work, we explore a causally-aware RL agent which can intervene and discover causal relationships for mMIMO-based JCAS environments, during the training phase. We use a state dependent action dimension selection strategy to realize causal discovery for RL-based JCAS. Evaluation of the causally-aware RL framework in different JCAS scenarios shows the benefit of our proposed framework over baseline methods in terms of the beamforming gain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evangelia Kyrimi, Scott McLachlan, Jared M Wohlgemut, Zane B Perkins, David A. Lagnado, William Marsh, the ExAIDSS Expert Group</p>
<p>Abstract: Proposals of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions based on increasingly complex and accurate predictive models are becoming ubiquitous across many disciplines. As the complexity of these models grows, transparency and users' understanding often diminish. This suggests that accurate prediction alone is insufficient for making an AI-based solution truly useful. In the development of healthcare systems, this introduces new issues related to accountability and safety. Understanding how and why an AI system makes a recommendation may require complex explanations of its inner workings and reasoning processes. Although research on explainable AI (XAI) has significantly increased in recent years and there is high demand for XAI in medicine, defining what constitutes a good explanation remains ad hoc, and providing adequate explanations continues to be challenging. To fully realize the potential of AI, it is critical to address two fundamental questions about explanations for safety-critical AI applications, such as health-AI: (1) What is an explanation in health-AI? and (2) What are the attributes of a good explanation in health-AI? In this study, we examined published literature and gathered expert opinions through a two-round Delphi study. The research outputs include (1) a definition of what constitutes an explanation in health-AI and (2) a comprehensive list of attributes that characterize a good explanation in health-AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongqi Cai, Shangguang Wang, Chen Peng, Zeling Zhang, Mengwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human memory is inherently prone to forgetting. To address this, multimodal embedding models have been introduced, which transform diverse real-world data into a unified embedding space. These embeddings can be retrieved efficiently, aiding mobile users in recalling past information. However, as model complexity grows, so do its resource demands, leading to reduced throughput and heavy computational requirements that limit mobile device implementation. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a novel on-device multimodal embedding system optimized for resource-limited mobile environments. RECALL achieves high-throughput, accurate retrieval by generating coarse-grained embeddings and leveraging query-based filtering for refined retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that RECALL delivers high-quality embeddings with superior throughput, all while operating unobtrusively with minimal memory and energy consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Its main idea lies in dividing the input sequence into blocks, where each block calculates its key-value (KV) states independently except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to pre-compute the KV states for all passages and cache them in memory.
  The implementation involves block segmentation, positional encoding calculation, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block Attention model can achieve performance comparable to (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even better (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral) than self-attention models. Notably, Block-Attention reduces the TTFT to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared with the self-attention model, the time consumption is reduced by 98.7\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a variant of chain of thought (CoT) prompting called Program Trace Prompting that makes explanations more observable while preserving the power, generality and flexibility of CoT. In our approach, few-shot CoT demonstrations are wrapped in a formal syntax based on Python, and each prompt: identifies and names steps; defines the input/output behavior of steps; and replaces CoT explanations of in-context examples with chains of these formalized steps on the same examples. Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we enable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify "non-local errors" (which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in the demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present methods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect reward models. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms traditional RLHF across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be effective in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment with RLHF.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their adoption across a wide range of tasks, ranging from code generation to machine translation and sentiment analysis, etc. Red teaming/Safety alignment efforts show that fine-tuning models on benign (non-harmful) data could compromise safety. However, it remains unclear to what extent this phenomenon is influenced by different variables, including fine-tuning task, model calibrations, etc. This paper explores the task-wise safety degradation due to fine-tuning on downstream tasks such as summarization, code generation, translation, and classification across various calibration. Our results reveal that: 1) Fine-tuning LLMs for code generation and translation leads to the highest degradation in safety guardrails. 2) LLMs generally have weaker guardrails for translation and classification, with 73-92% of harmful prompts answered, across baseline and other calibrations, falling into one of two concern categories. 3) Current solutions, including guards and safety tuning datasets, lack cross-task robustness. To address these issues, we developed a new multitask safety dataset effectively reducing attack success rates across a range of tasks without compromising the model's overall helpfulness. Our work underscores the need for generalized alignment measures to ensure safer and more robust models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitin Aravind Birur, Tanay Baswa, Divyanshu Kumar, Jatan Loya, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but often produce inaccurate responses, as they rely solely on their embedded knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating an external information retrieval system, supplying additional context along with the query to mitigate inaccuracies for a particular context. However, accuracy issues still remain, as the model may rely on irrelevant documents or extrapolate incorrectly from its training knowledge. To assess and improve the performance of both the retrieval system and the LLM in a RAG framework, we propose \textbf{VERA} (\textbf{V}alidation and \textbf{E}nhancement for \textbf{R}etrieval \textbf{A}ugmented systems), a system designed to: 1) Evaluate and enhance the retrieved context before response generation, and 2) Evaluate and refine the LLM-generated response to ensure precision and minimize errors. VERA employs an evaluator-cum-enhancer LLM that first checks if external retrieval is necessary, evaluates the relevance and redundancy of the retrieved context, and refines it to eliminate non-essential information. Post-response generation, VERA splits the response into atomic statements, assesses their relevance to the query, and ensures adherence to the context. Our experiments demonstrate VERA's remarkable efficacy not only in improving the performance of smaller open-source models, but also larger state-of-the art models. These enhancements underscore VERA's potential to produce accurate and relevant responses, advancing the state-of-the-art in retrieval-augmented language modeling. VERA's robust methodology, combining multiple evaluation and refinement steps, effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves retrieval and response processes, making it a valuable tool for applications demanding high accuracy and reliability in information generation. .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitra Bakhshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating the Forward Forward algorithm into neural network training represents a transformative shift from traditional methods, introducing a dual forward mechanism that streamlines the learning process by bypassing the complexities of derivative propagation. This method is noted for its simplicity and efficiency and involves executing two forward passes the first with actual data to promote positive reinforcement, and the second with synthetically generated negative data to enable discriminative learning. Our experiments confirm that the Forward Forward algorithm is not merely an experimental novelty but a viable training strategy that competes robustly with conventional multi layer perceptron (MLP) architectures. To overcome the limitations inherent in traditional saliency techniques, which predominantly rely on gradient based methods, we developed a bespoke saliency algorithm specifically tailored for the Forward Forward framework. This innovative algorithm enhances the intuitive understanding of feature importance and network decision-making, providing clear visualizations of the data features most influential in model predictions. By leveraging this specialized saliency method, we gain deeper insights into the internal workings of the model, significantly enhancing our interpretative capabilities beyond those offered by standard approaches. Our evaluations, utilizing the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, demonstrate that our method performs comparably to traditional MLP-based models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP), there has been a surge in research focused on developing foundational models for time series forecasting. One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical coding is essential for standardizing clinical data and communication but is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods struggle with automating coding due to the large label space, lengthy text inputs, and the absence of supporting evidence annotations that justify code selection. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to these challenges. In this work, we introduce MedCodER, a Generative AI framework for automatic medical coding that leverages extraction, retrieval, and re-ranking techniques as core components. MedCodER achieves a micro-F1 score of 0.60 on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code prediction, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present a new dataset containing medical records annotated with disease diagnoses, ICD codes, and supporting evidence texts (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13308316). Ablation tests confirm that MedCodER's performance depends on the integration of each of its aforementioned components, as performance declines when these components are evaluated in isolation.</p>

Using N-gram language models, we accessed the impact of tokenizer choice on model performance and quantified the information loss of unknown tokens. We introduce two new tokenizers, <i>smirk</i> and <i>smirk-gpe</i>, which can represent the entirety of the OpenSMILES specification while avoiding the pitfalls of existing tokenizers. Our work highlights the importance of open-vocabulary modeling for molecular foundation models and the need for chemically diverse benchmarks for cheminformatics.</p>

Consequently, the exploration of cost-effective and efficient fine-tuning methods has become increasingly important. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable training results by freezing the original weights and training only low-rank matrices, establishing itself as the predominant fine-tuning method for LLMs. In pursuit of performance closer to full-parameter training, a series of LoRA variants have emerged, such as LoRA+, PISSA, Olora, and LoRA-GA. However, these methods also make the fine-tuning initialization process more complex, and it remains challenging to surpass the performance ceiling of full fine-tuning. To address these issues, this paper introduces an innovative method called Bone (Block Affine), which not only reduces memory overhead but also emphasizes the internal connections between weights, leading to faster convergence and better data fitting. Experimental comparisons across two different LLM architectures (LLaMA2, RWKV6) and various parameter scales demonstrate that the Bone structure can achieve rapid convergence and superior data fitting without the need for complex initialization. For example, when fine-tuning LLaMA2-7B on the MetaMathQA dataset and validating on GSM8k and math benchmarks, Bone achieved fine-tuning scores of 49.36 and 8.8, respectively, outperforming PISSA by 5.84\% and 1.96\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of hardware accelerators has significantly advanced the capabilities of modern recommendation systems, enabling the exploration of complex ranking paradigms previously deemed impractical. However, the GPU-based computational costs present substantial challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate our development of an efficiency-driven approach to explore these paradigms, moving beyond traditional reliance on native PyTorch modules. We address the specific challenges posed by ranking models' dependence on categorical features, which vary in length and complicate GPU utilization. We introduce Jagged Feature Interaction Kernels, a novel method designed to extract fine-grained insights from long categorical features through efficient handling of dynamically sized tensors. We further enhance the performance of attention mechanisms by integrating Jagged tensors with Flash Attention. Our novel Jagged Flash Attention achieves up to 9x speedup and 22x memory reduction compared to dense attention. Notably, it also outperforms dense flash attention, with up to 3x speedup and 53% more memory efficiency. In production models, we observe 10% QPS improvement and 18% memory savings, enabling us to scale our recommendation systems with longer features and more complex architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suryansh Vidya, Kush Gupta, Amir Aly, Andy Wills, Emmanuel Ifeachor, Rohit Shankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis and intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life of autistic individuals. However, diagnostics methods for ASD rely on assessments based on clinical presentation that are prone to bias and can be challenging to arrive at an early diagnosis. There is a need for objective biomarkers of ASD which can help improve diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning (DL) has achieved outstanding performance in diagnosing diseases and conditions from medical imaging data. Extensive research has been conducted on creating models that classify ASD using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, existing models lack interpretability. This research aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of ASD diagnosis by creating a DL model that can not only accurately classify ASD but also provide explainable insights into its working. The dataset used is a preprocessed version of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) with 884 samples. Our findings show a model that can accurately classify ASD and highlight critical brain regions differing between ASD and typical controls, with potential implications for early diagnosis and understanding of the neural basis of ASD. These findings are validated by studies in the literature that use different datasets and modalities, confirming that the model actually learned characteristics of ASD and not just the dataset. This study advances the field of explainable AI in medical imaging by providing a robust and interpretable model, thereby contributing to a future with objective and reliable ASD diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxun Xu, Hejia Geng, Yuxuan Yin, Peng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) are current high-performance models of choice for various vision applications. Recent developments have given rise to biologically inspired spiking transformers that thrive in ultra-low power operations on neuromorphic hardware, however, without fully unlocking the potential of spiking neural networks. We introduce DS2TA, a Denoising Spiking transformer with attenuated SpatioTemporal Attention, designed specifically for vision applications. DS2TA introduces a new spiking attenuated spatiotemporal attention mechanism that considers input firing correlations occurring in both time and space, thereby fully harnessing the computational power of spiking neurons at the core of the transformer architecture. Importantly, DS2TA facilitates parameter-efficient spatiotemporal attention computation without introducing extra weights. DS2TA employs efficient hashmap-based nonlinear spiking attention denoisers to enhance the robustness and expressive power of spiking attention maps. DS2TA demonstrates state-of-the-art performances on several widely adopted static image and dynamic neuromorphic datasets. Operated over 4 time steps, DS2TA achieves 94.92% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 77.47% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR100, as well as 79.1% and 94.44% on CIFAR10-DVS and DVS-Gesture using 10 time steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuo Chen, Ning Wu, Jianhui Chang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has yielded encouraging results in mathematical reasoning. However, these approaches face constraints in problem diversity, potentially restricting them to in-domain/distribution data generation. To this end, we propose ControlMath, an iterative method involving an equation-generator module and two LLM-based agents. The module creates diverse equations, which the Problem-Crafter agent then transforms into math word problems. The Reverse-Agent filters and selects high-quality data, adhering to the "less is more" principle, achieving better results with fewer data points. This approach enables the generation of diverse math problems, not limited to specific domains or distributions. As a result, we collect ControlMathQA, which involves 190k math word problems. Extensive results prove that combining our dataset with in-domain datasets like GSM8K can help improve the model's mathematical ability to generalize, leading to improved performances both within and beyond specific domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisa Castagnari (HeKA), Lillian Muyama (HeKA), Adrien Coulet (HeKA)</p>
<p>Abstract: In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models. Experimental results indicate that LLMs hold huge potential in clinical pathway discovery from patient data, with GPT-4 exhibiting the best performance in all conducted experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) today may not necessarily provide culturally appropriate and relevant responses to its Filipino users. We introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that text-to-image (T2I) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially with noun perturbations in text prompts. In this study, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on different POS tags within text prompts on the images generated by T2I models. We create a high-quality dataset for realistic POS tag token swapping and perform gradient-based attacks to find adversarial suffixes that mislead T2I models into generating images with altered tokens. Our empirical results show that the attack success rate (ASR) varies significantly among different POS tag categories, with nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives being the easiest to attack. We explore the mechanism behind the steering effect of adversarial suffixes, finding that the number of critical tokens and content fusion vary among POS tags, while features like suffix transferability are consistent across categories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoqi Wang, Chunjie Yang, Siwei Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks (NN) are extensively studied in cutting-edge soft sensor models due to their feature extraction and function approximation capabilities. Current research into network-based methods primarily focuses on models' offline accuracy. Notably, in industrial soft sensor context, online optimizing stability and interpretability are prioritized, followed by accuracy. This requires a clearer understanding of network's training process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel NN named the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) which has solid mathematical basis and presents superior training stability. AOPU truncates the gradient backpropagation at dual parameters, optimizes the trackable parameters updates, and enhances the robustness of training. We further prove that AOPU attains minimum variance estimation (MVE) in NN, wherein the truncated gradient approximates the natural gradient (NG). Empirical results on two chemical process datasets clearly show that AOPU outperforms other models in achieving stable convergence, marking a significant advancement in soft sensor field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilu Li, Guandao Yang, Qingqing Zhao, Xi Deng, Leonidas Guibas, Bharath Hariharan, Gordon Wetzstein</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a method to leverage arbitrary neural network architecture for control variates. Control variates are crucial in reducing the variance of Monte Carlo integration, but they hinge on finding a function that both correlates with the integrand and has a known analytical integral. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics to choose this function, which might not be expressive enough to correlate well with the integrand. Recent research alleviates this issue by modeling the integrands with a learnable parametric model, such as a neural network. However, the challenge remains in creating an expressive parametric model with a known analytical integral. This paper proposes a novel approach to construct learnable parametric control variates functions from arbitrary neural network architectures. Instead of using a network to approximate the integrand directly, we employ the network to approximate the anti-derivative of the integrand. This allows us to use automatic differentiation to create a function whose integration can be constructed by the antiderivative network. We apply our method to solve partial differential equations using the Walk-on-sphere algorithm. Our results indicate that this approach is unbiased and uses various network architectures to achieve lower variance than other control variate methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Mao, Chengbin Hou, Tianyu Zhang, Xinyu Lin, Ke Tang, Hairong Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.</p>

<p>Abstract: As generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into production applications, new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities emerge and put a focus on adversarial threats in natural language and multi-modal systems. Red-teaming has gained importance in proactively identifying weaknesses in these systems, while blue-teaming works to protect against such adversarial attacks. Despite growing academic interest in adversarial risks for generative AI, there is limited guidance tailored for practitioners to assess and mitigate these challenges in real-world environments. To address this, our contributions include: (1) a practical examination of red- and blue-teaming strategies for securing generative AI, (2) identification of key challenges and open questions in defense development and evaluation, and (3) the Attack Atlas, an intuitive framework that brings a practical approach to analyzing single-turn input attacks, placing it at the forefront for practitioners. This work aims to bridge the gap between academic insights and practical security measures for the protection of generative AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mike Zhang, Kaixian Qu, Vaishakh Patil, Cesar Cadena, Marco Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as a tool for robots to generate task plans using common sense reasoning. For the LLM to generate actionable plans, scene context must be provided, often through a map. Recent works have shifted from explicit maps with fixed semantic classes to implicit open vocabulary maps based on queryable embeddings capable of representing any semantic class. However, embeddings cannot directly report the scene context as they are implicit, requiring further processing for LLM integration. To address this, we propose an explicit text-based map that can represent thousands of semantic classes while easily integrating with LLMs due to their text-based nature by building upon large-scale image recognition models. We study how entities in our map can be localized and show through evaluations that our text-based map localizations perform comparably to those from open vocabulary maps while using two to four orders of magnitude less memory. Real-robot experiments demonstrate the grounding of an LLM with the text-based map to solve user tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengrui Han, Peiyang Song, Haofei Yu, Jiaxuan You</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have led to the creation of highly capable large language models (LLMs) that can perform tasks in a human-like manner. However, LLMs exhibit only infant-level cognitive abilities in certain areas. One such area is the A-Not-B error, a phenomenon seen in infants where they repeat a previously rewarded behavior despite well-observed changed conditions. This highlights their lack of inhibitory control -- the ability to stop a habitual or impulsive response. In our work, we design a text-based multi-choice QA scenario similar to the A-Not-B experimental settings to systematically test the inhibitory control abilities of LLMs. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs (like Llama3-8b) perform consistently well with in-context learning (ICL) but make errors and show a significant drop of as many as 83.3% in reasoning tasks when the context changes trivially. This suggests that LLMs only have inhibitory control abilities on par with human infants in this regard, often failing to suppress the previously established response pattern during ICL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring robust performance on long-tail examples is an important problem for many real-world applications of machine learning, such as autonomous driving. This work focuses on the problem of identifying rare examples within a corpus of unlabeled data. We propose a simple and scalable data mining approach that leverages the knowledge contained within a large vision language model (VLM). Our approach utilizes a VLM to summarize the content of an image into a set of keywords, and we identify rare examples based on keyword frequency. We find that the VLM offers a distinct signal for identifying long-tail examples when compared to conventional methods based on model uncertainty. Therefore, we propose a simple and general approach for integrating signals from multiple mining algorithms. We evaluate the proposed method on two diverse tasks: 2D image classification, in which inter-class variation is the primary source of data diversity, and on 3D object detection, where intra-class variation is the main concern. Furthermore, through the detection task, we demonstrate that the knowledge extracted from 2D images is transferable to the 3D domain. Our experiments consistently show large improvements (between 10\% and 50\%) over the baseline techniques on several representative benchmarks: ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and the Waymo Open Dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate recurrence risk stratification is crucial for optimizing treatment plans for breast cancer patients. Current prognostic tools like Oncotype DX (ODX) offer valuable genomic insights for HR+/HER2- patients but are limited by cost and accessibility, particularly in underserved populations. In this study, we present Deep-BCR-Auto, a deep learning-based computational pathology approach that predicts breast cancer recurrence risk from routine H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Our methodology was validated on two independent cohorts: the TCGA-BRCA dataset and an in-house dataset from The Ohio State University (OSU). Deep-BCR-Auto demonstrated robust performance in stratifying patients into low- and high-recurrence risk categories. On the TCGA-BRCA dataset, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.827, significantly outperforming existing weakly supervised models (p=0.041). In the independent OSU dataset, Deep-BCR-Auto maintained strong generalizability, achieving an AUROC of 0.832, along with 82.0% accuracy, 85.0% specificity, and 67.7% sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of computational pathology as a cost-effective alternative for recurrence risk assessment, broadening access to personalized treatment strategies. This study underscores the clinical utility of integrating deep learning-based computational pathology into routine pathological assessment for breast cancer prognosis across diverse clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmal Roy, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Rexhina Blloshmi, Kevin Small</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with information retrieval capabilities (i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)) has proven beneficial for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, understanding users' contextual search intent when generating responses is an understudied topic for conversational question answering (QA). This conversational extension leads to additional concerns when compared to single-turn QA as it is more challenging for systems to comprehend conversational context and manage retrieved passages over multiple turns. In this work, we propose a method for enabling LLMs to decide when to retrieve in RAG settings given a conversational context. When retrieval is deemed necessary, the LLM then rewrites the conversation for passage retrieval and judges the relevance of returned passages before response generation. Operationally, we build on the single-turn SELF-RAG framework (Asai et al., 2023) and propose SELF-multi-RAG for conversational settings. SELF-multi-RAG demonstrates improved capabilities over single-turn variants with respect to retrieving relevant passages (by using summarized conversational context) and assessing the quality of generated responses. Experiments on three conversational QA datasets validate the enhanced response generation capabilities of SELF-multi-RAG, with improvements of ~13% measured by human annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Srijita Das, Matthew E. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent times, Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to many challenging tasks. However, in order to perform well, it requires access to a good reward function which is often sparse or manually engineered with scope for error. Introducing human prior knowledge is often seen as a possible solution to the above-mentioned problem, such as imitation learning, learning from preference, and inverse reinforcement learning. Learning from feedback is another framework that enables an RL agent to learn from binary evaluative signals describing the teacher's (positive or negative) evaluation of the agent's action. However, these methods often make the assumption that evaluative teacher feedback is perfect, which is a restrictive assumption. In practice, such feedback can be noisy due to limited teacher expertise or other exacerbating factors like cognitive load, availability, distraction, etc. In this work, we propose the CANDERE-COACH algorithm, which is capable of learning from noisy feedback by a nonoptimal teacher. We propose a noise-filtering mechanism to de-noise online feedback data, thereby enabling the RL agent to successfully learn with up to 40% of the teacher feedback being incorrect. Experiments on three common domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchao Li, Yuan Gong, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Annotating and recognizing speech emotion using prompt engineering has recently emerged with the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy and reliability remain questionable. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on this topic, beginning with the proposal of novel prompts that incorporate emotion-specific knowledge from acoustics, linguistics, and psychology. Subsequently, we examine the effectiveness of LLM-based prompting on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription, contrasting it with ground-truth transcription. Furthermore, we propose a Revise-Reason-Recognize prompting pipeline for robust LLM-based emotion recognition from spoken language with ASR errors. Additionally, experiments on context-aware learning, in-context learning, and instruction tuning are performed to examine the usefulness of LLM training schemes in this direction. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to minor prompt variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the emotion-specific prompts, ASR error correction, and LLM training schemes for LLM-based emotion recognition. Our study aims to refine the use of LLMs in emotion recognition and related domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brendan Hogan Rappazzo, Yingheng Wang, Aaron Ferber, Carla Gomes</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to form, retrieve, and reason about memories in response to stimuli serves as the cornerstone for general intelligence - shaping entities capable of learning, adaptation, and intuitive insight. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven their ability, given the proper memories or context, to reason and respond meaningfully to stimuli. However, they are still unable to optimally encode, store, and retrieve memories - the ability to do this would unlock their full ability to operate as AI agents, and to specialize to niche domains. To remedy this, one promising area of research is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which aims to augment LLMs by providing them with rich in-context examples and information. In question-answering (QA) applications, RAG methods embed the text of interest in chunks, and retrieve the most relevant chunks for a prompt using text embeddings. Motivated by human memory encoding and retrieval, we aim to improve over standard RAG methods by generating and encoding higher-level information and tagging the chunks by their utility to answer questions. We introduce Graphical Eigen Memories For Retrieval Augmented Generation (GEM-RAG). GEM-RAG works by tagging each chunk of text in a given text corpus with LLM generated ``utility'' questions, connecting chunks in a graph based on the similarity of both their text and utility questions, and then using the eigendecomposition of the memory graph to build higher level summary nodes that capture the main themes of the text. We evaluate GEM-RAG, using both UnifiedQA and GPT-3.5 Turbo as the LLMs, with SBERT, and OpenAI's text encoders on two standard QA tasks, showing that GEM-RAG outperforms other state-of-the-art RAG methods on these tasks. We also discuss the implications of having a robust RAG system and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Stuart Geiger, Flynn O'Sullivan, Elsie Wang, Jonathan Lo</p>
<p>Abstract: We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee's gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus employer. We find ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The largest gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across cases and model versions. We make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness literature. Our scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for the specific model versions we tested and ChatGPT as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Ding, Ziteng Wang, Chang Gao, Min Liu, Qinyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye tracking is a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR), but traditional frame-based systems struggle to meet XR's demands for high accuracy, low latency, and power efficiency. Event cameras offer a promising alternative due to their high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present FACET (Fast and Accurate Event-based Eye Tracking), an end-to-end neural network that directly outputs pupil ellipse parameters from event data, optimized for real-time XR applications. The ellipse output can be directly used in subsequent ellipse-based pupil trackers. We enhance the EV-Eye dataset by expanding annotated data and converting original mask labels to ellipse-based annotations to train the model. Besides, a novel trigonometric loss is adopted to address angle discontinuities and a fast causal event volume event representation method is put forward. On the enhanced EV-Eye test set, FACET achieves an average pupil center error of 0.20 pixels and an inference time of 0.53 ms, reducing pixel error and inference time by 1.6$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ compared to the prior art, EV-Eye, with 4.4$\times$ and 11.7$\times$ less parameters and arithmetic operations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosemary Y. He, Jeff N. Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyang Ying, Dongjie Wang, Xuanming Hu, Ji Qiu, Jin Park, Yanjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomarker discovery is vital in advancing personalized medicine, offering insights into disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic efficacy. Traditionally, the identification and validation of biomarkers heavily depend on extensive experiments and statistical analyses. These approaches are time-consuming, demand extensive domain expertise, and are constrained by the complexity of biological systems. These limitations motivate us to ask: Can we automatically identify the effective biomarker subset without substantial human efforts? Inspired by the success of generative AI, we think that the intricate knowledge of biomarker identification can be compressed into a continuous embedding space, thus enhancing the search for better biomarkers. Thus, we propose a new biomarker identification framework with two important modules:1) training data preparation and 2) embedding-optimization-generation. The first module uses a multi-agent system to automatically collect pairs of biomarker subsets and their corresponding prediction accuracy as training data. These data establish a strong knowledge base for biomarker identification. The second module employs an encoder-evaluator-decoder learning paradigm to compress the knowledge of the collected data into a continuous space. Then, it utilizes gradient-based search techniques and autoregressive-based reconstruction to efficiently identify the optimal subset of biomarkers. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to show the efficiency, robustness, and effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, John Sabatini, Conrad Borchers, Daniel Weitekamp, Meng Cao, John Hollander, Xiangen Hu, Arthur C. Graesser</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning performance data describe correct and incorrect answers or problem-solving attempts in adaptive learning, such as in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Learning performance data tend to be highly sparse (80\%\(\sim\)90\% missing observations) in most real-world applications due to adaptive item selection. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict future performance explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learner data to address data sparsity in learning performance data. First, learning performance is represented as a three-dimensional tensor of learners' questions, answers, and attempts, capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, a module for generating patterns of learning is used. This study contrasts two forms of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generate Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) to generate data associated with different clusters of learner data. We tested this approach on an adult literacy dataset from AutoTutor lessons developed for Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC). We found that: (1) tensor factorization improved the performance in tracing and predicting knowledge mastery compared with other knowledge tracing techniques without data augmentation, showing higher relative fidelity for this imputation method, and (2) the GAN-based simulation showed greater overall stability and less statistical bias based on a divergence evaluation with varying simulation sample sizes compared to GPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengju Wang, Bochao Liu, Dan Zeng, Chenggang Yan, Shiming Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: In practical scenarios, federated learning frequently necessitates training personalized models for each client using heterogeneous data. This paper proposes a backbone self-distillation approach to facilitate personalized federated learning. In this approach, each client trains its local model and only sends the backbone weights to the server. These weights are then aggregated to create a global backbone, which is returned to each client for updating. However, the client's local backbone lacks personalization because of the common representation. To solve this problem, each client further performs backbone self-distillation by using the global backbone as a teacher and transferring knowledge to update the local backbone. This process involves learning two components: the shared backbone for common representation and the private head for local personalization, which enables effective global knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments and comparisons with 12 state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Liu, Jiawei Du, Sicheng Xiang, Zibo Wang, Dingsheng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, agents need to decompose abstract instructions into detailed steps. Prior works mostly rely on GPT-4V for task decomposition into predefined actions, which limits task diversity due to GPT-4V's finite understanding of larger skillsets. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a groundbreaking framework for Real world Long-horizon Embodied Planning, which can accomplish a wide range of daily tasks. At its core lies a fine-tuned large vision language model that formulates plans as sequences of skill functions according to input instruction and scene image. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. Real-world off-line experiments across eight daily embodied tasks demonstrate that ReLEP is able to accomplish long-horizon embodied tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Yan, Ying Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have achieved significant success in various time series forecasting tasks. However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayeon Ki, Cheonbok Park, Hyunjoong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately aligning contextual representations in cross-lingual sentence embeddings is key for effective parallel data mining. A common strategy for achieving this alignment involves disentangling semantics and language in sentence embeddings derived from multilingual pre-trained models. However, we discover that current disentangled representation learning methods suffer from semantic leakage - a term we introduce to describe when a substantial amount of language-specific information is unintentionally leaked into semantic representations. This hinders the effective disentanglement of semantic and language representations, making it difficult to retrieve embeddings that distinctively represent the meaning of the sentence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training objective, ORthogonAlity Constraint LEarning (ORACLE), tailored to enforce orthogonality between semantic and language embeddings. ORACLE builds upon two components: intra-class clustering and inter-class separation. Through experiments on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks, we demonstrate that training with the ORACLE objective effectively reduces semantic leakage and enhances semantic alignment within the embedding space.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increasing application of automated robotic digestive endoscopy (RDE), ensuring safe and efficient navigation in the unstructured and narrow digestive tract has become a critical challenge. Existing automated reinforcement learning navigation algorithms, often result in potentially risky collisions due to the absence of essential human intervention, which significantly limits the safety and effectiveness of RDE in actual clinical practice. To address this limitation, we proposed a Human Intervention (HI)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework, dubbed HI-PPO, which incorporates expert knowledge to enhance RDE's safety. Specifically, we introduce an Enhanced Exploration Mechanism (EEM) to address the low exploration efficiency of the standard PPO. Additionally, a reward-penalty adjustment (RPA) is implemented to penalize unsafe actions during initial interventions. Furthermore, Behavior Cloning Similarity (BCS) is included as an auxiliary objective to ensure the agent emulates expert actions. Comparative experiments conducted in a simulated platform across various anatomical colon segments demonstrate that our model effectively and safely guides RDE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic Communication (SemCom) plays a pivotal role in 6G networks, offering a viable solution for future efficient communication. Deep Learning (DL)-based semantic codecs further enhance this efficiency. However, the vulnerability of DL models to security threats, such as adversarial attacks, poses significant challenges for practical applications of SemCom systems. These vulnerabilities enable attackers to tamper with messages and eavesdrop on private information, especially in wireless communication scenarios. Although existing defenses attempt to address specific threats, they often fail to simultaneously handle multiple heterogeneous attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based SemCom system. This system comprises a gating network and multiple experts, each specializing in different security challenges. The gating network adaptively selects suitable experts to counter heterogeneous attacks based on user-defined security requirements. Multiple experts collaborate to accomplish semantic communication tasks while meeting the security requirements of users. A case study in vehicular networks demonstrates the efficacy of the MoE-based SemCom system. Simulation results show that the proposed MoE-based SemCom system effectively mitigates concurrent heterogeneous attacks, with minimal impact on downstream task accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of understanding and interpreting the complex information encoded within genomic sequences remains a grand challenge in biological research and clinical applications. In this context, recent advancements in large language model research have led to the development of both encoder-only and decoder-only foundation models designed to decode intricate information in DNA sequences. However, several issues persist, particularly regarding the efficient management of long-range dependencies inherent in genomic sequences, the effective representation of nucleotide variations, and the considerable computational costs associated with large model architectures and extensive pretraining datasets. Current genomic foundation models often face a critical tradeoff: smaller models with mediocre performance versus large models with improved performance. To address these challenges, we introduce dnaGrinder, a unique and efficient genomic foundation model. dnaGrinder excels at managing long-range dependencies within genomic sequences while minimizing computational costs without compromising performance. It achieves results that are not just comparable but often superior to leading DNA models such as Nucleotide Transformer and DNABERT-2. Furthermore, dnaGrinder is designed for easy fine-tuning on workstation-grade GPUs, accommodating input lengths exceeding 17,000 tokens. On a single high-performance GPU, it supports sequences longer than 140,000 tokens, making it a highly efficient and accessible tool for both basic biological research and clinical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotional support is a crucial aspect of communication between community members and police dispatchers during incident reporting. However, there is a lack of understanding about how emotional support is delivered through text-based systems, especially in various non-emergency contexts. In this study, we analyzed two years of chat logs comprising 57,114 messages across 8,239 incidents from 130 higher education institutions. Our empirical findings revealed significant variations in emotional support provided by dispatchers, influenced by the type of incident, service time, and a noticeable decline in support over time across multiple organizations. To improve the consistency and quality of emotional support, we developed and implemented a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), named dispatcherLLM. We evaluated dispatcherLLM by comparing its generated responses to those of human dispatchers and other off-the-shelf models using real chat messages. Additionally, we conducted a human evaluation to assess the perceived effectiveness of the support provided by dispatcherLLM. This study not only contributes new empirical understandings of emotional support in text-based dispatch systems but also demonstrates the significant potential of generative AI in improving service delivery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bipedal locomotion control is essential for humanoid robots to navigate complex, human-centric environments. While optimization-based control designs are popular for integrating sophisticated models of humanoid robots, they often require labor-intensive manual tuning. In this work, we address the challenges of parameter selection in bipedal locomotion control using DiffTune, a model-based autotuning method that leverages differential programming for efficient parameter learning. A major difficulty lies in balancing model fidelity with differentiability. We address this difficulty using a low-fidelity model for differentiability, enhanced by a Ground Reaction Force-and-Moment Network (GRFM-Net) to capture discrepancies between MPC commands and actual control effects. We validate the parameters learned by DiffTune with GRFM-Net in hardware experiments, which demonstrates the parameters' optimality in a multi-objective setting compared with baseline parameters, reducing the total loss by up to 40.5$\%$ compared with the expert-tuned parameters. The results confirm the GRFM-Net's effectiveness in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, improving the transferability of simulation-learned parameters to real hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jixuan Cui, Jun Li, Zhen Mei, Yiyang Ni, Wen Chen, Zengxiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The challenge of data scarcity hinders the application of deep learning in industrial surface defect classification (SDC), as it's difficult to collect and centralize sufficient training data from various entities in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) provides a solution by enabling collaborative global model training across clients while maintaining privacy. However, performance may suffer due to data heterogeneity--discrepancies in data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL (PFL) approach, named Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL), for the challenge of data heterogeneity across different clients in SDC. First, we develop a dynamic consensus construction strategy to mitigate the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. Through adversarial training, local models from different clients utilize the global model as a bridge to achieve distribution alignment, alleviating the problem of global knowledge forgetting. Complementing this strategy, we propose a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism. It assigns aggregation weights to different clients based on their efficacy in global knowledge learning, thereby enhancing the global model's generalization capabilities. Finally, we design an adaptive feature fusion module to further enhance global knowledge utilization efficiency. Personalized fusion weights are gradually adjusted for each client to optimally balance global and local features, tailored to their individual global knowledge learning efficacy. Compared with state-of-the-art FL methods like FedALA, the proposed AFedCL method achieves an accuracy increase of up to 5.67% on three SDC datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayden McAlister, Anthony Robins, Lech Szymanski</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential learning involves learning tasks in a sequence, and proves challenging for most neural networks. Biological neural networks regularly conquer the sequential learning challenge and are even capable of transferring knowledge both forward and backwards between tasks. Artificial neural networks often totally fail to transfer performance between tasks, and regularly suffer from degraded performance or catastrophic forgetting on previous tasks. Models of associative memory have been used to investigate the discrepancy between biological and artificial neural networks due to their biological ties and inspirations, of which the Hopfield network is perhaps the most studied model. The Dense Associative Memory, or modern Hopfield network, generalizes the Hopfield network, allowing for greater capacities and prototype learning behaviors, while still retaining the associative memory structure. We investigate the performance of the Dense Associative Memory in sequential learning problems, and benchmark various sequential learning techniques in the network. We give a substantial review of the sequential learning space with particular respect to the Hopfield network and associative memories, as well as describe the techniques we implement in detail. We also draw parallels between the classical and Dense Associative Memory in the context of sequential learning, and discuss the departures from biological inspiration that may influence the utility of the Dense Associative Memory as a tool for studying biological neural networks. We present our findings, and show that existing sequential learning methods can be applied to the Dense Associative Memory to improve sequential learning performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyu Xiao, Jiang-Jiang Liu, Sen Yang, Xiaofan Li, Xiaoqing Ye, Wankou Yang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The autoregressive world model exhibits robust generalization capabilities in vectorized scene understanding but encounters difficulties in deriving actions due to insufficient uncertainty modeling and self-delusion. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of deriving decisions from an autoregressive world model by addressing these challenges through the formulation of multiple probabilistic hypotheses. We propose LatentDriver, a framework models the environment's next states and the ego vehicle's possible actions as a mixture distribution, from which a deterministic control signal is then derived. By incorporating mixture modeling, the stochastic nature of decisionmaking is captured. Additionally, the self-delusion problem is mitigated by providing intermediate actions sampled from a distribution to the world model. Experimental results on the recently released close-loop benchmark Waymax demonstrate that LatentDriver surpasses state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods, achieving expert-level performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Jin, Danni Zhang, Gangming Zhao, Changde Du, Jinpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition has gained significant traction due to its accuracy and objectivity. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals leads to distribution drift over time, causing severe performance degradation when the model is reused. While numerous domain adaptation (DA) approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this issue, their reliance on large amounts of target data for calibration restricts them to offline scenarios, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Evolvable Fast Adaptation (EvoFA), an online adaptive framework tailored for EEG data. EvoFA organically integrates the rapid adaptation of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and the distribution matching of Domain Adaptation (DA) through a two-stage generalization process. During the training phase, a robust base meta-learning model is constructed for strong generalization. In the testing phase, a designed evolvable meta-adaptation module iteratively aligns the marginal distribution of target (testing) data with the evolving source (training) data within a model-agnostic meta-learning framework, enabling the model to learn the evolving trends of testing data relative to training data and improving online testing performance. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoFA achieves significant improvements compared to the basic FSL method and previous online methods. The introduction of EvoFA paves the way for broader adoption of EEG-based emotion recognition in real-world applications. Our code will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satvik Golechha, Dylan Cope, Nandi Schoots</p>
<p>Abstract: An approach to improve network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We find pretrained models to be highly unclusterable and thus train models to be more modular using an ``enmeshment loss'' function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. Using automated interpretability measures, we show that our method finds clusters that learn different, disjoint, and smaller circuits for CIFAR-10 labels. Our approach provides a promising direction for making neural networks easier to interpret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanwen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Wei Zhang, Changyuan Zhao, Hongyang Du, Abbas Jamalipour, Sumei Sun, Yiyang Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, their capability to generate content is seeing significant enhancement, leading to widespread applications in the field of data generation and forecasting. Furthermore, GenAI has strong capabilities in data modeling and analysis, which enhances Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) applications in various aspects. In this paper, we investigate and survey applications of GenAI in the IoEV. Specifically, we categorize GenAI for IoEV into four different layers namely, EV's battery layer, individual electric vehicle (EV) layer, smart grid with EV layer, and security layer. We first introduce various GenAI techniques used in each layer of IoEV applications. Subsequently, public datasets available for training the GenAI models are summarized. Finally, we provide recommendations for future directions. This survey not only categorizes the applications of GenAI in IoEV across different layers but also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by highlighting the design and implementation challenges within each layer. Furthermore, it provides a roadmap for future research directions, enabling the development of more robust and efficient IoEV systems through the integration of advanced GenAI techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseok Lim, Inbeom Park, Sujee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Appropriate medication dosages in the intensive care unit (ICU) are critical for patient survival. Heparin, used to treat thrombosis and inhibit blood clotting in the ICU, requires careful administration due to its complexity and sensitivity to various factors, including patient clinical characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and potential drug interactions. Incorrect dosing can lead to severe complications such as strokes or excessive bleeding. To address these challenges, this study proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based personalized optimal heparin dosing policy that guides dosing decisions reliably within the therapeutic range based on individual patient conditions. A batch-constrained policy was implemented to minimize out-of-distribution errors in an offline RL environment and effectively integrate RL with existing clinician policies. The policy's effectiveness was evaluated using weighted importance sampling, an off-policy evaluation method, and the relationship between state representations and Q-values was explored using t-SNE. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed RL-based medication policy. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and extensive clinical data, this research enhances heparin administration practices and establishes a precedent for the development of sophisticated decision-support tools in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dohyeong Kim, Hyeokjin Kwon, Junseok Kim, Gunmin Lee, Songhwai Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: As the complexity of tasks addressed through reinforcement learning (RL) increases, the definition of reward functions also has become highly complicated. We introduce an RL method aimed at simplifying the reward-shaping process through intuitive strategies. Initially, instead of a single reward function composed of various terms, we define multiple reward and cost functions within a constrained multi-objective RL (CMORL) framework. For tasks involving sequential complex movements, we segment the task into distinct stages and define multiple rewards and costs for each stage. Finally, we introduce a practical CMORL algorithm that maximizes objectives based on these rewards while satisfying constraints defined by the costs. The proposed method has been successfully demonstrated across a variety of acrobatic tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. Additionally, it has been shown to successfully perform tasks compared to existing RL and constrained RL algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/rllab-snu/Stage-Wise-CMORL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Ye, Haowei Lin, Jiaqi Han, Minkai Xu, Sheng Liu, Yitao Liang, Jianzhu Ma, James Zou, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an unconditional diffusion model and a predictor for a target property of interest (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. Existing methods, though effective in various individual applications, often lack theoretical grounding and rigorous testing on extensive benchmarks. As a result, they could even fail on simple tasks, and applying them to a new problem becomes unavoidably difficult. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework encompassing existing methods as special cases, unifying the study of training-free guidance into the analysis of an algorithm-agnostic design space. Via theoretical and empirical investigation, we propose an efficient and effective hyper-parameter searching strategy that can be readily applied to any downstream task. We systematically benchmark across 7 diffusion models on 16 tasks with 40 targets, and improve performance by 8.5% on average. Our framework and benchmark offer a solid foundation for conditional generation in a training-free manner.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), the quality of retrieved information is critical to the final output. This paper introduces the IRSC benchmark for evaluating the performance of embedding models in multilingual RAG tasks. The benchmark encompasses five retrieval tasks: query retrieval, title retrieval, part-of-paragraph retrieval, keyword retrieval, and summary retrieval. Our research addresses the current lack of comprehensive testing and effective comparison methods for embedding models in RAG scenarios. We introduced new metrics: the Similarity of Semantic Comprehension Index (SSCI) and the Retrieval Capability Contest Index (RCCI), and evaluated models such as Snowflake-Arctic, BGE, GTE, and M3E. Our contributions include: 1) the IRSC benchmark, 2) the SSCI and RCCI metrics, and 3) insights into the cross-lingual limitations of embedding models. The IRSC benchmark aims to enhance the understanding and development of accurate retrieval systems in RAG tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Wu, Fan Liu, Jindong Han, Yuxuan Liang, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As various types of crime continue to threaten public safety and economic development, predicting the occurrence of multiple types of crimes becomes increasingly vital for effective prevention measures. Although extensive efforts have been made, most of them overlook the heterogeneity of different crime categories and fail to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (ST-MoGE) framework for collective multiple-type crime prediction. To enhance the model's ability to identify diverse spatial-temporal dependencies and mitigate potential conflicts caused by spatial-temporal heterogeneity of different crime categories, we introduce an attentive-gated Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (MGEs) module to capture the distinctive and shared crime patterns of each crime category. Then, we propose Cross-Expert Contrastive Learning(CECL) to update the MGEs and force each expert to focus on specific pattern modeling, thereby reducing blending and redundancy. Furthermore, to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Loss Re-weighting (HALR) approach to eliminate biases and insufficient learning of data-scarce regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world crime datasets and compare our results with twelve advanced baselines. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs), despite their widespread adoption in modern smart devices, have received significantly less academic attention compared to their large language model (LLM) counterparts, which are predominantly deployed in data centers and cloud environments. While researchers continue to improve the capabilities of LLMs in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence, SLM research aims to make machine intelligence more accessible, affordable, and efficient for everyday tasks. Focusing on transformer-based, decoder-only language models with 100M-5B parameters, we survey 59 state-of-the-art open-source SLMs, analyzing their technical innovations across three axes: architectures, training datasets, and training algorithms. In addition, we evaluate their capabilities in various domains, including commonsense reasoning, in-context learning, mathematics, and coding. To gain further insight into their on-device runtime costs, we benchmark their inference latency and memory footprints. Through in-depth analysis of our benchmarking data, we offer valuable insights to advance research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxing Zhou, Jiaqi Ye, Shubao Zhao, Ming Jin, Zhaoxiang Hou, Chengyi Yang, Zengxiang Li, Yanlong Wen, Xiaojie Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of global energy strategy, accurate natural gas demand forecasting is crucial for ensuring efficient resource allocation and operational planning. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to cope with the growing complexity and variability of gas consumption patterns across diverse industries and commercial sectors. To address these challenges, we propose the first foundation model specifically tailored for natural gas demand forecasting. Foundation models, known for their ability to generalize across tasks and datasets, offer a robust solution to the limitations of traditional methods, such as the need for separate models for different customer segments and their limited generalization capabilities. Our approach leverages contrastive learning to improve prediction accuracy in real-world scenarios, particularly by tackling issues such as noise in historical consumption data and the potential misclassification of similar data samples, which can lead to degradation in the quaility of the representation and thus the accuracy of downstream forecasting tasks. By integrating advanced noise filtering techniques within the contrastive learning framework, our model enhances the quality of learned representations, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the model undergoes industry-specific fine-tuning during pretraining, enabling it to better capture the unique characteristics of gas consumption across various sectors. We conducted extensive experiments using a large-scale dataset from ENN Group, which includes data from over 10,000 industrial, commercial, and welfare-related customers across multiple regions. Our model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a relative improvement in MSE by 3.68\% and in MASE by 6.15\% compared to the best available model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Merging parameters of multiple models has resurfaced as an effective strategy to enhance task performance and robustness, but prior work is limited by the high costs of ensemble creation and inference. In this paper, we leverage the abundance of freely accessible trained models to introduce a cost-free approach to model merging. It focuses on a layer-wise integration of merged models, aiming to maintain the distinctiveness of the task-specific final layers while unifying the initial layers, which are primarily associated with feature extraction. This approach ensures parameter consistency across all layers, essential for boosting performance. Moreover, it facilitates seamless integration of knowledge, enabling effective merging of models from different datasets and tasks. Specifically, we investigate its applicability in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), an unexplored area for model merging, for Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial UDA improvements without additional costs for merging same-architecture models from distinct datasets ($\uparrow 2.6\%$ mIoU) and different-architecture models with a shared backbone ($\uparrow 6.8\%$ mIoU). Furthermore, merging Semantic and Panoptic Segmentation models increases mPQ by $\uparrow 7\%$. These findings are validated across a wide variety of UDA strategies, architectures, and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: A growing research explores the usage of AI explanations on user's decision phases for human-AI collaborative decision-making. However, previous studies found the issues of overreliance on `wrong' AI outputs. In this paper, we propose interactive example-based explanations to improve health professionals' onboarding with AI for their better reliance on AI during AI-assisted decision-making. We implemented an AI-based decision support system that utilizes a neural network to assess the quality of post-stroke survivors' exercises and interactive example-based explanations that systematically surface the nearest neighborhoods of a test/task sample from the training set of the AI model to assist users' onboarding with the AI model. To investigate the effect of interactive example-based explanations, we conducted a study with domain experts, health professionals to evaluate their performance and reliance on AI. Our interactive example-based explanations during onboarding assisted health professionals in having a better reliance on AI and making a higher ratio of making `right' decisions and a lower ratio of `wrong' decisions than providing only feature-based explanations during the decision-support phase. Our study discusses new challenges of assisting user's onboarding with AI for human-AI collaborative decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Ye, Yuming Yang, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang, Peng Wang, Zhongchao Shi, Jianping Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode extensive world knowledge through pre-training on massive datasets, which can then be fine-tuned for the question-answering (QA) task. However, effective strategies for fine-tuning LLMs for the QA task remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we categorize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data based on the extent of knowledge memorized by the pretrained LLMs and conduct a series of empirical analyses. Our experiments, involving four LLMs from three different model families, focus on three key factors: the amount of data required for SFT, the impact of different SFT datasets on model performance, and how data requirements vary across LLMs. The results show that as few as 60 data points during the SFT stage can activate the knowledge encoded during pre-training, enabling LLMs to perform the QA task. Additionally, SFT with data of varying memory levels has a significant impact on LLM performance, with the optimal dataset differing based on the specific model being fine-tuned. Future research will delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce adaptive learn-then-test (aLTT), an efficient hyperparameter selection procedure that provides finite-sample statistical guarantees on the population risk of AI models. Unlike the existing learn-then-test (LTT) technique, which relies on conventional p-value-based multiple hypothesis testing (MHT), aLTT implements sequential data-dependent MHT with early termination by leveraging e-processes. As a result, aLTT can reduce the number of testing rounds, making it particularly well-suited for scenarios in which testing is costly or presents safety risks. Apart from maintaining statistical validity, in applications such as online policy selection for offline reinforcement learning and hyperparameter tuning for engineering systems, aLTT is shown to achieve the same performance as LTT while requiring only a fraction of the testing rounds.</p>

Neural networks are used to identify a discrete-time nonlinear state- space model to approximate time-domain input-output behavior of a nonlinear system. The network is constructed such that the identified model is approximately linearizable by feedback, ensuring that the control law trivially follows from the learning stage. After the identification and quasi-linearization procedures, linear control theory comes at hand to design robust controllers and study stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness and interest of the methodology are illustrated throughout the paper on popular benchmarks for system identification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is crucial for understanding user needs and executing appro- priate system actions in task-oriented dialogues. Majority of existing DST methods are designed to work within predefined ontologies and as- sume the availability of gold domain labels, struggling with adapting to new slots values. While Large Language Models (LLMs)-based systems show promising zero-shot DST perfor- mance, they either require extensive computa- tional resources or they underperform existing fully-trained systems, limiting their practical- ity. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot, open-vocabulary system that in- tegrates domain classification and DST in a single pipeline. Our approach includes refor- mulating DST as a question-answering task for less capable models and employing self- refining prompts for more adaptable ones. Our system does not rely on fixed slot values de- fined in the ontology allowing the system to adapt dynamically. We compare our approach with existing SOTA, and show that it provides up to 20% better Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA) over previous methods on datasets like Multi- WOZ 2.1, with up to 90% fewer requests to the LLM API.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional robot simulators focus on physical process modeling and realistic rendering, often suffering from high computational costs, inefficiencies, and limited adaptability. To handle this issue, we propose Behavior Simulation in robotics to emphasize checking the behavior logic of robots and achieving sufficient alignment between the outcome of robot actions and real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce BeSimulator, a modular and novel LLM-powered framework, as an attempt towards behavior simulation in the context of text-based environments. By constructing text-based virtual environments and performing semantic-level simulation, BeSimulator can generalize across scenarios and achieve long-horizon complex simulation. Inspired by human cognition processes, it employs a "consider-decide-capture-transfer" methodology, termed Chain of Behavior Simulation, which excels at analyzing action feasibility and state transitions. Additionally, BeSimulator incorporates code-driven reasoning to enable arithmetic operations and enhance reliability, as well as integrates reflective feedback to refine simulation. Based on our manually constructed behavior-tree-based simulation benchmark BTSIMBENCH, our experiments show a significant performance improvement in behavior simulation compared to baselines, ranging from 14.7% to 26.6%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large transformer-based models have significant potential for speech transcription and translation. Their self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing enable them to capture complex patterns and dependencies in audio sequences. However, this potential comes with challenges, as these large and computationally intensive models lead to slow inference speeds. Various optimization strategies have been proposed to improve performance, including efficient hardware utilization and algorithmic enhancements. In this paper, we introduce Whisper-Medusa, a novel approach designed to enhance processing speed with minimal impact on Word Error Rate (WER). The proposed model extends the OpenAI's Whisper architecture by predicting multiple tokens per iteration, resulting in a 50% reduction in latency. We showcase the effectiveness of Whisper-Medusa across different learning setups and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wei, Jiawei Zhen, Zongyao Li, Zhanglin Wu, Daimeng Wei, Jiaxin Guo, Zhiqiang Rao, Shaojun Li, Yuanchang Luo, Hengchao Shang, Jinlong Yang, Yuhao Xie, Hao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the submission by Huawei Translation Center (HW-TSC) to the WMT24 Indian Languages Machine Translation (MT) Shared Task. To develop a reliable machine translation system for low-resource Indian languages, we employed two distinct knowledge transfer strategies, taking into account the characteristics of the language scripts and the support available from existing open-source models for Indian languages. For Assamese(as) and Manipuri(mn), we fine-tuned the existing IndicTrans2 open-source model to enable bidirectional translation between English and these languages. For Khasi (kh) and Mizo (mz), We trained a multilingual model as a baseline using bilingual data from these four language pairs, along with an additional about 8kw English-Bengali bilingual data, all of which share certain linguistic features. This was followed by fine-tuning to achieve bidirectional translation between English and Khasi, as well as English and Mizo. Our transfer learning experiments produced impressive results: 23.5 BLEU for en-as, 31.8 BLEU for en-mn, 36.2 BLEU for as-en, and 47.9 BLEU for mn-en on their respective test sets. Similarly, the multilingual model transfer learning experiments yielded impressive outcomes, achieving 19.7 BLEU for en-kh, 32.8 BLEU for en-mz, 16.1 BLEU for kh-en, and 33.9 BLEU for mz-en on their respective test sets. These results not only highlight the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques for low-resource languages but also contribute to advancing machine translation capabilities for low-resource Indian languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengrun Zhang, Wang Geng, Hukai Huang, Cheng Yi, He Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a speech-conditioned Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based connector to address the challenge of Code-Switching (CS) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Specifically, we propose an Insertion and Deletion of Interruption Token (IDIT) mechanism for better transfer text generation ability of LLM to speech recognition task. We also present a connecter with MoE architecture that manages multiple languages efficiently. To further enhance the collaboration of multiple experts and leverage the understanding capabilities of LLM, we propose a two-stage progressive training strategy: 1) The connector is unfrozen and trained with language-specialized experts to map speech representations to the text space. 2) The connector and LLM LoRA adaptor are trained with the proposed IDIT mechanism and all experts are activated to learn general representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including end-to-end and large-scale audio-language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Ma, Xin Tian, Lingxiang Wu, Xuepeng Wang, Xueming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a subtask in semantic parsing that has seen rapid progress with the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs face challenges due to hallucination issues and a lack of domain-specific database knowledge(such as table schema and cell values). As a result, they can make errors in generating table names, columns, and matching values to the correct columns in SQL statements. This paper introduces a method of knowledge injection to enhance LLMs' ability to understand schema contents by incorporating prior knowledge. This approach improves their performance in Text-to-SQL tasks. Experimental results show that pre-training LLMs on domain-specific database knowledge and fine-tuning them on downstream Text-to-SQL tasks significantly improves the Execution Match (EX) and Exact Match (EM) metrics across various models. This effectively reduces errors in generating column names and matching values to the columns. Furthermore, the knowledge-injected models can be applied to many downstream Text-to-SQL tasks, demonstrating the generalizability of the approach presented in this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Arcadinho, David Aparicio, Mariana Almeida</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented LLMs are a promising approach to create AI agents that can have realistic conversations, follow procedures, and call appropriate functions. However, evaluating them is challenging due to the diversity of possible conversations, and existing datasets focus only on single interactions and function-calling. We present a test generation pipeline to evaluate LLMs as conversational AI agents. Our framework uses LLMs to generate diverse tests grounded on user-defined procedures. For that, we use intermediate graphs to limit the LLM test generator's tendency to hallucinate content that is not grounded on input procedures, and enforces high coverage of the possible conversations. Additionally, we put forward ALMITA, a manually curated dataset for evaluating AI agents in customer support, and use it to evaluate existing LLMs. Our results show that while tool-augmented LLMs perform well in single interactions, they often struggle to handle complete conversations. While our focus is on customer support, our method is general and capable of AI agents for different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu He, Chenlin Wu, Zike Li, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed learning framework which enables clients to train models individually and to upload their model updates for aggregation. The local training process heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims to design a generalizable method that can be used to detect anomalies when only normal sounds are given. In this paper, Anomalous Sound Detection based on Diffusion Models (ASD-Diffusion) is proposed for ASD in real-world factories. In our pipeline, the anomalies in acoustic features are reconstructed from their noisy corrupted features into their approximate normal pattern. Secondly, a post-processing anomalies filter algorithm is proposed to detect anomalies that exhibit significant deviation from the original input after reconstruction. Furthermore, denoising diffusion implicit model is introduced to accelerate the inference speed by a longer sampling interval of the denoising process. The proposed method is innovative in the application of diffusion models as a new scheme. Experimental results on the development set of DCASE 2023 challenge task 2 outperform the baseline by 7.75%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: To obtain the optimal constraints in complex environments, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) seeks to recover these constraints from expert demonstrations in a data-driven manner. Existing ICRL algorithms collect training samples from an interactive environment. However, the efficacy and efficiency of these sampling strategies remain unknown. To bridge this gap, we introduce a strategic exploration framework with provable efficiency. Specifically, we define a feasible constraint set for ICRL problems and investigate how expert policy and environmental dynamics influence the optimality of constraints. Motivated by our findings, we propose two exploratory algorithms to achieve efficient constraint inference via 1) dynamically reducing the bounded aggregate error of cost estimation and 2) strategically constraining the exploration policy. Both algorithms are theoretically grounded with tractable sample complexity. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms under various environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roan Schellingerhout, Francesco Barile, Nava Tintarev</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased use of information retrieval in recruitment, primarily through job recommender systems (JRSs), can have a large impact on job seekers, recruiters, and companies. As a result, such systems have been determined to be high-risk in recent legislature. This requires JRSs to be trustworthy and transparent, allowing stakeholders to understand why specific recommendations were made. To fulfill this requirement, the stakeholders' exact preferences and needs need to be determined. To do so, we evaluated an explainable job recommender system using a realistic, task-based, mixed-design user study (n=30) in which stakeholders had to make decisions based on the model's explanations. This mixed-methods evaluation consisted of two objective metrics - correctness and efficiency, along with three subjective metrics - trust, transparency, and usefulness. These metrics were evaluated twice per participant, once using real explanations and once using random explanations. The study included a qualitative analysis following a think-aloud protocol while performing tasks adapted to each stakeholder group. We find that providing stakeholders with real explanations does not significantly improve decision-making speed and accuracy. Our results showed a non-significant trend for the real explanations to outperform the random ones on perceived trust, usefulness, and transparency of the system for all stakeholder types. We determine that stakeholders benefit more from interacting with explanations as decision support capable of providing healthy friction, rather than as previously-assumed persuasive tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Palena, Tania Cerquitelli, Carla Fabiana Chiasserini</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the proliferation of Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices and the rapid advances in the field of deep learning, there is a growing interest in pushing deep learning computations, conventionally handled by the cloud, to the edge of the network to deliver faster responses to end users, reduce bandwidth consumption to the cloud, and address privacy concerns. However, to fully realize deep learning at the edge, two main challenges still need to be addressed: (i) how to meet the high resource requirements of deep learning on resource-constrained devices, and (ii) how to leverage the availability of multiple streams of spatially correlated data, to increase the effectiveness of deep learning and improve application-level performance. To address the above challenges, we explore collaborative inference at the edge, in which edge nodes and end devices share correlated data and the inference computational burden by leveraging different ways to split computation and fuse data. Besides traditional centralized and distributed schemes for edge-end device collaborative inference, we introduce selective schemes that decrease bandwidth resource consumption by effectively reducing data redundancy. As a reference scenario, we focus on multi-view classification in a networked system in which sensing nodes can capture overlapping fields of view. The proposed schemes are compared in terms of accuracy, computational expenditure at the nodes, communication overhead, inference latency, robustness, and noise sensitivity. Experimental results highlight that selective collaborative schemes can achieve different trade-offs between the above performance metrics, with some of them bringing substantial communication savings (from 18% to 74% of the transmitted data with respect to centralized inference) while still keeping the inference accuracy well above 90%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengrun Zhang, Wangjin Zhou, Yiming Liu, Wang Geng, Yahui Shan, Chen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been an increasing research interest in cross-age speaker verification~(CASV). However, existing speaker verification systems perform poorly in CASV due to the great individual differences in voice caused by aging. In this paper, we propose a disentangled representation learning framework for CASV based on mutual information~(MI) minimization. In our method, a backbone model is trained to disentangle the identity- and age-related embeddings from speaker information, and an MI estimator is trained to minimize the correlation between age- and identity-related embeddings via MI minimization, resulting in age-invariant speaker embeddings. Furthermore, by using the age gaps between positive and negative samples, we propose an aging-aware MI minimization loss function that allows the backbone model to focus more on the vocal changes with large age gaps. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods on multiple Cross-Age test sets of Vox-CA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional machine learning-based visual inspection systems require extensive data collection and repetitive model training to improve accuracy. These systems typically require expensive camera, computing equipment and significant machine learning ex- pertise, which can substantially burden small and medium-sized enterprises. This study explores leveraging unsupervised learning methods with pre-trained models and low-cost hardware to create a cost-effective visual anomaly detection system. The research aims to develop a low-cost visual anomaly detection solution that uses minimal data for model training while maintaining general- izability and scalability. The system utilises unsupervised learning models from Anomalib and is deployed on affordable Raspberry Pi hardware through openVINO. The results show that this cost-effective system can complete anomaly defection training and inference on a Raspberry Pi in just 90 seconds using only 10 normal product images, achieving an F1 macro score exceeding 0.95. While the system is slightly sensitive to environmental changes like lighting, product positioning, or background, it remains a swift and economical method for factory automation inspection for small and medium-sized manufacturers</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuo Chen, Jiqun Liu, Xiaoyu Dong, Qijiong Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive biases are systematic deviations in thinking that lead to irrational judgments and problematic decision-making, extensively studied across various fields. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown advanced understanding capabilities but may inherit human biases from their training data. While social biases in LLMs have been well-studied, cognitive biases have received less attention, with existing research focusing on specific scenarios. The broader impact of cognitive biases on LLMs in various decision- making contexts remains underexplored. We investigated whether LLMs are influenced by the threshold priming effect in relevance judgments, a core task and widely-discussed research topic in the Information Retrieval (IR) coummunity. The priming effect occurs when exposure to certain stimuli unconsciously affects subsequent behavior and decisions. Our experiment employed 10 topics from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning passage track collection, and tested AI judgments under different document relevance scores, batch lengths, and LLM models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2-13B and LLaMa2-70B. Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination and model used. Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR tasks and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xenios Milidonis, Francesco Banterle, Alessandro Artusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Acquisition of high dynamic range (HDR) images is thriving due to the increasing use of smart devices and the demand for high-quality output. Extensive research has focused on developing methods for reducing the luminance range in HDR images using conventional and deep learning-based tone mapping operators to enable accurate reproduction on conventional 8 and 10-bit digital displays. However, these methods often fail to account for pixels that may lie outside the target display's gamut, resulting in visible chromatic distortions or color clipping artifacts. Previous studies suggested that a gamut management step ensures that all pixels remain within the target gamut. However, such approaches are computationally expensive and cannot be deployed on devices with limited computational resources. We propose a generative adversarial network for fast and reliable chroma compression of HDR tone-mapped images. We design a loss function that considers the hue property of generated images to improve color accuracy, and train the model on an extensive image dataset. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art image generation and enhancement networks in color accuracy, while a subjective study suggests that the generated images are on par or superior to those produced by conventional chroma compression methods in terms of visual quality. Additionally, the model achieves real-time performance, showing promising results for deployment on devices with limited computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Shi, Shiyu Wang, Yuqi Nie, Dianqi Li, Zhou Ye, Qingsong Wen, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Combining manipulation with the mobility of legged robots is essential for a wide range of robotic applications. However, integrating an arm with a mobile base significantly increases the system's complexity, making precise end-effector control challenging. Existing model-based approaches are often constrained by their modeling assumptions, leading to limited robustness. Meanwhile, recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations restrict the arm's workspace to be in front of the robot or track only the position to obtain decent tracking accuracy. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a large workspace on rough, unstructured terrains. Our proposed method involves a terrain-aware sampling strategy for the robot's initial configuration and end-effector pose commands, as well as a game-based curriculum to extend the robot's operating range. We validate our approach on the ANYmal quadrupedal robot with a six DoF robotic arm. Through our experiments, we show that the learned controller achieves precise command tracking over a large workspace and adapts across varying terrains such as stairs and slopes. On deployment, it achieves a pose-tracking error of 2.64 cm and 3.64 degrees, outperforming existing competitive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuguang Yao, Anil Jain, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking is an essential technique for embedding an identifier (i.e., watermark message) within digital images to assert ownership and monitor unauthorized alterations. In face recognition systems, watermarking plays a pivotal role in ensuring data integrity and security. However, an adversary could potentially interfere with the watermarking process, significantly impairing recognition performance. We explore the interaction between watermarking and adversarial attacks on face recognition models. Our findings reveal that while watermarking or input-level perturbation alone may have a negligible effect on recognition accuracy, the combined effect of watermarking and perturbation can result in an adversarial watermarking attack, significantly degrading recognition performance. Specifically, we introduce a novel threat model, the adversarial watermarking attack, which remains stealthy in the absence of watermarking, allowing images to be correctly recognized initially. However, once watermarking is applied, the attack is activated, causing recognition failures. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized vulnerability: adversarial perturbations can exploit the watermark message to evade face recognition systems. Evaluated on the CASIA-WebFace dataset, our proposed adversarial watermarking attack reduces face matching accuracy by 67.2% with an $\ell_\infty$ norm-measured perturbation strength of ${2}/{255}$ and by 95.9% with a strength of ${4}/{255}$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianda Zhang, Siyuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection models, widely used in security-critical applications, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that cause targeted misclassifications when triggered by specific patterns. Existing backdoor defense techniques, primarily designed for simpler models like image classifiers, often fail to effectively detect and remove backdoors in object detectors. We propose a backdoor defense framework tailored to object detection models, based on the observation that backdoor attacks cause significant inconsistencies between local modules' behaviors, such as the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and classification head. By quantifying and analyzing these inconsistencies, we develop an algorithm to detect backdoors. We find that the inconsistent module is usually the main source of backdoor behavior, leading to a removal method that localizes the affected module, resets its parameters, and fine-tunes the model on a small clean dataset. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art two-stage object detectors show our method achieves a 90% improvement in backdoor removal rate over fine-tuning baselines, while limiting clean data accuracy loss to less than 4%. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first approach that addresses both the detection and removal of backdoors in two-stage object detection models, advancing the field of securing these complex systems against backdoor attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viola Negroni, Davide Salvi, Alessandro Ilic Mezza, Paolo Bestagini, Stefano Tubaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech deepfakes pose a significant threat to personal security and content authenticity. Several detectors have been proposed in the literature, and one of the primary challenges these systems have to face is the generalization over unseen data to identify fake signals across a wide range of datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for enhancing speech deepfake detection performance using a Mixture of Experts architecture. The Mixture of Experts framework is well-suited for the speech deepfake detection task due to its ability to specialize in different input types and handle data variability efficiently. This approach offers superior generalization and adaptability to unseen data compared to traditional single models or ensemble methods. Additionally, its modular structure supports scalable updates, making it more flexible in managing the evolving complexity of deepfake techniques while maintaining high detection accuracy. We propose an efficient, lightweight gating mechanism to dynamically assign expert weights for each input, optimizing detection performance. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhili Lai, Chunmei Qing, Junpeng Tan, Wanxiang Luo, Xiangmin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals for emotion recognition is a significant advancement in understanding human emotions. However, due to the lack of artificial intelligence data and algorithms in this field, current research faces the following challenges: 1) The portable wearable devices have higher requirements for lightweight models; 2) The objective differences of physiology and psychology among different subjects aggravate the difficulty of emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-subject fNIRS emotion recognition method, called the Online Multi-level Contrastive Representation Distillation framework (OMCRD). Specifically, OMCRD is a framework designed for mutual learning among multiple lightweight student networks. It utilizes multi-level fNIRS feature extractor for each sub-network and conducts multi-view sentimental mining using physiological signals. The proposed Inter-Subject Interaction Contrastive Representation (IS-ICR) facilitates knowledge transfer for interactions between student models, enhancing cross-subject emotion recognition performance. The optimal student network can be selected and deployed on a wearable device. Some experimental results demonstrate that OMCRD achieves state-of-the-art results in emotional perception and affective imagery tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan DeAndres-Tame, Muhammad Faisal, Ruben Tolosana, Rouqaiah Al-Refai, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Philipp Terh\"orst</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) has advanced significantly with the development of deep learning, achieving high accuracy in several applications. However, the lack of interpretability of these systems raises concerns about their accountability, fairness, and reliability. In the present study, we propose an interactive framework to enhance the explainability of FR models by combining model-agnostic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The proposed framework is able to accurately answer various questions of the user through an interactive chatbot. In particular, the explanations generated by our proposed method are in the form of natural language text and visual representations, which for example can describe how different facial regions contribute to the similarity measure between two faces. This is achieved through the automatic analysis of the output's saliency heatmaps of the face images and a BERT question-answering model, providing users with an interface that facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the FR decisions. The proposed approach is interactive, allowing the users to ask questions to get more precise information based on the user's background knowledge. More importantly, in contrast to previous studies, our solution does not decrease the face recognition performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through different experiments, highlighting its potential to make FR systems more interpretable and user-friendly, especially in sensitive applications where decision-making transparency is crucial.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile health has the potential to revolutionize health care delivery and patient engagement. In this work, we discuss how integrating Artificial Intelligence into digital health applications-focused on supply chain, patient management, and capacity building, among other use cases-can improve the health system and public health performance. We present an Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning platform that allows the delivery of adaptive interventions whose impact can be optimized through experimentation and real-time monitoring. The system can integrate multiple data sources and digital health applications. The flexibility of this platform to connect to various mobile health applications and digital devices and send personalized recommendations based on past data and predictions can significantly improve the impact of digital tools on health system outcomes. The potential for resource-poor settings, where the impact of this approach on health outcomes could be more decisive, is discussed specifically. This framework is, however, similarly applicable to improving efficiency in health systems where scarcity is not an issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Magrini, Federico Becattini, Pietro Pala, Alberto Del Bimbo, Antonio Porta</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, drone detection has quickly become a subject of extreme interest: the potential for fast-moving objects of contained dimensions to be used for malicious intents or even terrorist attacks has posed attention to the necessity for precise and resilient systems for detecting and identifying such elements. While extensive literature and works exist on object detection based on RGB data, it is also critical to recognize the limits of such modality when applied to UAVs detection. Detecting drones indeed poses several challenges such as fast-moving objects and scenes with a high dynamic range or, even worse, scarce illumination levels. Neuromorphic cameras, on the other hand, can retain precise and rich spatio-temporal information in situations that are challenging for RGB cameras. They are resilient to both high-speed moving objects and scarce illumination settings, while prone to suffer a rapid loss of information when the objects in the scene are static. In this context, we present a novel model for integrating both domains together, leveraging multimodal data to take advantage of the best of both worlds. To this end, we also release NeRDD (Neuromorphic-RGB Drone Detection), a novel spatio-temporally synchronized Event-RGB Drone detection dataset of more than 3.5 hours of multimodal annotated recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehtab Ur Rahman, Martha Larson, Louis ten Bosch, Cristian Tejedor-Garc\'ia</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech recordings are being more frequently used to detect and monitor disease, leading to privacy concerns. Beyond cryptography, protection of speech can be addressed by approaches, such as perturbation, disentanglement, and re-synthesis, that eliminate sensitive information of the speaker, leaving the information necessary for medical analysis purposes. In order for such privacy protective approaches to be developed, clear and systematic specifications of assumptions concerning medical settings and the needs of medical professionals are necessary. In this paper, we propose a Scenario of Use Scheme that incorporates an Attacker Model, which characterizes the adversary against whom the speaker's privacy must be defended, and a Protector Model, which specifies the defense. We discuss the connection of the scheme with previous work on speech privacy. Finally, we present a concrete example of a specified Scenario of Use and a set of experiments about protecting speaker data against gender inference attacks while maintaining utility for Parkinson's detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Zhu, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) faces significant challenges in achieving true Turing completeness and adaptive, code-driven evolution. Current approaches often generate code independently of its runtime context, relying heavily on the LLM's memory, which results in inefficiencies and limits adaptability. Manual protocol development in sandbox environments further constrains the agent's autonomous adaptability. Crucially, achieving consistency in code and context across multi-turn interactions and ensuring isolation of local variables within each interaction remains an unsolved problem.
  We introduce MOSS (llM-oriented Operating System Simulation), a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating code generation with a dynamic context management system. MOSS ensures consistency and adaptability by using a mechanism that maintains the Python context across interactions, including isolation of local variables and preservation of runtime integrity. At its core, the framework employs an Inversion of Control (IoC) container in conjunction with decorators to enforce the least knowledge principle, allowing agents to focus on abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations. This facilitates seamless integration of new tools and libraries, enables runtime instance replacement, and reduces prompt complexity, providing a "what you see is what you get" environment for the agent.
  Through a series of case studies, we show how this framework can enhance the efficiency and capabilities of agent development and highlight its advantages in moving towards Turing-complete agents capable of evolving through code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Ma, Mengyin Liu, Chao Zhu, Xu-Cheng Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large Multi-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large number of parameters. Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained category rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or materials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes. However, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich attribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text feature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without highlighting them. Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit approach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level detection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit linear space. Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within the input text as a zero-shot prompted task. Secondly, by strategically adjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global text and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as two vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for detection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to reweight both two vectors. Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred among different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear composition is universal. Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset demonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained attribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Hamilton, Simon Stent, Vasha DuTell, Anne Harrington, Jennifer Corbett, Ruth Rosenholtz, William T. Freeman</p>
<p>Abstract: The human visual system is well-tuned to detect faces of all shapes and sizes. While this brings obvious survival advantages, such as a better chance of spotting unknown predators in the bush, it also leads to spurious face detections. ``Face pareidolia'' describes the perception of face-like structure among otherwise random stimuli: seeing faces in coffee stains or clouds in the sky. In this paper, we study face pareidolia from a computer vision perspective. We present an image dataset of ``Faces in Things'', consisting of five thousand web images with human-annotated pareidolic faces. Using this dataset, we examine the extent to which a state-of-the-art human face detector exhibits pareidolia, and find a significant behavioral gap between humans and machines. We find that the evolutionary need for humans to detect animal faces, as well as human faces, may explain some of this gap. Finally, we propose a simple statistical model of pareidolia in images. Through studies on human subjects and our pareidolic face detectors we confirm a key prediction of our model regarding what image conditions are most likely to induce pareidolia.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Zhao, Tao Shen, Didi Zhu, Zexi Li, Jing Su, Xuwu Wang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and widespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$. Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has expanded their cyber-attack surface, introducing new and sophisticated threats with potential to exploit emerging vulnerabilities. Assessing the risks of CPSs is increasingly difficult due to incomplete and outdated cybersecurity knowledge. This highlights the urgent need for better-informed risk assessments and mitigation strategies. While previous efforts have relied on rule-based natural language processing (NLP) tools to map vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a unique opportunity to enhance cyber-attack knowledge completion through improved reasoning, inference, and summarization capabilities. We apply embedding models to encapsulate information on attack patterns and adversarial techniques, generating mappings between them using vector embeddings. Additionally, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approach that leverages pre-trained models to create structured mappings between different taxonomies of threat patterns. Further, we use a small hand-labeled dataset to compare the proposed RAG-based approach to a baseline standard binary classification model. Thus, the proposed approach provides a comprehensive framework to address the challenge of cyber-attack knowledge graph completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aldo Pacchiano</p>
<p>Abstract: Many works have developed algorithms no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with function approximation, where the mean rewards over context-action pairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this problem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on the optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the regret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder dimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the logarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is changing and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares algorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the square root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the measurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function approximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing techniques for deriving second order bounds in contextual linear problems.</p>

Leveraging deep learning, FEIM-TTS transcends traditional TTS systems by interpreting facial cues and adjusting to emotional nuances without dependence on labeled datasets.

FEIM-TTS's unique capability to produce high-quality, speaker-agnostic speech makes it suitable for creating adaptable voices for virtual characters. Moreover, FEIM-TTS significantly enhances accessibility for individuals with visual impairments or those who have trouble seeing. By integrating emotional nuances into TTS, our model enables dynamic and engaging auditory experiences for webcomics, allowing visually impaired users to enjoy these narratives more fully. Comprehensive evaluation evidences its proficiency in modulating emotion and intensity, advancing emotional speech synthesis and accessibility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matheus Camilo da Silva, Gabriel Marques Tavares, Eric Medvet, Sylvio Barbon Junior</p>
<p>Abstract: The Problem-oriented AutoML in Clustering (PoAC) framework introduces a novel, flexible approach to automating clustering tasks by addressing the shortcomings of traditional AutoML solutions. Conventional methods often rely on predefined internal Clustering Validity Indexes (CVIs) and static meta-features, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness across diverse clustering tasks. In contrast, PoAC establishes a dynamic connection between the clustering problem, CVIs, and meta-features, allowing users to customize these components based on the specific context and goals of their task. At its core, PoAC employs a surrogate model trained on a large meta-knowledge base of previous clustering datasets and solutions, enabling it to infer the quality of new clustering pipelines and synthesize optimal solutions for unseen datasets. Unlike many AutoML frameworks that are constrained by fixed evaluation metrics and algorithm sets, PoAC is algorithm-agnostic, adapting seamlessly to different clustering problems without requiring additional data or retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that PoAC not only outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks on a variety of datasets but also excels in specific tasks such as data visualization, and highlight its ability to dynamically adjust pipeline configurations based on dataset complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Mussa, Omer Rana, Beno\^it Goossens, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, Charith Perera</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, their potential for enriching information systems in extracting and exploring Linked Data (LD) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestores has not been extensively explored. This paper examines the integration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model retraining. Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as general-purpose extraction tools. Our approach addresses this limitation by incorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing their ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method improves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional chatbots. This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware interaction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often encountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints. The evaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system expressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a promising direction for future research in this area. This investigation not only underscores the versatility of LLMs in enhancing existing information systems but also sets the stage for further explorations into their potential applications within more specialised domains of web information systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, ''What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?'' To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning! {What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.

<p>Abstract: The paper proposes a novel approach of survival transformers and extreme gradient boosting models in predicting cognitive deterioration in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using metabolomics data in the ADNI cohort. By leveraging advanced machine learning and transformer-based techniques applied in survival analysis, the proposed approach highlights the potential of these techniques for more accurate early detection and intervention in Alzheimer's dementia disease. This research also underscores the importance of non-invasive biomarkers and innovative modelling tools in enhancing the accuracy of dementia risk assessments, offering new avenues for clinical practice and patient care. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation procedure consisting of 100 repetitions of a nested cross-validation in which models were trained and evaluated, indicates that the survival machine learning models based on Transformer and XGBoost achieved the highest mean C-index performances, namely 0.85 and 0.8, respectively, and that they are superior to the conventional survival analysis Cox Proportional Hazards model which achieved a mean C-Index of 0.77. Moreover, based on the standard deviations of the C-Index performances obtained in the Monte Carlo simulation, we established that both survival machine learning models above are more stable than the conventional statistical model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional dataset distillation primarily focuses on image representation while often overlooking the important role of labels. In this study, we introduce Label-Augmented Dataset Distillation (LADD), a new dataset distillation framework enhancing dataset distillation with label augmentations. LADD sub-samples each synthetic image, generating additional dense labels to capture rich semantics. These dense labels require only a 2.5% increase in storage (ImageNet subsets) with significant performance benefits, providing strong learning signals. Our label generation strategy can complement existing dataset distillation methods for significantly enhancing their training efficiency and performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LADD outperforms existing methods in terms of computational overhead and accuracy. With three high-performance dataset distillation algorithms, LADD achieves remarkable gains by an average of 14.9% in accuracy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method is proven across various datasets, distillation hyperparameters, and algorithms. Finally, our method improves the cross-architecture robustness of the distilled dataset, which is important in the application scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Kerner, Snehal Chaudhari, Aninda Ghosh, Caleb Robinson, Adeel Ahmad, Eddie Choi, Nathan Jacobs, Chris Holmes, Matthias Mohr, Rahul Dodhia, Juan M. Lavista Ferres, Jennifer Marcus</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop field boundaries are foundational datasets for agricultural monitoring and assessments but are expensive to collect manually. Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Tianxing Chen, Qiaojun Yu, Tianling Xu, Zanxin Chen, Yiting Fu, Cewu Lu, Yao Mu, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated object manipulation requires precise object interaction, where the object's axis must be carefully considered. Previous research employed interactive perception for manipulating articulated objects, but typically, open-loop approaches often suffer from overlooking the interaction dynamics. To address this limitation, we present a closed-loop pipeline integrating interactive perception with online axis estimation from segmented 3D point clouds. Our method leverages any interactive perception technique as a foundation for interactive perception, inducing slight object movement to generate point cloud frames of the evolving dynamic scene. These point clouds are then segmented using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), after which the moving part of the object is masked for accurate motion online axis estimation, guiding subsequent robotic actions. Our approach significantly enhances the precision and efficiency of manipulation tasks involving articulated objects. Experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches, especially in tasks that demand precise axis-based control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Wu, Haisheng Zheng, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable proficiency in general natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instruction tuning, a successful paradigm, enhances the ability of LLMs to follow natural language instructions and exhibit robust generalization across general tasks. However, these models often encounter performance limitations across multiple tasks due to constrained model capacity. Expanding this capacity during the instruction tuning phase poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce parameter-efficient sparsity crafting (PESC), which crafts dense models into sparse models using the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. PESC integrates adapters into the MoE layers of sparse models, differentiating experts without altering the individual weights within these layers. This method significantly reduces computational costs and GPU memory requirements, facilitating model capacity expansion through a minimal parameter increase when guaranteeing the quality of approximation in function space compared to original sparse upcycling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the PESC method. Using PESC during instruction tuning, our best sparse model outperforms other sparse and dense models and exhibits superior general capabilities compared to GPT-3.5.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eli Ben-Michael, D. James Greiner, Melody Huang, Kosuke Imai, Zhichao Jiang, Sooahn Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more generally data-driven algorithms, has become ubiquitous in today's society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a new methodological framework to experimentally answer this question without additional assumptions. We measure a decision maker's ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded experimental design, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is randomized across cases with humans making final decisions. Under this experimental design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems -- human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. We also show when to provide a human-decision maker with AI recommendations and when they should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to the data from our own randomized controlled trial of a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge's decision to impose cash bail. Our analysis also shows that the risk assessment-alone decisions generally perform worse than human decisions with or without algorithmic assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Yang, Wenhui Wang, Tao Qi, Peng Zhang, Tianyun Zhang, Ru Zhang, Jianyi Liu, Yongfeng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately recommending candidate news articles to users has always been the core challenge of news recommendation system. News recommendations often require modeling of user interest to match candidate news. Recent efforts have primarily focused on extracting local subgraph information in a global click graph constructed by the clicked news sequence of all users. Howerer, the computational complexity of extracting global click graph information has hindered the ability to utilize far-reaching linkage which is hidden between two distant nodes in global click graph collaboratively among similar users. To overcome the problem above, we propose a Global-view Long Chain Interests Modeling for news recommendation (GLoCIM), which combines neighbor interest with long chain interest distilled from a global click graph, leveraging the collaboration among similar users to enhance news recommendation. We therefore design a long chain selection algorithm and long chain interest encoder to obtain global-view long chain interest from the global click graph. We design a gated network to integrate long chain interest with neighbor interest to achieve the collaborative interest among similar users. Subsequently we aggregate it with local news category-enhanced representation to generate final user representation. Then candidate news representation can be formed to match user representation to achieve news recommendation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method to improve the performance of news recommendation.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07638">Can We Count on LLMs? The Fixed-Effect Fallacy and Claims of GPT-4 Capabilities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Ball, Shuo Chen, Cormac Herley</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we explore evaluation of LLM capabilities. We present measurements of GPT-4 performance on several deterministic tasks; each task involves a basic calculation and takes as input parameter some element drawn from a large well-defined population (e.g., count elements in a list, multiply two k-digit numbers, etc). We examine several conditions per-task and perform enough trials so that statistically significant differences can be detected. This allows us to investigate the sensitivity of task-accuracy both to query phrasing and input parameter population. We find that seemingly trivial modifications in the task-prompt or input population can yield differences far larger than can be explained by sampling effects. For example, performance on a simple list-counting task varies with query-phrasing and list-length, but also with list composition (i.e., the thing-to-be-counted) and object frequency (e.g., success when an element accounts for $\approx$ 50\% of a list is different from when it accounts for $\approx$ 70\% etc).
  We conclude that efforts to quantify LLM capabilities easily succumb to the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, where experimental observations are improperly generalized beyond what the data supports. A consequence appears to be that intuitions that have been formed based on interactions with humans form a very unreliable guide as to which input modifications should ``make no difference'' to LLM performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, Shiyi Wang, Wenqing Zhong, Nianchen Shen, Yunqi Li, Siqi Wang, Zhiheng Li, Cathy Wu, Zhengbing He, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihuang Wen, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem stands out as an attractive NP-complete problem in theoretic computer science and plays a central role in a broad spectrum of computing-related applications. Exploiting and tuning SAT solvers under numerous scenarios require massive high-quality industry-level SAT instances, which unfortunately are quite limited in the real world. To address the data insufficiency issue, in this paper, we propose W2SAT, a framework to generate SAT formulas by learning intrinsic structures and properties from given real-world/industrial instances in an implicit fashion. To this end, we introduce a novel SAT representation called Weighted Literal Incidence Graph (WLIG), which exhibits strong representation ability and generalizability against existing counterparts, and can be efficiently generated via a specialized learning-based graph generative model. Decoding from WLIGs into SAT problems is then modeled as finding overlapping cliques with a novel hill-climbing optimization method termed Optimal Weight Coverage (OWC). Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our WLIG-induced approach in terms of graph metrics, efficiency, and scalability in comparison to previous methods. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of graph-based SAT generation for real-world applications, especially when utilizing generated instances for SAT solver parameter-tuning, and pose some potential directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiye Zhao, Yifan Sun, Feihan Li, Rui Chen, Ruixuan Liu, Tianhao Wei, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the trial-and-error nature, it is typically challenging to apply RL algorithms to safety-critical real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, human-robot interaction, robot manipulation, etc, where such errors are not tolerable. Recently, safe RL (i.e. constrained RL) has emerged rapidly in the literature, in which the agents explore the environment while satisfying constraints. Due to the diversity of algorithms and tasks, it remains difficult to compare existing safe RL algorithms. To fill that gap, we introduce GUARD, a Generalized Unified SAfe Reinforcement Learning Development Benchmark. GUARD has several advantages compared to existing benchmarks. First, GUARD is a generalized benchmark with a wide variety of RL agents, tasks, and safety constraint specifications. Second, GUARD comprehensively covers state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms with self-contained implementations. Third, GUARD is highly customizable in tasks and algorithms. We present a comparison of state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms in various task settings using GUARD and establish baselines that future work can build on.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ferdous Alam, Yi Wang, Chin-Yi Cheng, Jieliang Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Volumetric design, also called massing design, is the first and critical step in professional building design which is sequential in nature. As the volumetric design process requires careful design decisions and iterative adjustments, the underlying sequential design process encodes valuable information for designers. Many efforts have been made to automatically generate reasonable volumetric designs, but the quality of the generated design solutions varies, and evaluating a design solution requires either a prohibitively comprehensive set of metrics or expensive human expertise. While previous approaches focused on learning only the final design instead of sequential design tasks, we propose to encode the design knowledge from a collection of expert or high-performing design sequences and extract useful representations using transformer-based models. Later we propose to utilize the learned representations for crucial downstream applications such as design preference evaluation and procedural design generation. We develop the preference model by estimating the density of the learned representations whereas we train an autoregressive transformer model for sequential design generation. We demonstrate our ideas by leveraging a novel dataset of thousands of sequential volumetric designs. Our preference model can compare two arbitrarily given design sequences and is almost $90\%$ accurate in evaluation against random design sequences. Our autoregressive model is also capable of autocompleting a volumetric design sequence from a partial design sequence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Employers are adopting algorithmic hiring technology throughout the recruitment pipeline. Algorithmic fairness is especially applicable in this domain due to its high stakes and structural inequalities. Unfortunately, most work in this space provides partial treatment, often constrained by two competing narratives, optimistically focused on replacing biased recruiter decisions or pessimistically pointing to the automation of discrimination. Whether, and more importantly what types of, algorithmic hiring can be less biased and more beneficial to society than low-tech alternatives currently remains unanswered, to the detriment of trustworthiness. This multidisciplinary survey caters to practitioners and researchers with a balanced and integrated coverage of systems, biases, measures, mitigation strategies, datasets, and legal aspects of algorithmic hiring and fairness. Our work supports a contextualized understanding and governance of this technology by highlighting current opportunities and limitations, providing recommendations for future work to ensure shared benefits for all stakeholders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Farhan Ishmam, Md Sakib Hossain Shovon, M. F. Mridha, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: The multimodal task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) encompassing elements of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to generate answers to questions on any visual input. Over time, the scope of VQA has expanded from datasets focusing on an extensive collection of natural images to datasets featuring synthetic images, video, 3D environments, and various other visual inputs. The emergence of large pre-trained networks has shifted the early VQA approaches relying on feature extraction and fusion schemes to vision language pre-training (VLP) techniques. However, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that encompass both traditional VQA architectures and contemporary VLP-based methods. Furthermore, the VLP challenges in the lens of VQA haven't been thoroughly explored, leaving room for potential open problems to emerge. Our work presents a survey in the domain of VQA that delves into the intricacies of VQA datasets and methods over the field's history, introduces a detailed taxonomy to categorize the facets of VQA, and highlights the recent trends, challenges, and scopes for improvement. We further generalize VQA to multimodal question answering, explore tasks related to VQA, and present a set of open problems for future investigation. The work aims to navigate both beginners and experts by shedding light on the potential avenues of research and expanding the boundaries of the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernhard Jaeger, Andreas Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a deep neural network to maximize a target objective has become the standard recipe for successful machine learning over the last decade. These networks can be optimized with supervised learning, if the target objective is differentiable. For many interesting problems, this is however not the case. Common objectives like intersection over union (IoU), bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score or rewards cannot be optimized with supervised learning. A common workaround is to define differentiable surrogate losses, leading to suboptimal solutions with respect to the actual objective. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising alternative for optimizing deep neural networks to maximize non-differentiable objectives in recent years. Examples include aligning large language models via human feedback, code generation, object detection or control problems. This makes RL techniques relevant to the larger machine learning audience. The subject is, however, time intensive to approach due to the large range of methods, as well as the often very theoretical presentation. In this introduction, we take an alternative approach, different from classic reinforcement learning textbooks. Rather than focusing on tabular problems, we introduce reinforcement learning as a generalization of supervised learning, which we first apply to non-differentiable objectives and later to temporal problems. Assuming only basic knowledge of supervised learning, the reader will be able to understand state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms like proximal policy optimization (PPO) after reading this tutorial.</p>

Towards the task, we develop CogBench, a novel benchmark to assess the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and validate it through participant surveys. We also design two evaluation metrics for CogBench, including Authenticity and Rationality. Recognizing the inherent static nature of LLMs, we introduce CogGPT for the task, which features an innovative iterative cognitive mechanism aimed at enhancing lifelong cognitive dynamics. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CogGPT over existing methods, particularly in its ability to facilitate role-specific cognitive dynamics under continuous information flows.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents. In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data. In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks. The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks. Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Izadi, Mehran Safayani, Abdolreza Mirzaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only 3% of network parameters.</p>

This method elevates the quality of responses and reduces the frequency of hallucinations, where the model generates incorrect or misleading information.

In response to these emerging challenges, we present HiQA, an advanced multi-document question-answering (MDQA) framework that integrates cascading metadata into content and a multi-route retrieval mechanism. We also release a benchmark called MasQA to evaluate and research in MDQA. Finally, HiQA demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in multi-document environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhartha Dalal, Vishal Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Bayesian learning model to explain the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on their core optimization metric of next token prediction. We develop a theoretical framework based on an ideal generative text model represented by a multinomial transition probability matrix with a prior, and examine how LLMs approximate this matrix. Key contributions include: (i) a continuity theorem relating embeddings to multinomial distributions, (ii) a demonstration that LLM text generation aligns with Bayesian learning principles, (iii) an explanation for the emergence of in-context learning in larger models, (iv) empirical validation using visualizations of next token probabilities from an instrumented Llama model Our findings provide new insights into LLM functioning, offering a statistical foundation for understanding their capabilities and limitations. This framework has implications for LLM design, training, and application, potentially guiding future developments in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Zhang, Daijiao Liu, Hexin Liu, Qiquan Zhang, Hanyu Meng, Leibny Paola Garcia, Eng Siong Chng, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have attained leading performances across a diverse range of generative tasks. However, in the field of speech synthesis, although DDPMs exhibit impressive performance, their long training duration and substantial inference costs hinder practical deployment. Existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing inference speed, while approaches to accelerate training a key factor in the costs associated with adding or customizing voices often necessitate complex modifications to the model, compromising their universal applicability. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an inquiry: is it possible to enhance the training/inference speed and performance of DDPMs by modifying the speech signal itself? In this paper, we double the training and inference speed of Speech DDPMs by simply redirecting the generative target to the wavelet domain. This method not only achieves comparable or superior performance to the original model in speech synthesis tasks but also demonstrates its versatility. By investigating and utilizing different wavelet bases, our approach proves effective not just in speech synthesis, but also in speech enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Zhang, Hexin Liu, Kaishuai Xu, Qiquan Zhang, Daijiao Liu, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression is a critical concern in global mental health, prompting extensive research into AI-based detection methods. Among various AI technologies, Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out for their versatility in mental healthcare applications. However, their primary limitation arises from their exclusive dependence on textual input, which constrains their overall capabilities. Furthermore, the utilization of LLMs in identifying and analyzing depressive states is still relatively untapped. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to integrating acoustic speech information into the LLMs framework for multimodal depression detection. We investigate an efficient method for depression detection by integrating speech signals into LLMs utilizing Acoustic Landmarks. By incorporating acoustic landmarks, which are specific to the pronunciation of spoken words, our method adds critical dimensions to text transcripts. This integration also provides insights into the unique speech patterns of individuals, revealing the potential mental states of individuals. Evaluations of the proposed approach on the DAIC-WOZ dataset reveal state-of-the-art results when compared with existing Audio-Text baselines. In addition, this approach is not only valuable for the detection of depression but also represents a new perspective in enhancing the ability of LLMs to comprehend and process speech signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghao Xia, Ben Kao, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph learning has become indispensable for interpreting and harnessing relational data in diverse fields, ranging from recommendation systems to social network analysis. In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunpeng Qing, Shunyu liu, Jingyuan Cong, Kaixuan Chen, Yihe Zhou, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning endeavors to leverage offline datasets to craft effective agent policy without online interaction, which imposes proper conservative constraints with the support of behavior policies to tackle the out-of-distribution problem. However, existing works often suffer from the constraint conflict issue when offline datasets are collected from multiple behavior policies, i.e., different behavior policies may exhibit inconsistent actions with distinct returns across the state space. To remedy this issue, recent advantage-weighted methods prioritize samples with high advantage values for agent training while inevitably ignoring the diversity of behavior policy. In this paper, we introduce a novel Advantage-Aware Policy Optimization (A2PO) method to explicitly construct advantage-aware policy constraints for offline learning under mixed-quality datasets. Specifically, A2PO employs a conditional variational auto-encoder to disentangle the action distributions of intertwined behavior policies by modeling the advantage values of all training data as conditional variables. Then the agent can follow such disentangled action distribution constraints to optimize the advantage-aware policy towards high advantage values. Extensive experiments conducted on both the single-quality and mixed-quality datasets of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that A2PO yields results superior to the counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingren Liu, Zhong Ji, Yanwei Pang, YunLong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methodologies has highlighted the critical challenge of maintaining robust anti-amnesia capabilities in FSCIL learners. In this paper, we present a novel conceptualization of anti-amnesia in terms of mathematical generalization, leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) perspective. Our method focuses on two key aspects: ensuring optimal NTK convergence and minimizing NTK-related generalization loss, which serve as the theoretical foundation for cross-task generalization. To achieve global NTK convergence, we introduce a principled meta-learning mechanism that guides optimization within an expanded network architecture. Concurrently, to reduce the NTK-related generalization loss, we systematically optimize its constituent factors. Specifically, we initiate self-supervised pre-training on the base session to enhance NTK-related generalization potential. These self-supervised weights are then carefully refined through curricular alignment, followed by the application of dual NTK regularization tailored specifically for both convolutional and linear layers. Through the combined effects of these measures, our network acquires robust NTK properties, ensuring optimal convergence and stability of the NTK matrix and minimizing the NTK-related generalization loss, significantly enhancing its theoretical generalization. On popular FSCIL benchmark datasets, our NTK-FSCIL surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, elevating end-session accuracy by 2.9\% to 9.3\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyla Levin, Nicolas van Kempen, Emery D. Berger, Stephen N. Freund</p>
<p>Abstract: Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like `why is x null?'. To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded roughly 50,000 times.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833">Great, Now Write an Article About That: The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Russinovich, Ahmed Salem, Ronen Eldan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as jailbreaks, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chong Zhang, Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Chengzhi Liu, Haochen Xue, Xiaobo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) provide a strong foundation for large-scale user-oriented natural language tasks. A large number of users can easily inject adversarial text or instructions through the user interface, thus causing LLMs model security challenges. Although there is currently a large amount of research on prompt injection attacks, most of these black-box attacks use heuristic strategies. It is unclear how these heuristic strategies relate to the success rate of attacks and thus effectively improve model robustness. To solve this problem, we redefine the goal of the attack: to maximize the KL divergence between the conditional probabilities of the clean text and the adversarial text. Furthermore, we prove that maximizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the Mahalanobis distance between the embedded representation $x$ and $x'$ of the clean text and the adversarial text when the conditional probability is a Gaussian distribution and gives a quantitative relationship on $x$ and $x'$. Then we designed a simple and effective goal-guided generative prompt injection strategy (G2PIA) to find an injection text that satisfies specific constraints to achieve the optimal attack effect approximately. It is particularly noteworthy that our attack method is a query-free black-box attack method with low computational cost. Experimental results on seven LLM models and four datasets show the effectiveness of our attack method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juhwan Choi, Jungmin Yun, Kyohoon Jin, YoungBin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of the dataset is crucial for ensuring optimal performance and reliability of downstream task models. However, datasets often contain noisy data inadvertently included during the construction process. Numerous attempts have been made to correct this issue through human annotators. However, hiring and managing human annotators is expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, recent studies are exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) for data annotation.
  In this study, we present a case study that extends the application of LLM-based data annotation to enhance the quality of existing datasets through a cleansing strategy. Specifically, we leverage approaches such as chain-of-thought and majority voting to imitate human annotation and classify unrelated documents from the Multi-News dataset, which is widely used for the multi-document summarization task. Through our proposed cleansing method, we introduce an enhanced Multi-News+. By employing LLMs for data cleansing, we demonstrate an efficient and effective approach to improving dataset quality without relying on expensive human annotation efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincenzo Auletta, Diodato Ferraioli, Cosimo Vinci</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the Stochastic Budgeted Multi-round Submodular Maximization (SBMSm) problem, where we aim to adaptively maximize the sum, over multiple rounds, of a monotone and submodular objective function defined on subsets of items. The objective function also depends on the realization of stochastic events, and the total number of items we can select over all rounds is bounded by a limited budget. This problem extends, and generalizes to multiple round settings, well-studied problems such as (adaptive) influence maximization and stochastic probing.
  We show that, if the number of items and stochastic events is somehow bounded, there is a polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for SBMSm. Then, we provide a simple greedy $1/2(1-1/e-\epsilon)\approx 0.316$-approximation algorithm for SBMSm, that first non-adaptively allocates the budget to be spent at each round, and then greedily and adaptively maximizes the objective function by using the budget assigned at each round. Finally, we introduce the {\em budget-adaptivity gap}, by which we measure how much an adaptive policy for SBMSm is better than an optimal partially adaptive one that, as in our greedy algorithm, determines the budget allocation in advance. We show that the budget-adaptivity gap lies between $e/(e-1)\approx 1.582$ and $2$.</p>

<p>Abstract: With generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), continuing to make inroads in healthcare, it is critical to supplement traditional automated evaluations with human evaluations. Understanding and evaluating the output of LLMs is essential to assuring safety, reliability, and effectiveness. However, human evaluation's cumbersome, time-consuming, and non-standardized nature presents significant obstacles to comprehensive evaluation and widespread adoption of LLMs in practice. This study reviews existing literature on human evaluation methodologies for LLMs in healthcare. We highlight a notable need for a standardized and consistent human evaluation approach. Our extensive literature search, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, includes publications from January 2018 to February 2024. The review examines the human evaluation of LLMs across various medical specialties, addressing factors such as evaluation dimensions, sample types and sizes, selection, and recruitment of evaluators, frameworks and metrics, evaluation process, and statistical analysis type. Drawing on the diverse evaluation strategies employed in these studies, we propose a comprehensive and practical framework for human evaluation of LLMs: QUEST: Quality of Information, Understanding and Reasoning, Expression Style and Persona, Safety and Harm, and Trust and Confidence. This framework aims to improve the reliability, generalizability, and applicability of human evaluation of LLMs in different healthcare applications by defining clear evaluation dimensions and offering detailed guidelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianxiang Zhan, Yuanpeng He, Yong Deng, Zhen Li, Wenjie Du, Qingsong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous intersection management (AIM) poses significant challenges due to the intricate nature of real-world traffic scenarios and the need for a highly expensive centralised server in charge of simultaneously controlling all the vehicles. This study addresses such issues by proposing a novel distributed approach to AIM utilizing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that by leveraging the 3D surround view technology for advanced assistance systems, autonomous vehicles can accurately navigate intersection scenarios without needing any centralised controller. The contributions of this paper thus include a MARL-based algorithm for the autonomous management of a 4-way intersection and also the introduction of a new strategy called prioritised scenario replay for improved training efficacy. We validate our approach as an innovative alternative to conventional centralised AIM techniques, ensuring the full reproducibility of our results. Specifically, experiments conducted in virtual environments using the SMARTS platform highlight its superiority over benchmarks across various metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Veeti Ahvonen, Damian Heiman, Antti Kuusisto, Carsten Lutz</p>
<p>Abstract: In pioneering work from 2019, Barcel\'o and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models, initially pre-trained with a limited context length, can better handle longer texts by continuing training on a corpus with extended contexts. However, obtaining effective long-context data is challenging due to the scarcity and uneven distribution of long documents across different domains. To address this issue, we propose a Query-centric data synthesis method, abbreviated as Quest. Quest is an interpretable method based on the observation that documents retrieved by similar queries are relevant but low-redundant, thus well-suited for synthesizing long-context data. The method is also scalable and capable of constructing large amounts of long-context data. Using Quest, we synthesize a long-context dataset up to 128k context length, significantly outperforming other data synthesis methods on multiple long-context benchmark datasets. In addition, we further verify that the Quest method is predictable through scaling law experiments, making it a reliable solution for advancing long-context models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fazel Arasteh, Mohammed Elmahgiubi, Behzad Khamidehi, Hamidreza Mirkhani, Weize Zhang, Cao Tongtong, Kasra Rezaee</p>
<p>Abstract: The planning problem constitutes a fundamental aspect of the autonomous driving framework. Recent strides in representation learning have empowered vehicles to comprehend their surrounding environments, thereby facilitating the integration of learning-based planning strategies. Among these approaches, Imitation Learning stands out due to its notable training efficiency. However, traditional Imitation Learning methodologies encounter challenges associated with the co-variate shift phenomenon. We propose Validity Learning on Failures, VL(on failure), as a remedy to address this issue. The essence of our method lies in deploying a pre-trained planner across diverse scenarios. Instances where the planner deviates from its immediate objectives, such as maintaining a safe distance from obstacles or adhering to traffic rules, are flagged as failures. The states corresponding to these failures are compiled into a new dataset, termed the failure dataset. Notably, the absence of expert annotations for this data precludes the applicability of standard imitation learning approaches. To facilitate learning from the closed-loop mistakes, we introduce the VL objective which aims to discern valid trajectories within the current environmental context. Experimental evaluations conducted on both reactive CARLA simulation and non-reactive log-replay simulations reveal substantial enhancements in closed-loop metrics such as \textit{Score, Progress}, and Success Rate, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Further evaluations against the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate that VL(on failure) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Rozner, Barak Battash, Lior Wolf, Ofir Lindenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can become outdated over time as they may lack updated world knowledge, leading to factual knowledge errors and gaps. Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to overcome this challenge using weight updates that do not require expensive retraining. We propose treating KE as an LLM alignment problem. Toward this goal, we introduce Knowledge Direct Preference Optimization (KDPO), a variation of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that is more effective for knowledge modifications. Our method is based on an online approach that continually updates the knowledge stored in the model. We use the current knowledge as a negative sample and the new knowledge we want to introduce as a positive sample in a process called DPO. We also use teacher-forcing for negative sample generation and optimize using the positive sample, which helps maintain localized changes. We tested our KE method on various datasets and models, comparing it to several cutting-edge methods, with 100 and 500 sequential edits. Additionally, we conducted an ablation study comparing our method to the standard DPO approach. Our experimental results show that our modified DPO method allows for more refined KE, achieving similar or better performance compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weimin Xiong, Yifan Song, Xiutian Zhao, Wenhao Wu, Xun Wang, Ke Wang, Cheng Li, Wei Peng, Sujian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model agents have exhibited exceptional performance across a range of complex interactive tasks. Recent approaches have utilized tuning with expert trajectories to enhance agent performance, yet they primarily concentrate on outcome rewards, which may lead to errors or suboptimal actions due to the absence of process supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the Iterative step-level Process Refinement (IPR) framework, which provides detailed step-by-step guidance to enhance agent training. Specifically, we adopt the Monte Carlo method to estimate step-level rewards. During each iteration, the agent explores along the expert trajectory and generates new actions. These actions are then evaluated against the corresponding step of expert trajectory using step-level rewards. Such comparison helps identify discrepancies, yielding contrastive action pairs that serve as training data for the agent.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Tseng, Euan McLean, Kellin Pelrine, Tony T. Wang, Adam Gleave</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work found that superhuman Go AIs can be defeated by simple adversarial strategies, especially "cyclic" attacks. In this paper, we study whether adding natural countermeasures can achieve robustness in Go, a favorable domain for robustness since it benefits from incredible average-case capability and a narrow, innately adversarial setting. We test three defenses: adversarial training on hand-constructed positions, iterated adversarial training, and changing the network architecture. We find that though some of these defenses protect against previously discovered attacks, none withstand freshly trained adversaries. Furthermore, most of the reliably effective attacks these adversaries discover are different realizations of the same overall class of cyclic attacks. Our results suggest that building robust AI systems is challenging even with extremely superhuman systems in some of the most tractable settings, and highlight two key gaps: efficient generalization in defenses, and diversity in training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and deceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and hallucination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisanne van Gelderen, Cristian Tejedor-Garc\'ia</p>
<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, frequently presents with early-stage speech impairments. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data. Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current landscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33 scientific works published between January 2020 and March 2024. We discuss their available resources, capabilities, and potential limitations, and issues related to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source material for PD. The DL approaches identified are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL), and deep acoustic feature extraction (DAFE). Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangda Wei, Aayush Gautam, Ruihong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in a wide array of natural language processing tasks. However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale "pre-train and prompt learning" paradigms have demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling broad applications across diverse domains such as question answering, image recognition, and multimodal retrieval. This approach fully leverages the potential of large-scale pre-trained models, reducing downstream data requirements and computational costs while enhancing model applicability across various tasks. Graphs, as versatile data structures that capture relationships between entities, play pivotal roles in fields such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and biological graphs. Despite the success of pre-train and prompt learning paradigms in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), their application in graph domains remains nascent. In graph-structured data, not only do the node and edge features often have disparate distributions, but the topological structures also differ significantly. This diversity in graph data can lead to incompatible patterns or gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream graphs. We aim to bridge this gap by summarizing methods for alleviating these disparities. This includes exploring prompt design methodologies, comparing related techniques, assessing application scenarios and datasets, and identifying unresolved problems and challenges. This survey categorizes over 100 relevant works in this field, summarizing general design principles and the latest applications, including text-attributed graphs, molecules, proteins, and recommendation systems. Through this extensive review, we provide a foundational understanding of graph prompt learning, aiming to impact not only the graph mining community but also the broader Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Chen-Chi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces VoxHakka, a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for Taiwanese Hakka, a critically under-resourced language spoken in Taiwan. Leveraging the YourTTS framework, VoxHakka achieves high naturalness and accuracy and low real-time factor in speech synthesis while supporting six distinct Hakka dialects. This is achieved by training the model with dialect-specific data, allowing for the generation of speaker-aware Hakka speech. To address the scarcity of publicly available Hakka speech corpora, we employed a cost-effective approach utilizing a web scraping pipeline coupled with automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based data cleaning techniques. This process ensured the acquisition of a high-quality, multi-speaker, multi-dialect dataset suitable for TTS training. Subjective listening tests conducted using comparative mean opinion scores (CMOS) demonstrate that VoxHakka significantly outperforms existing publicly available Hakka TTS systems in terms of pronunciation accuracy, tone correctness, and overall naturalness. This work represents a significant advancement in Hakka language technology and provides a valuable resource for language preservation and revitalization efforts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study analyzes the Ames Housing Dataset using CatBoost and LightGBM models to explore feature importance and causal relationships in housing price prediction. We examine the correlation between SHAP values and EconML predictions, achieving high accuracy in price forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takanori Fujiwara, Kostiantyn Kucher, Junpeng Wang, Rafael M. Martins, Andreas Kerren, Anders Ynnerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Research in ML4VIS investigates how to use machine learning (ML) techniques to generate visualizations, and the field is rapidly growing with high societal impact. However, as with any computational pipeline that employs ML processes, ML4VIS approaches are susceptible to a range of ML-specific adversarial attacks. These attacks can manipulate visualization generations, causing analysts to be tricked and their judgments to be impaired. Due to a lack of synthesis from both visualization and ML perspectives, this security aspect is largely overlooked by the current ML4VIS literature. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of ML-aided visualizations from adversarial attacks using a holistic lens of both visualization and ML perspectives. We first identify the attack surface (i.e., attack entry points) that is unique in ML-aided visualizations. We then exemplify five different adversarial attacks. These examples highlight the range of possible attacks when considering the attack surface and multiple different adversary capabilities. Our results show that adversaries can induce various attacks, such as creating arbitrary and deceptive visualizations, by systematically identifying input attributes that are influential in ML inferences. Based on our observations of the attack surface characteristics and the attack examples, we underline the importance of comprehensive studies of security issues and defense mechanisms as a call of urgency for the ML4VIS community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Bini, Marco Sorbi, Stephane Marchand-Maillet</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling data with graph structures. Recently, attention mechanisms have been integrated into GNNs to improve their ability to capture complex patterns. This paper presents the first comprehensive study revealing a critical, unexplored consequence of this integration: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. We introduce a novel method for detecting and analyzing MAs, focusing on edge features in different graph transformer architectures. Our study assesses various GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs based on activation ratio distributions, (3) introducing the Explicit Bias Term (EBT) as a potential countermeasure and exploring it as an adversarial framework to assess models robustness based on the presence or absence of MAs. Our findings highlight the prevalence and impact of attention-induced MAs across different architectures, such as GraphTransformer, GraphiT, and SAN. The study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, model architecture, dataset characteristics, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for developing more robust and reliable graph models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Jia, Youyuan Liu, Zhewen Hu, Jinzhen Wang, Boyuan Zhang, Wei Niu, Junzhou Huang, Stavros Kalafatis, Sian Jin, Miao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations generate massive datasets that pose significant challenges for storage and I/O. While traditional lossy compression techniques can improve performance, balancing compression ratio, data quality, and throughput remains difficult. To address this, we propose NeurLZ, a novel cross-field learning-based and error-controlled compression framework for scientific data. By integrating skipping DNN models, cross-field learning, and error control, our framework aims to substantially enhance lossy compression performance. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We design a lightweight skipping model to provide high-fidelity detail retention, further improving prediction accuracy. (2) We adopt a cross-field learning approach to significantly improve data prediction accuracy, resulting in a substantially improved compression ratio. (3) We develop an error control approach to provide strict error bounds according to user requirements. We evaluated NeurLZ on several real-world HPC application datasets, including Nyx (cosmological simulation), Miranda (large turbulence simulation), and Hurricane (weather simulation). Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 90% relative reduction in bit rate under the same data distortion, compared to the best existing approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Towers, Aleksandra Kalisz, Philippe A. Robert, Alicia Higueruelo, Francesca Vianello, Ming-Han Chloe Tsai, Harrison Steel, Jakob N. Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, David Stevens, Pranay Shah, Wenwen Jiang, Miao Liu, Xu Chen, Robert Kuo, Na Li, Boying Gong, Daniel Lee, Jiabo Hu, Ning Zhang, Bob Kamma</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for AI training data has transformed data annotation into a global industry, but traditional approaches relying on human annotators are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistent quality. We propose the Model-in-the-Loop (MILO) framework, which integrates AI/ML models into the annotation process. Our research introduces a collaborative paradigm that leverages the strengths of both professional human annotators and large language models (LLMs). By employing LLMs as pre-annotation and real-time assistants, and judges on annotator responses, MILO enables effective interaction patterns between human annotators and LLMs. Three empirical studies on multimodal data annotation demonstrate MILO's efficacy in reducing handling time, improving data quality, and enhancing annotator experiences. We also introduce quality rubrics for flexible evaluation and fine-grained feedback on open-ended annotations. The MILO framework has implications for accelerating AI/ML development, reducing reliance on human annotation alone, and promoting better alignment between human and machine values.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of the big data and large language model era, zero-shot personalized rapid customization has emerged as a significant trend. In this report, we introduce Takin AudioLLM, a series of techniques and models, mainly including Takin TTS, Takin VC, and Takin Morphing, specifically designed for audiobook production. These models are capable of zero-shot speech production, generating high-quality speech that is nearly indistinguishable from real human speech and facilitating individuals to customize the speech content according to their own needs. Specifically, we first introduce Takin TTS, a neural codec language model that builds upon an enhanced neural speech codec and a multi-task training framework, capable of generating high-fidelity natural speech in a zero-shot way. For Takin VC, we advocate an effective content and timbre joint modeling approach to improve the speaker similarity, while advocating for a conditional flow matching based decoder to further enhance its naturalness and expressiveness. Last, we propose the Takin Morphing system with highly decoupled and advanced timbre and prosody modeling approaches, which enables individuals to customize speech production with their preferred timbre and prosody in a precise and controllable manner. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our Takin AudioLLM series models. For detailed demos, please refer to https://everest-ai.github.io/takinaudiollm/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the cornerstones of modern artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Juhaina, a Arabic-English bilingual LLM specifically designed to align with the values and preferences of Arabic speakers. Juhaina inherently supports advanced functionalities such as instruction following, open-ended question answering, information provisioning, and text processing. Our model contains 9.24 billion parameters and is trained on a context window of up to 8,192 tokens. This paper details the creation process of Juhaina and provides an extensive empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we identify the limitations of widely-adopted Open Arabic LLM Leaderboard (OALL) and propose a new evaluation benchmark, CamelEval. Our findings demonstrate that Juhaina surpasses existing LLMs of comparable sizes, such as the Llama and Gemma families, in generating helpful responses in Arabic, providing factually accurate information about the region, and understanding nuanced cultural aspects. We aspire for Juhaina to democratize cutting-edge AI technologies, serving over 400 million Arabic speakers by offering LLMs that not only communicate in their language but also comprehend their culture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyue Zhang, Zhiliu Yang, Xinhe Zuo, Yuxin Tong, Ying Long, Chen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale scene reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and aims to address the scalability and accuracy challenges faced by existing methods. For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction. We further validate the generalizability of the proposed approach by rendering on self-collected video clips recorded by a commercial drone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Flavor development in the food industry is increasingly challenged by the need for rapid innovation and precise flavor profile creation. Traditional flavor research methods typically rely on iterative, subjective testing, which lacks the efficiency and scalability required for modern demands. This paper presents three contributions to address the challenges. Firstly, we define a new problem domain for scientific agents in flavor science, conceptualized as the generation of hypotheses for flavor profile sourcing and understanding. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce the FoodPuzzle, a challenging benchmark consisting of 978 food items and 1,766 flavor molecules profiles. We propose a novel Scientific Agent approach, integrating in-context learning and retrieval augmented techniques to generate grounded hypotheses in the domain of food science. Experimental results indicate that our model significantly surpasses traditional methods in flavor profile prediction tasks, demonstrating its potential to transform flavor development practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Resilience refers to the ability of systems to withstand, adapt to, and recover from disruptive events. While studies on resilience have attracted significant attention across various research domains, the precise definition of this concept within the field of cooperative artificial intelligence remains unclear. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a clear definition of `cooperative resilience' and outlining a methodology for its quantitative measurement. The methodology is validated in an environment with RL-based and LLM-augmented autonomous agents, subjected to environmental changes and the introduction of agents with unsustainable behaviors. These events are parameterized to create various scenarios for measuring cooperative resilience. The results highlight the crucial role of resilience metrics in analyzing how the collective system prepares for, resists, recovers from, sustains well-being, and transforms in the face of disruptions. These findings provide foundational insights into the definition, measurement, and preliminary analysis of cooperative resilience, offering significant implications for the broader field of AI. Moreover, the methodology and metrics developed here can be adapted to a wide range of AI applications, enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of AI in dynamic and unpredictable environments.</p>

However, it also has limitations, including the gap between vector similarity and the relevance of knowledge reasoning, as well as insensitivity to knowledge logic, such as numerical values, temporal relations, expert rules, and others, which hinder the effectiveness of professional knowledge services. In this work, we introduce a professional domain knowledge service framework called Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG). KAG is designed to address the aforementioned challenges with the motivation of making full use of the advantages of knowledge graph(KG) and vector retrieval, and to improve generation and reasoning performance by bidirectionally enhancing large language models (LLMs) and KGs through five key aspects: (1) LLM-friendly knowledge representation, (2) mutual-indexing between knowledge graphs and original chunks, (3) logical-form-guided hybrid reasoning engine, (4) knowledge alignment with semantic reasoning, and (5) model capability enhancement for KAG. We compared KAG with existing RAG methods in multihop question answering and found that it significantly outperforms state-of-theart methods, achieving a relative improvement of 19.6% on 2wiki and 33.5% on hotpotQA in terms of F1 score. We have successfully applied KAG to two professional knowledge Q&A tasks of Ant Group, including E-Government Q&A and E-Health Q&A, achieving significant improvement in professionalism compared to RAG methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Slimane Larabi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the gated perceptron, an enhancement of the conventional perceptron, which incorporates an additional input computed as the product of the existing inputs. This allows the perceptron to capture non-linear interactions between features, significantly improving its ability to classify and regress on complex datasets. We explore its application in both linear and non-linear regression tasks using the Iris dataset, as well as binary and multi-class classification problems, including the PIMA Indian dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Our results demonstrate that the gated perceptron can generate more distinct decision regions compared to traditional perceptrons, enhancing its classification capabilities, particularly in handling non-linear data. Performance comparisons show that the gated perceptron competes with state-of-the-art classifiers while maintaining a simple architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarfaroz Yunusov, Hamza Sidat, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating personalized "mirror stories" that reflect and resonate with individual readers' identities, addressing the significant lack of diversity in literature. We present MirrorStories, a corpus of 1,500 personalized short stories generated by integrating elements such as name, gender, age, ethnicity, reader interest, and story moral. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively incorporate diverse identity elements into narratives, with human evaluators identifying personalized elements in the stories with high accuracy. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving 26 diverse human judges, we compare the effectiveness of MirrorStories against generic narratives. We find that personalized LLM-generated stories not only outscore generic human-written and LLM-generated ones across all metrics of engagement (with average ratings of 4.22 versus 3.37 on a 5-point scale), but also achieve higher textual diversity while preserving the intended moral. We also provide analyses that include bias assessments and a study on the potential for integrating images into personalized stories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Wang, Ping Jian, Zhen Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reading comprehension is a challenging task that entails grasping the underlying semantics of text and applying reasoning to deduce the correct answer. Prior researches have primarily focused on enhancing logical reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or data augmentation. However, previous work constructing chain-of-thought rationales concentrates solely on analyzing correct options, neglecting the incorrect alternatives. Addtionally, earlier efforts on data augmentation by altering contexts rely on rule-based methods, which result in generated contexts that lack diversity and coherence. To address these issues, we propose a Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation (PODA) framework. This framework can generate CoT rationales including analyses for both correct and incorrect options, while constructing diverse and high-quality counterfactual contexts from incorrect candidate options. We integrate summarizing premises and identifying premises for each option into rationales. Subsequently, we employ multi-step prompts with identified premises to construct counterfactual context. To facilitate the model's capabilities to better differentiate the reasoning process associated with each option, we introduce a novel thought-path contrastive learning method that compares reasoning paths between the original and counterfactual samples. Experimental results on three representative LLMs demonstrate that our method can improve the baselines substantially across two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks (ReClor and LogiQA 2.0).

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chanin, James Wilken-Smith, Tom\'a\v{s} Dulka, Hardik Bhatnagar, Joseph Bloom</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to decompose the activations of Large Language Models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latents. In this paper, we pose two questions. First, to what extent do SAEs extract monosemantic and interpretable latents? Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dasol Choi, Dongbin Na</p>
<p>Abstract: With the explosive growth of deep learning applications, the right to be forgotten has become increasingly in demand in various AI industries. For example, given a facial recognition system, some individuals may wish to remove images that might have been used in the training phase from the trained model. Unfortunately, modern deep neural networks sometimes unexpectedly leak personal identities. Recent studies have presented various machine unlearning algorithms to make a trained model unlearn the data to be forgotten. While these methods generally perform well in terms of forgetting scores, we have found that an unexpected modelutility drop can occur. This phenomenon, which we term correlation collapse, happens when the machine unlearning algorithms reduce the useful correlation between image features and the true label. To address this challenge, we propose Distribution-Level Feature Distancing (DLFD), a novel method that efficiently forgets instances while preventing correlation collapse. Our method synthesizes data samples so that the generated data distribution is far from the distribution of samples being forgotten in the feature space, achieving effective results within a single training epoch. Through extensive experiments on facial recognition datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine unlearning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Yang, Ruipeng Jia, Naibin Gu, Zheng Lin, Siyuan Chen, Chao Pang, Weichong Yin, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: DPO is an effective preference optimization algorithm. However, the DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on the dispreferred samples, manifested as overly long generations lacking diversity. While recent regularization approaches have endeavored to alleviate this issue by modifying the objective function, they achieved that at the cost of alignment performance degradation. In this paper, we innovatively incorporate regularization from the perspective of weight updating to curb alignment overfitting. Through the pilot experiment, we discovered that there exists a positive correlation between overfitting and the hyperspherical energy fluctuation. Hence, we introduce orthogonal finetuning for DPO via a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which merely conducts rotational and magnitude-stretching updates on the weight parameters to maintain the hyperspherical energy invariant, thereby preserving the knowledge encoded in the angle between neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while retaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable parameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting. Specifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an average of 6 points.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel embedding method diverging from conventional approaches by operating within function spaces of finite dimension rather than finite vector space, thus departing significantly from standard knowledge graph embedding techniques. Initially employing polynomial functions to compute embeddings, we progress to more intricate representations using neural networks with varying layer complexities. We argue that employing functions for embedding computation enhances expressiveness and allows for more degrees of freedom, enabling operations such as composition, derivatives and primitive of entities representation. Additionally, we meticulously outline the step-by-step construction of our approach and provide code for reproducibility, thereby facilitating further exploration and application in the field.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14874">Towards Ground-truth-free Evaluation of Any Segmentation in Medical Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahjol Senbi, Tianyu Huang, Fei Lyu, Qing Li, Yuhui Tao, Wei Shao, Qiang Chen, Chengyan Wang, Shuo Wang, Tao Zhou, Yizhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the feasibility and potential of building a ground-truth-free evaluation model to assess the quality of segmentations generated by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants in medical imaging. This evaluation model estimates segmentation quality scores by analyzing the coherence and consistency between the input images and their corresponding segmentation predictions. Based on prior research, we frame the task of training this model as a regression problem within a supervised learning framework, using Dice scores (and optionally other metrics) along with mean squared error to compute the training loss. The model is trained utilizing a large collection of public datasets of medical images with segmentation predictions from SAM and its variants. We name this model EvanySeg (Evaluation of Any Segmentation in Medical Images). Our exploration of convolution-based models (e.g., ResNet) and transformer-based models (e.g., ViT) suggested that ViT yields better performance for this task. EvanySeg can be employed for various tasks, including: (1) identifying poorly segmented samples by detecting low-percentile segmentation quality scores; (2) benchmarking segmentation models without ground truth by averaging quality scores across test samples; (3) alerting human experts to poor-quality segmentation predictions during human-AI collaboration by applying a threshold within the score space; and (4) selecting the best segmentation prediction for each test sample at test time when multiple segmentation models are available, by choosing the prediction with the highest quality score. Models and code will be made available at https://github.com/ahjolsenbics/EvanySeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minseung Lee, Seokha Moon, Seung Joon Lee, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately detecting objects at long distances remains a critical challenge in 3D object detection when relying solely on LiDAR sensors due to the inherent limitations of data sparsity. To address this issue, we propose the LiDAR-Camera Augmentation Network (LCANet), a novel framework that reconstructs LiDAR point cloud data by fusing 2D image features, which contain rich semantic information, generating additional points to improve detection accuracy. LCANet fuses data from LiDAR sensors and cameras by projecting image features into the 3D space, integrating semantic information into the point cloud data. This fused data is then encoded to produce 3D features that contain both semantic and spatial information, which are further refined to reconstruct final points before bounding box prediction. This fusion effectively compensates for LiDAR's weakness in detecting objects at long distances, which are often represented by sparse points. Additionally, due to the sparsity of many objects in the original dataset, which makes effective supervision for point generation challenging, we employ a point cloud completion network to create a complete point cloud dataset that supervises the generation of dense point clouds in our network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that LCANet significantly outperforms existing models, particularly in detecting sparse and distant objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agniv Sharma, Jonas Geiping</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers are widely used across various applications, many of which yield sparse or partially filled attention matrices. Examples include attention masks designed to reduce the quadratic complexity of attention, sequence packing techniques, and recent innovations like tree masking for fast validation in MEDUSA. Despite the inherent sparsity in these matrices, the state-of-the-art algorithm Flash Attention still processes them with quadratic complexity as though they were dense. In this paper, we introduce Binary Block Masking, a highly efficient modification that enhances Flash Attention by making it mask-aware. We further propose two optimizations: one tailored for masks with contiguous non-zero patterns and another for extremely sparse masks. Our experiments on attention masks derived from real-world scenarios demonstrate up to a 9x runtime improvement. The implementation will be publicly released to foster further research and application.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15228">A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating API-oriented Code Generation in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixi Wu (Peter), Pengfei He (Peter), Zehao Wang (Peter), Shaowei Wang (Peter), Yuan Tian (Peter),  Tse-Hsun (Peter),  Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have emerged as powerful tools for code generation, significantly enhancing productivity and accelerating software development. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation, i.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given the growing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for a systematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented code generation. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight and automated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in API-oriented code generation. Our framework works with any library that provides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendation and code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generated APIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendations for Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API is invoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, we conducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder) and Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Our findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks, with ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar effectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder and DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality, such as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achieve high accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous code examples. Retrieval-augmented generation enhances the quality of code generated by LLMs, though its effectiveness varies across different LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited understanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine inference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1) effectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the interactions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and their impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the large space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated framework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling, multi-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It then transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time techniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this objective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS) algorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and available LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon architectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed inference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of 14.1 and 10.3 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have aimed to integrate and interpret data across diverse modalities. However, the capacity of these models to concurrently process and reason about multiple modalities remains inadequately explored, partly due to the lack of comprehensive modality-wise benchmarks. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is distinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate responses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three modalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) most OLMs exhibit critical limitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baselines models perform poorly (below 50\% accuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images or/and audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent context from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM training paradigms. We advocate for future research to focus on developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance across diverse modalities.
