<p><b>Authors:</b> Joykirat Singh, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Akshay Nambi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities; however, they still struggle with complex multi-step mathematical problem-solving due to error propagation, lack of self-correction, and limited adaptability to diverse reasoning styles. Existing methods rely on static fine-tuning or prompt engineering, which fail to generalize across problem complexities, while the scarcity of high-quality preference data further hinders reliable reasoning.
  We introduce SPHERE, a self-evolving data generation pipeline that enhances reasoning in small language models (SLMs) by iteratively generating, correcting, and diversifying reasoning chains. SPHERE operates in three stages: (i) Self-Generation, where the model autonomously constructs problem-solving steps; (ii) Self-Correction, enabling it to identify and rectify errors; and (iii) Diversity Induction, improving robustness through multiple valid reasoning trajectories. This self-evolution mechanism strengthens mathematical reasoning and enhances model reliability. Evaluations on MATH 500, GSM8K, AIME, AMC, and Olympiad show that SPHERE-trained models achieve significant gains over their base versions and match/surpass GPT-4o on certain benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that self-evolving models can close the reasoning gap between SLMs and state-of-the-art LLMs, making mathematical AI more reliable, scalable, and efficient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhisek Ganguly, Alessandro Gabbana, Vybhav Rao, Sauro Succi, Santosh Ansumali</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a physics-based regularization technique for function learning, inspired by statistical mechanics. By drawing an analogy between optimizing the parameters of an interpolator and minimizing the energy of a system, we introduce corrections that impose constraints on the lower-order moments of the data distribution. This minimizes the discrepancy between the discrete and continuum representations of the data, in turn allowing to access more favorable energy landscapes, thus improving the accuracy of the interpolator. Our approach improves performance in both interpolation and regression tasks, even in high-dimensional spaces. Unlike traditional methods, it does not require empirical parameter tuning, making it particularly effective for handling noisy data. We also show that thanks to its local nature, the method offers computational and memory efficiency advantages over Radial Basis Function interpolators, especially for large datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to radar target detection using Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). Known for their ability to learn complex distributions and identify out-ofdistribution samples, the proposed VAE architecture effectively distinguishes radar targets from various noise types, including correlated Gaussian and compound Gaussian clutter, often combined with additive white Gaussian thermal noise. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed VAE outperforms classical adaptive detectors such as the Matched Filter and the Normalized Matched Filter, especially in challenging noise conditions, highlighting its robustness and adaptability in radar applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04946">Federated Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Changchang Yin, Hong-You Chen, Wei-Lun Chao, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation is to evaluate the causal effects of treatment strategies on some important outcomes, which is a crucial problem in healthcare. Most existing ITE estimation methods are designed for centralized settings. However, in real-world clinical scenarios, the raw data are usually not shareable among hospitals due to the potential privacy and security risks, which makes the methods not applicable. In this work, we study the ITE estimation task in a federated setting, which allows us to harness the decentralized data from multiple hospitals. Due to the unavoidable confounding bias in the collected data, a model directly learned from it would be inaccurate. One well-known solution is Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW), which uses the conditional probability of treatment given the covariates to re-weight each training example. Applying IPTW in a federated setting, however, is non-trivial. We found that even with a well-estimated conditional probability, the local model training step using each hospital's data alone would still suffer from confounding bias. To address this, we propose FED-IPTW, a novel algorithm to extend IPTW into a federated setting that enforces both global (over all the data) and local (within each hospital) decorrelation between covariates and treatments. We validated our approach on the task of comparing the treatment effects of mechanical ventilation on improving survival probability for patients with breadth difficulties in the intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world eICU datasets and the results show that FED-IPTW outperform state-of-the-art methods on all the metrics on factual prediction and ITE estimation tasks, paving the way for personalized treatment strategy design in mechanical ventilation usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ada Defne Tur, Nicholas Meade, Xing Han L\`u, Alejandra Zambrano, Arkil Patel, Esin Durmus, Spandana Gella, Karolina Sta\'nczak, Siva Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly proficient at solving web-based tasks. With this capability comes a greater risk of misuse for malicious purposes, such as posting misinformation in an online forum or selling illicit substances on a website. To evaluate these risks, we propose SafeArena, the first benchmark to focus on the deliberate misuse of web agents. SafeArena comprises 250 safe and 250 harmful tasks across four websites. We classify the harmful tasks into five harm categories -- misinformation, illegal activity, harassment, cybercrime, and social bias, designed to assess realistic misuses of web agents. We evaluate leading LLM-based web agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Qwen-2-VL 72B, and Llama-3.2 90B, on our benchmark. To systematically assess their susceptibility to harmful tasks, we introduce the Agent Risk Assessment framework that categorizes agent behavior across four risk levels. We find agents are surprisingly compliant with malicious requests, with GPT-4o and Qwen-2 completing 34.7% and 27.3% of harmful requests, respectively. Our findings highlight the urgent need for safety alignment procedures for web agents. Our benchmark is available here: https://safearena.github.io</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971">Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyuan Li, Jia Hu, Geyong Min, Haojun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04975">Energy-Weighted Flow Matching for Offline Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyuan Zhang, Weitong Zhang, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates energy guidance in generative modeling, where the target distribution is defined as $q(\mathbf x) \propto p(\mathbf x)\exp(-\beta \mathcal E(\mathbf x))$, with $p(\mathbf x)$ being the data distribution and $\mathcal E(\mathcal x)$ as the energy function. To comply with energy guidance, existing methods often require auxiliary procedures to learn intermediate guidance during the diffusion process. To overcome this limitation, we explore energy-guided flow matching, a generalized form of the diffusion process. We introduce energy-weighted flow matching (EFM), a method that directly learns the energy-guided flow without the need for auxiliary models. Theoretical analysis shows that energy-weighted flow matching accurately captures the guided flow. Additionally, we extend this methodology to energy-weighted diffusion models and apply it to offline reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing the Q-weighted Iterative Policy Optimization (QIPO). Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed QIPO algorithm improves performance in offline RL tasks. Notably, our algorithm is the first energy-guided diffusion model that operates independently of auxiliary models and the first exact energy-guided flow matching model in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal performance impact. However, existing methods often suffer from performance loss without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Further experiments indicate our proposed method is orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, where Wanda++ can be combined with LoRA fine-tuning to achieve a similar perplexity improvement as the Wanda method. The proposed method is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05029">Continual Pre-training of MoEs: How robust is your router?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Th\'erien, Charles-\'Etienne Joseph, Zain Sarwar, Ashwinee Panda, Anirban Das, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Stephen Rawls, Sambit Sahu, Eugene Belilovsky, Irina Rish</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformers are promising architectures for foundation models. Compared to dense transformers that require the same amount of floating point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass, MoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much stronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language models have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will want to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly collected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a simple combination of replay and learning rate re-warming and re-decaying can enable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with minimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of decoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm will impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's routers exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers maintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same strategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE LLMs? In what follows, we conduct a large-scale (>2B parameter switch and DeepSeek MoE LLMs trained for 600B tokens) empirical study across four MoE transformers to answer these questions. Our results establish a surprising robustness to distribution shifts for both Sinkhorn-Balanced and Z-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually pre-trained without replay. Moreover, we show that MoE LLMs maintain their sample efficiency (relative to a FLOP-matched dense model) during CPT and that they can match the performance of a fully re-trained MoE at a fraction of the cost.</p>

However, no theoretical guarantees were given. This work provides a theoretical framework for the automata-conditioned RL problem and shows that it is probably approximately correct learnable. We then present a technique for learning provably correct automata embeddings, guaranteeing optimal multi-task policy learning. Our experimental evaluation confirms these theoretical results.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05066">Capacity-Aware Inference: Mitigating the Straggler Effect in Mixture of Experts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shwai He, Weilin Cai, Jiayi Huang, Ang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) is an effective architecture for scaling large language models by leveraging sparse expert activation, optimizing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, under expert parallelism, MoE suffers from inference inefficiencies due to imbalanced token-to-expert assignment, where some experts are overloaded while others remain underutilized. This imbalance leads to poor resource utilization and increased latency, as the most burdened expert dictates the overall delay, a phenomenon we define as the \textbf{\textit{Straggler Effect}}. To mitigate this, we propose Capacity-Aware Inference, including two key techniques: (1) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Drop}}, which discards overloaded tokens to regulate the maximum latency of MoE, and (2) \textbf{\textit{Capacity-Aware Token Reroute}}, which reallocates overflowed tokens to underutilized experts, balancing the token distribution. These techniques collectively optimize both high-load and low-load expert utilization, leading to a more efficient MoE inference pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, showing significant improvements in inference efficiency, e.g., 0.2\% average performance increase and a 1.94$\times$ inference speedup on Mixtral-8$\times$7B-Instruct.</p>

Building on this connection, we propose DIL, a principled framework that directly optimizes the imitation learning objective.

By bridging IL and RLHF, DIL offers new insights into alignment with RLHF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing methods on various challenging benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: To remedy the drawbacks of full-mass or fixed-mass constraints in classical optimal transport, we propose adaptive optimal transport which is distinctive from the classical optimal transport in its ability of adaptive-mass preserving. It aims to answer the mathematical problem of how to transport the probability mass adaptively between probability distributions, which is a fundamental topic in various areas of artificial intelligence. Adaptive optimal transport is able to transfer mass adaptively in the light of the intrinsic structure of the problem itself. The theoretical results shed light on the adaptive mechanism of mass transportation. Furthermore, we instantiate the adaptive optimal transport in machine learning application to align source and target distributions partially and adaptively by respecting the ubiquity of noises, outliers, and distribution shifts in the data. The experiment results on the domain adaptation benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruinan Wang, Ian Nabney, Mohammad Golbabaee</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a critical component of machine learning pipelines, significantly affecting model robustness, stability, and generalization. However, HPO is often a time-consuming and computationally intensive task. Traditional HPO methods, such as grid search and random search, often suffer from inefficiency. Bayesian optimization, while more efficient, still struggles with high-dimensional search spaces. In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring how insights gained from hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can be leveraged to accelerate HPO, reducing both time and computational resources. Building on prior work that quantified hyperparameter importance by evaluating 10 hyperparameters on CNNs using 10 common image classification datasets, we implement a novel HPO strategy called 'Sequential Grouping.' That prior work assessed the importance weights of the investigated hyperparameters based on their influence on model performance, providing valuable insights that we leverage to optimize our HPO process. Our experiments, validated across six additional image classification datasets, demonstrate that incorporating hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can significantly accelerate HPO without compromising model performance, reducing optimization time by an average of 31.9\% compared to the conventional simultaneous strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibo Feng, Wanjin Feng, Xingyu Gao, Peilin Zhao, Zhiqi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising, biologically inspired approach for processing spatiotemporal data, particularly for time series forecasting. However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Gao, Zhuo Deng, Zheng Gong, Ziyi Jiang, Lan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Insulin resistance (IR) is a key precursor to diabetes and a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Traditional IR assessment methods require multiple blood tests. We developed a simple AI model using only fasting blood glucose to predict IR in non-diabetic populations. Data from the NHANES (1999-2020) and CHARLS (2015) studies were used for model training and validation. Input features included age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference, and fasting blood glucose. The CatBoost algorithm achieved AUC values of 0.8596 (HOMA-IR) and 0.7777 (TyG index) in NHANES, with an external AUC of 0.7442 for TyG. For METS-IR prediction, the model achieved AUC values of 0.9731 (internal) and 0.9591 (external), with RMSE values of 3.2643 (internal) and 3.057 (external). SHAP analysis highlighted waist circumference as a key predictor of IR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reginald McLean, Evangelos Chataroulas, Jordan Terry, Isaac Woungang, Nariman Farsad, Pablo Samuel Castro</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this technical report, we tackle the challenges of training large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on overcoming cost inefficiency and resource limitations prevalent in such systems. To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhan Zheng, Huyu Wu, Haopeng Jin, Ruotai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy in disease treatment and healthcare through personalized herb prescriptions. However, current herb recommendation models inadequately capture the multiscale relations between herbs and clinical symptoms, particularly neglecting latent correlations at the chemical-molecular scale. To address these limitations, we propose the Fusion of Multiscale Correlations of Herbs and Symptoms (FMCHS), an innovative framework that synergistically integrates molecular-scale chemical characteristics of herbs with clinical symptoms. The framework employs multi-relational graph transformer layers to generate enriched embeddings that preserve both structural and semantic features within herbs and symptoms. Through systematic incorporation of herb chemical profiles into node embeddings and implementation of attention-based feature fusion, FMCHS effectively utilizes multiscale correlations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate FMCHS's superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline, achieving relative improvements of 8.85% in Precision@5, 12.30% in Recall@5, and 10.86% in F1@5 compared to the SOTA model on benchmark datasets. This work facilitates the practical application of TCM in disease treatment and healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juniper Tyree, Andreas Rupp, Petri S. Clusius, Michael H. Boy</p>
<p>Abstract: Applying machine learning to increasingly high-dimensional problems with sparse or biased training data increases the risk that a model is used on inputs outside its training domain. For such out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, the model can no longer make valid predictions, and its error is potentially unbounded.
  Testing OOD detection methods on real-world datasets is complicated by the ambiguity around which inputs are in-distribution (ID) or OOD. We design a benchmark for OOD detection, which includes three novel and easily-visualisable toy examples. These simple examples provide direct and intuitive insight into whether the detector is able to detect (1) linear and (2) non-linear concepts and (3) identify thin ID subspaces (needles) within high-dimensional spaces (haystacks). We use our benchmark to evaluate the performance of various methods from the literature.
  Since tactile examples of OOD inputs may benefit OOD detection, we also review several simple methods to synthesise OOD inputs for supervised training. We introduce two improvements, $t$-poking and OOD sample weighting, to make supervised detectors more precise at the ID-OOD boundary. This is especially important when conflicts between real ID and synthetic OOD sample blur the decision boundary.
  Finally, we provide recommendations for constructing and applying out-of-distribution detectors in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanci Zhang, Han Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm for enhancing data privacy preservation. Its privacy-preserving nature complicates the explanation of the decision-making processes and the evaluation of the reliability of the generated explanations. In this paper, we propose the Uncertainty-aware eXplainable Federated Learning (UncertainXFL) to address these challenges. It generates explanations for decision-making processes under FL settings and provides information regarding the uncertainty of these explanations. UncertainXFL is the first framework to explicitly offer uncertainty evaluation for explanations within the FL context. Explanatory information is initially generated by the FL clients and then aggregated by the server in a comprehensive and conflict-free manner during FL training. The quality of the explanations, including the uncertainty score and tested validity, guides the FL training process by prioritizing clients with the most reliable explanations through higher weights during model aggregation. Extensive experimental evaluation results demonstrate that UncertainXFL achieves superior model accuracy and explanation accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art model that does not incorporate uncertainty information by 2.71% and 1.77%, respectively. By integrating and quantifying uncertainty in the data into the explanation process, UncertainXFL not only clearly presents the explanation alongside its uncertainty, but also leverages this uncertainty to guide the FL training process, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of the resulting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajnish Kumar, Tapas Tripura, Souvik Chakraborty, Sitikantha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Electromyography (EMG)--based computational musculoskeletal modeling is a non-invasive method for studying musculotendon function, human movement, and neuromuscular control, providing estimates of internal variables like muscle forces and joint torques. However, EMG signals from deeper muscles are often challenging to measure by placing the surface EMG electrodes and unfeasible to measure directly using invasive methods. The restriction to the access of EMG data from deeper muscles poses a considerable obstacle to the broad adoption of EMG-driven modeling techniques. A strategic alternative is to use an estimation algorithm to approximate the missing EMG signals from deeper muscle. A similar strategy is used in physics-informed deep learning, where the features of physical systems are learned without labeled data. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning algorithm, namely the neural musculoskeletal model (NMM), that integrates physics-informed and data-driven deep learning to approximate the EMG signals from the deeper muscles. While data-driven modeling is used to predict the missing EMG signals, physics-based modeling engraves the subject-specific information into the predictions. Experimental verifications on five test subjects are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed hybrid framework. The proposed NMM is validated against the joint torque computed from 'OpenSim' software. The predicted deep EMG signals are also compared against the state-of-the-art muscle synergy extrapolation (MSE) approach, where the proposed NMM completely outperforms the existing MSE framework by a significant margin.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05207">Policy Constraint by Only Support Constraint for Offline Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunkai Gao, Jiaming Guo, Fan Wu, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize a policy by using pre-collected datasets, to maximize cumulative rewards. However, offline reinforcement learning suffers challenges due to the distributional shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to errors when computing Q-values for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To mitigate this issue, policy constraint methods aim to constrain the learned policy's distribution with the distribution of the behavior policy or confine action selection within the support of the behavior policy. However, current policy constraint methods tend to exhibit excessive conservatism, hindering the policy from further surpassing the behavior policy's performance. In this work, we present Only Support Constraint (OSC) which is derived from maximizing the total probability of learned policy in the support of behavior policy, to address the conservatism of policy constraint. OSC presents a regularization term that only restricts policies to the support without imposing extra constraints on actions within the support. Additionally, to fully harness the performance of the new policy constraints, OSC utilizes a diffusion model to effectively characterize the support of behavior policies. Experimental evaluations across a variety of offline RL benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly enhances performance, alleviating the challenges associated with distributional shifts and mitigating conservatism of policy constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Nienk\"otter, Sandro Vega-Pons, Xiaoyi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness in terms of outliers is an important topic and has been formally studied for a variety of problems in machine learning and computer vision. Generalized median computation is a special instance of consensus learning and a common approach to finding prototypes. Related research can be found in numerous problem domains with a broad range of applications. So far, however, robustness of generalized median has only been studied in a few specific spaces. To our knowledge, there is no robustness characterization in a general setting, i.e. for arbitrary spaces. We address this open issue in our work. The breakdown point >=0.5 is proved for generalized median with metric distance functions in general. We also study the detailed behavior in case of outliers from different perspectives. In addition, we present robustness results for weighted generalized median computation and non-metric distance functions. Given the importance of robustness, our work contributes to closing a gap in the literature. The presented results have general impact and applicability, e.g. providing deeper understanding of generalized median computation and practical guidance to avoid non-robust computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baris Yilmaz, Erdem Akag\"und\"uz, Salih Tileylioglu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the use of deep learning for predicting the time averaged shear wave velocity in the top 30 m of the subsurface ($V_{s30}$) at strong motion recording stations in T\"urkiye. $V_{s30}$ is a key parameter in site characterization and, as a result for seismic hazard assessment. However, it is often unavailable due to the lack of direct measurements and is therefore estimated using empirical correlations. Such correlations however are commonly inadequate in capturing complex, site-specific variability and this motivates the need for data-driven approaches. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning model combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in strong motion records. Furthermore, we explore how using different parts of the signal influence our deep learning model. Our results suggest that the hybrid approach effectively learns complex, nonlinear relationships within seismic signals. We observed that an improved P-wave arrival time model increased the prediction accuracy of $V_{s30}$. We believe the study provides valuable insights into improving $V_{s30}$ predictions using a CNN-LSTM framework, demonstrating its potential for improving site characterization for seismic studies.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05238">Guaranteeing Out-Of-Distribution Detection in Deep RL via Transition Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohit Prashant, Arvind Easwaran, Suman Das, Michael Yuhas</p>
<p>Abstract: An issue concerning the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents is whether they can be trusted to perform reliably when deployed, as training environments may not reflect real-life environments. Anticipating instances outside their training scope, learning-enabled systems are often equipped with out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors that alert when a trained system encounters a state it does not recognize or in which it exhibits uncertainty. There exists limited work conducted on the problem of OOD detection within RL, with prior studies being unable to achieve a consensus on the definition of OOD execution within the context of RL. By framing our problem using a Markov Decision Process, we assume there is a transition distribution mapping each state-action pair to another state with some probability. Based on this, we consider the following definition of OOD execution within RL: A transition is OOD if its probability during real-life deployment differs from the transition distribution encountered during training. As such, we utilize conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) to approximate the transition dynamics of the training environment and implement a conformity-based detector using reconstruction loss that is able to guarantee OOD detection with a pre-determined confidence level. We evaluate our detector by adapting existing benchmarks and compare it with existing OOD detection models for RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroush H. Zargarbashi, Aleksandar Bojchevski</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) converts any model's output to prediction sets with a guarantee to cover the true label with (adjustable) high probability. Robust CP extends this guarantee to worst-case (adversarial) inputs. Existing baselines achieve robustness by bounding randomly smoothed conformity scores. In practice, they need expensive Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling (e.g. $\sim10^4$ samples per point) to maintain an acceptable set size. We propose a robust conformal prediction that produces smaller sets even with significantly lower MC samples (e.g. 150 for CIFAR10). Our approach binarizes samples with an adjustable (or automatically adjusted) threshold selected to preserve the coverage guarantee. Remarkably, we prove that robustness can be achieved by computing only one binary certificate, unlike previous methods that certify each calibration (or test) point. Thus, our method is faster and returns smaller robust sets. We also eliminate a previous limitation that requires a bounded score function.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05246">Mastering Continual Reinforcement Learning through Fine-Grained Sparse Network Allocation and Dormant Neuron Exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengqi Zheng, Haiyan Yin, Jianda Chen, Terrence Ng, Yew-Soon Ong, Ivor Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is essential for developing agents that can learn, adapt, and accumulate knowledge over time. However, a fundamental challenge persists as agents must strike a delicate balance between plasticity, which enables rapid skill acquisition, and stability, which ensures long-term knowledge retention while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce SSDE, a novel structure-based approach that enhances plasticity through a fine-grained allocation strategy with Structured Sparsity and Dormant-guided Exploration. SSDE decomposes the parameter space into forward-transfer (frozen) parameters and task-specific (trainable) parameters. Crucially, these parameters are allocated by an efficient co-allocation scheme under sparse coding, ensuring sufficient trainable capacity for new tasks while promoting efficient forward transfer through frozen parameters. However, structure-based methods often suffer from rigidity due to the accumulation of non-trainable parameters, limiting exploration and adaptability. To address this, we further introduce a sensitivity-guided neuron reactivation mechanism that systematically identifies and resets dormant neurons, which exhibit minimal influence in the sparse policy network during inference. This approach effectively enhance exploration while preserving structural efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CW10-v1 Continual World benchmark demonstrate that SSDE achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching a success rate of 95%, surpassing prior methods significantly in both plasticity and stability trade-offs (code is available at: https://github.com/chengqiArchy/SSDE).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungkyu Kang, Min-hwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning is based on pre-collected preference feedback over pairs of trajectories. While offline PbRL has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, existing theoretical approaches face challenges in ensuring conservatism under uncertainty, requiring computationally intractable confidence set constructions. We address this limitation by proposing Adversarial Preference-based Policy Optimization (APPO), a computationally efficient algorithm for offline PbRL that guarantees sample complexity bounds without relying on explicit confidence sets. By framing PbRL as a two-player game between a policy and a model, our approach enforces conservatism in a tractable manner. Using standard assumptions on function approximation and bounded trajectory concentrability, we derive a sample complexity bound. To our knowledge, APPO is the first offline PbRL algorithm to offer both statistical efficiency and practical applicability. Experimental results on continuous control tasks demonstrate that APPO effectively learns from complex datasets, showing comparable performance with existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code embeddings are essential for semantic code search; however, current approaches often struggle to capture the precise syntactic and contextual nuances inherent in code. Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on targeted datasets enhances task-specific performance but often comes at the expense of generalization. Model merging techniques, which integrate multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model through task arithmetic at various levels: model, layer, or parameter, offer a promising solution. However, task interference remains a fundamental challenge, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal merged models. Existing approaches largely overlook the fundamental role of individual neurons and their connectivity, resulting in a lack of interpretability in both the merging process and the merged models. In this work, we present the first study on the impact of neuronal alignment in model merging. We decompose task-specific representations into two complementary neuronal subspaces that regulate neuron sensitivity and input adaptability. Leveraging this decomposition, we introduce NeuroMerging, a novel merging framework developed to mitigate task interference within neuronal subspaces, enabling training-free model fusion across diverse tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NeuroMerging achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on multi-task benchmarks across both vision and natural language domains. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning neuronal mechanisms in model merging, offering new insights into mitigating task interference and improving knowledge fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct interaction between the user and external devices, typically via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zara Siddique, Irtaza Khalid, Liam D. Turner, Luis Espinosa-Anke</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs) by applying steering vectors to modify model activations in forward passes. We employ Bayesian optimization to systematically identify effective contrastive pair datasets across nine bias axes. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.2%, 4.7%, and 3.2% over the baseline for Mistral, Llama, and Qwen, respectively. Building on these promising results, we introduce Steering Vector Ensembles (SVE), a method that averages multiple individually optimized steering vectors, each targeting a specific bias axis such as age, race, or gender. By leveraging their collective strength, SVE outperforms individual steering vectors in both bias reduction and maintaining model performance. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that SVE is a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.</p>

We leverage RLVR to optimize the Omni model, significantly enhancing its performance in three key aspects: reasoning capability, emotion recognition accuracy, and generalization ability. The introduction of RLVR not only improves the model's overall performance on in-distribution data but also demonstrates superior robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution datasets. More importantly, the improved reasoning capability enables clear analysis of the contributions of different modalities, particularly visual and audio information, in the emotion recognition process. This provides valuable insights into the optimization of multimodal large language models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05424">Towards Locally Explaining Prediction Behavior via Gradual Interventions and Measuring Property Gradients</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Niklas Penzel, Joachim Denzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models achieve high predictive performance but lack intrinsic interpretability, hindering our understanding of the learned prediction behavior. Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide more general global explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to analyze network training dynamics, investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toshiaki Koike-Akino, Francesco Tonin, Yongtao Wu, Frank Zhengqing Wu, Leyla Naz Candogan, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum-PEFT that leverages quantum computations for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Unlike other additive PEFT methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), Quantum-PEFT exploits an underlying full-rank yet surprisingly parameter efficient quantum unitary parameterization. With the use of Pauli parameterization, the number of trainable parameters grows only logarithmically with the ambient dimension, as opposed to linearly as in LoRA-based PEFT methods. Quantum-PEFT achieves vanishingly smaller number of trainable parameters than the lowest-rank LoRA as dimensions grow, enhancing parameter efficiency while maintaining a competitive performance. We apply Quantum-PEFT to several transfer learning benchmarks in language and vision, demonstrating significant advantages in parameter efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weigao Sun, Disen Lan, Tong Zhu, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Sequence Modeling (LSM) like linear attention, state space models and linear RNNs, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have recently emerged as significant architectural improvements. In this paper, we introduce Linear-MoE, a production-level system for modeling and training large-scale models that integrate LSM with MoE. Linear-MoE leverages the advantages of both LSM modules for linear-complexity sequence modeling and MoE layers for sparsely activation, aiming to offer high performance with efficient training. The Linear-MoE system comprises: 1) Modeling subsystem, which provides a unified framework supporting all instances of LSM. and 2) Training subsystem, which facilitates efficient training by incorporating various advanced parallelism technologies, particularly Sequence Parallelism designed for Linear-MoE models. Additionally, we explore hybrid models that combine Linear-MoE layers with standard Transformer-MoE layers with its Sequence Parallelism to further enhance model flexibility and performance. Evaluations on two model series, A0.3B-2B and A1B-7B, demonstrate Linear-MoE achieves efficiency gains while maintaining competitive performance on various benchmarks, showcasing its potential as a next-generation foundational model architecture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taco Cohen, David W. Zhang, Kunhao Zheng, Yunhao Tang, Remi Munos, Gabriel Synnaeve</p>
<p>Abstract: RL-based post-training of language models is almost exclusively done using on-policy methods such as PPO. These methods cannot learn from arbitrary sequences such as those produced earlier in training, in earlier runs, by human experts or other policies, or by decoding and exploration methods. This results in severe sample inefficiency and exploration difficulties, as well as a potential loss of diversity in the policy responses. Moreover, asynchronous PPO implementations require frequent and costly model transfers, and typically use value models which require a large amount of memory. In this paper we introduce Soft Policy Optimization (SPO), a simple, scalable and principled Soft RL method for sequence model policies that can learn from arbitrary online and offline trajectories and does not require a separate value model. In experiments on code contests, we shows that SPO outperforms PPO on pass@10, is significantly faster and more memory efficient, is able to benefit from off-policy data, enjoys improved stability, and learns more diverse (i.e. soft) policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziran Zhou, Guanyu Gao, Xiaohu Wu, Yan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) aims to train a personalized model for each client that is tailored to its local data distribution, learning fails to perform well on individual clients due to variations in their local data distributions. Most existing PFL methods focus on personalizing the aggregated global model for each client, neglecting the fundamental aspect of federated learning: the regulation of how client models are aggregated. Additionally, almost all of them overlook the graph structure formed by clients in federated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Personalized Federated Learning with Graph Attention Network (pFedGAT), which captures the latent graph structure between clients and dynamically determines the importance of other clients for each client, enabling fine-grained control over the aggregation process. We evaluate pFedGAT across multiple data distribution scenarios, comparing it with twelve state of the art methods on three datasets: Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, and find that it consistently performs well.</p>

Even though transfer learning and multitask learning try to leverage the underlying task space, no well-founded tools are available to study its structure. This study proposes a theoretically grounded setup to define the notion of task and to compute the {\bf inclusion} between two tasks from a statistical deficiency point of view. We propose a tractable proxy as information sufficiency to estimate the degree of inclusion between tasks, show its soundness on synthetic data, and use it to reconstruct empirically the classic NLP pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: The design of novel molecules with desired properties is a key challenge in drug discovery and materials science. Traditional methods rely on trial-and-error, while recent deep learning approaches have accelerated molecular generation. However, existing models struggle with generating molecules based on specific textual descriptions. We introduce Mol-CADiff, a novel diffusion-based framework that uses causal attention mechanisms for text-conditional molecular generation. Our approach explicitly models the causal relationship between textual prompts and molecular structures, overcoming key limitations in existing methods. We enhance dependency modeling both within and across modalities, enabling precise control over the generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Mol-CADiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating diverse, novel, and chemically valid molecules, with better alignment to specified properties, enabling more intuitive language-driven molecular design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rickmer Schulte, David R\"ugamer</p>
<p>Abstract: Additive models (AMs) have sparked a lot of interest in machine learning recently, allowing the incorporation of interpretable structures into a wide range of model classes. Many commonly used approaches to fit a wide variety of potentially complex additive models build on the idea of boosting additive models. While boosted additive models (BAMs) work well in practice, certain theoretical aspects are still poorly understood, including general convergence behavior and what optimization problem is being solved when accounting for the implicit regularizing nature of boosting. In this work, we study the solution paths of BAMs and establish connections with other approaches for certain classes of problems. Along these lines, we derive novel convergence results for BAMs, which yield crucial insights into the inner workings of the method. While our results generally provide reassuring theoretical evidence for the practical use of BAMs, they also uncover some ``pathologies'' of boosting for certain additive model classes concerning their convergence behavior that require caution in practice. We empirically validate our theoretical findings through several numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonel Rozo, Miguel Gonz\'alez-Duque, No\'emie Jaquier, S{\o}ren Hauberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent variable models are powerful tools for learning low-dimensional manifolds from high-dimensional data. However, when dealing with constrained data such as unit-norm vectors or symmetric positive-definite matrices, existing approaches ignore the underlying geometric constraints or fail to provide meaningful metrics in the latent space. To address these limitations, we propose to learn Riemannian latent representations of such geometric data. To do so, we estimate the pullback metric induced by a Wrapped Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, which explicitly accounts for the data geometry. This enables us to define geometry-aware notions of distance and shortest paths in the latent space, while ensuring that our model only assigns probability mass to the data manifold. This generalizes previous work and allows us to handle complex tasks in various domains, including robot motion synthesis and analysis of brain connectomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Trumpp, Ansgar Sch\"afftlein, Mirco Theile, Marco Caccamo</p>
<p>Abstract: As image-based deep reinforcement learning tackles more challenging tasks, increasing model size has become an important factor in improving performance. Recent studies achieved this by focusing on the parameter efficiency of scaled networks, typically using Impala-CNN, a 15-layer ResNet-inspired network, as the image encoder. However, while Impala-CNN evidently outperforms older CNN architectures, potential advancements in network design for deep reinforcement learning-specific image encoders remain largely unexplored. We find that replacing the flattening of output feature maps in Impala-CNN with global average pooling leads to a notable performance improvement. This approach outperforms larger and more complex models in the Procgen Benchmark, particularly in terms of generalization. We call our proposed encoder model Impoola-CNN. A decrease in the network's translation sensitivity may be central to this improvement, as we observe the most significant gains in games without agent-centered observations. Our results demonstrate that network scaling is not just about increasing model size - efficient network design is also an essential factor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan Etzine, Masoud Hashemi, Nishanth Madhusudhan, Sagar Davasam, Roshnee Sharma, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Vikas Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks are becoming saturated and struggle to separate model performances due to factors like data contamination and advancing LLM capabilities. This paper introduces EMDM (Enhanced Model Differentiation Metric), a novel weighted metric that revitalizes benchmarks by enhancing model separation. EMDM integrates final answer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning correctness, assigning weights based on the complexity and reasoning depth required to solve a given sample in the evaluation data. Using a baseline LLM in two setups-Unguided, where the model has no prior exposure to test samples, and Guided, where the model has prior knowledge of the desired answer-EMDM distinguishes instances of varying difficulty. The CoT and answer correctness from these setups inform an optimization objective for weight assignment, resulting in a more nuanced evaluation of model performance. Compared to the exact match (EM) metric, which achieves 17% separation on ARC-Challenge, EMDM achieves 46%, demonstrating its effectiveness in differentiating models based on reasoning and knowledge requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability makes analysis and classification challenging. To address this, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework that captures both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers, linked through skip connections to preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. By mapping different realizations of a system - generated from the same underlying parameters - into a continuous, structured latent space, GAUDI disentangles invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate its power across multiple applications, including modeling small-world networks, characterizing protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analyzing collective motion in the Vicsek model, and capturing age-related changes in brain connectivity. This approach not only improves the analysis of complex graphs but also provides new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05563">Tractable Representations for Convergent Approximation of Distributional HJB Equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Julie Alhosh, Harley Wiltzer, David Meger</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), the long-term behavior of decision-making policies is evaluated based on their average returns. Distributional RL has emerged, presenting techniques for learning return distributions, which provide additional statistics for evaluating policies, incorporating risk-sensitive considerations. When the passage of time cannot naturally be divided into discrete time increments, researchers have studied the continuous-time RL (CTRL) problem, where agent states and decisions evolve continuously. In this setting, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is well established as the characterization of the expected return, and many solution methods exist. However, the study of distributional RL in the continuous-time setting is in its infancy. Recent work has established a distributional HJB (DHJB) equation, providing the first characterization of return distributions in CTRL. These equations and their solutions are intractable to solve and represent exactly, requiring novel approximation techniques. This work takes strides towards this end, establishing conditions on the method of parameterizing return distributions under which the DHJB equation can be approximately solved. Particularly, we show that under a certain topological property of the mapping between statistics learned by a distributional RL algorithm and corresponding distributions, approximation of these statistics leads to close approximations of the solution of the DHJB equation. Concretely, we demonstrate that the quantile representation common in distributional RL satisfies this topological property, certifying an efficient approximation algorithm for continuous-time distributional RL.</p>

Our BART Kernel (BARK) uses tree agreement to define a posterior over piecewise-constant functions, and we explore the space of tree kernels using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Where BART only samples functions, the resulting BARK model obtains samples of Gaussian processes defining distributions over functions, which allow us to build acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization. Our tree-based approach enables global optimization over the surrogate, even for mixed-feature spaces. Moreover, where many previous tree-based kernels provide uncertainty quantification over function values, our sampling scheme captures uncertainty over the tree structure itself. Our experiments show the strong performance of BARK on both synthetic and applied benchmarks, due to the combination of our fully Bayesian surrogate and the optimization procedure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Mu, Muhammad Shahzad, Xiao Xiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is crucial in extensive practical applications, such as environmental monitoring, medical EEG analysis, and action recognition. Real-world time series datasets typically exhibit complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, RNN-based, CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid models have been proposed. Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Shu, Xuansheng Wu, Haiyan Zhao, Daking Rai, Ziyu Yao, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of SAEs as a promising approach to interpreting and understanding LLMs. We provide a systematic overview of SAE principles, architectures, and applications specifically tailored for LLM analysis, covering theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and recent developments in sparsity mechanisms. We also explore how SAEs can be leveraged to explain the internal workings of LLMs, steer model behaviors in desired directions, and develop more transparent training methodologies for future models. Despite the challenges that remain around SAE implementation and scaling, they continue to provide valuable tools for understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional constitutive models rely on hand-crafted parametric forms with limited expressivity and generalizability, while neural network-based models can capture complex material behavior but often lack interpretability. To balance these trade-offs, we present Input-Convex Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (ICKANs) for learning polyconvex hyperelastic constitutive laws. ICKANs leverage the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation, decomposing the model into compositions of trainable univariate spline-based activation functions for rich expressivity. We introduce trainable input-convex splines within the KAN architecture, ensuring physically admissible polyconvex hyperelastic models. The resulting models are both compact and interpretable, enabling explicit extraction of analytical constitutive relationships through an input-convex symbolic regression techinque. Through unsupervised training on full-field strain data and limited global force measurements, ICKANs accurately capture nonlinear stress-strain behavior across diverse strain states. Finite element simulations of unseen geometries with trained ICKAN hyperelastic constitutive models confirm the framework's robustness and generalization capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimal allocation of scarce resources is a common problem for decision makers faced with choosing a limited number of locations for intervention. Spatiotemporal prediction models could make such decisions data-driven. A recent performance metric called fraction of best possible reach (BPR) measures the impact of using a model's recommended size K subset of sites compared to the best possible top-K in hindsight. We tackle two open problems related to BPR. First, we explore how to rank all sites numerically given a probabilistic model that predicts event counts jointly across sites. Ranking via the per-site mean is suboptimal for BPR. Instead, we offer a better ranking for BPR backed by decision theory. Second, we explore how to train a probabilistic model's parameters to maximize BPR. Discrete selection of K sites implies all-zero parameter gradients which prevent standard gradient training. We overcome this barrier via advances in perturbed optimizers. We further suggest a training objective that combines likelihood with a decision-aware BPR constraint to deliver high-quality top-K rankings as well as good forecasts for all sites. We demonstrate our approach on two where-to-intervene applications: mitigating opioid-related fatal overdoses for public health and monitoring endangered wildlife.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya K. Singh, Ted Moskovitz, Sara Dragutinovic, Felix Hill, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew M. Saxe</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that emerges in transformer models, enabling them to learn from context without weight updates. Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the disappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term "context-constrained in-weights learning" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term "strategy coopetition." We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harish Panneer Selvam, Bharat Jayaprakash, Yan Li, Shashi Shekhar, William F. Northrop</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a physics-based machine learning framework to predict and analyze oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from compression-ignition engine-powered vehicles using on-board diagnostics (OBD) data as input. Accurate NOx prediction from OBD datasets is difficult because NOx formation inside an engine combustion chamber is governed by complex processes occurring on timescales much shorter than the data collection rate. Thus, emissions generally cannot be predicted accurately using simple empirically derived physics models. Black box models like genetic algorithms or neural networks can be more accurate, but have poor interpretability. The transparent model presented in this paper has both high accuracy and can explain potential sources of high emissions. The proposed framework consists of two major steps: a physics-based NOx prediction model combined with a novel Divergent Window Co-occurrence (DWC) Pattern detection algorithm to analyze operating conditions that are not adequately addressed by the physics-based model. The proposed framework is validated for generalizability with a second vehicle OBD dataset, a sensitivity analysis is performed, and model predictions are compared with that from a deep neural network. The results show that NOx emissions predictions using the proposed model has around 55% better root mean square error, and around 60% higher mean absolute error compared to the baseline NOx prediction model from previously published work. The DWC Pattern Detection Algorithm identified low engine power conditions to have high statistical significance, indicating an operating regime where the model can be improved. This work shows that the physics-based machine learning framework is a viable method for predicting NOx emissions from engines that do not incorporate NOx sensing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasser H. Khalil, Leo Brunswic, Soufiane Lamghari, Xu Li, Mahdi Beitollahi, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated unlearning (FU) aims to remove a participant's data contributions from a trained federated learning (FL) model, ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance. Traditional FU methods often depend on auxiliary storage on either the client or server side or require direct access to the data targeted for removal-a dependency that may not be feasible if the data is no longer available. To overcome these limitations, we propose NoT, a novel and efficient FU algorithm based on weight negation (multiplying by -1), which circumvents the need for additional storage and access to the target data. We argue that effective and efficient unlearning can be achieved by perturbing model parameters away from the set of optimal parameters, yet being well-positioned for quick re-optimization. This technique, though seemingly contradictory, is theoretically grounded: we prove that the weight negation perturbation effectively disrupts inter-layer co-adaptation, inducing unlearning while preserving an approximate optimality property, thereby enabling rapid recovery. Experimental results across three datasets and three model architectures demonstrate that NoT significantly outperforms existing baselines in unlearning efficacy as well as in communication and computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ted Shaowang, Shinan Liu, Jonatas Marques, Nick Feamster, Sanjay Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning can analyze vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices to identify patterns, make predictions, and enable real-time decision-making. By processing sensor data, machine learning models can optimize processes, improve efficiency, and enhance personalized user experiences in smart systems. However, IoT systems are often deployed in sensitive environments such as households and offices, where they may inadvertently expose identifiable information, including location, habits, and personal identifiers. This raises significant privacy concerns, necessitating the application of data minimization -- a foundational principle in emerging data regulations, which mandates that service providers only collect data that is directly relevant and necessary for a specified purpose. Despite its importance, data minimization lacks a precise technical definition in the context of sensor data, where collections of weak signals make it challenging to apply a binary "relevant and necessary" rule. This paper provides a technical interpretation of data minimization in the context of sensor streams, explores practical methods for implementation, and addresses the challenges involved. Through our approach, we demonstrate that our framework can reduce user identifiability by up to 16.7% while maintaining accuracy loss below 1%, offering a viable path toward privacy-preserving IoT data processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parameswaran Kamalaruban, Mark Anderson, Stuart Burrell, Maeve Madigan, Piotr Skalski, David Sutton</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models can be adapted for specific tasks using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, the fairness properties of these adapted classifiers remain underexplored. Existing fairness-aware fine-tuning methods rely on direct access to sensitive attributes or their predictors, but in practice, these sensitive attributes are often held under strict consumer privacy controls, and neither the attributes nor their predictors are available to model developers, hampering the development of fair models. To address this issue, we introduce a set of LoRA-based fine-tuning methods that can be trained in a distributed fashion, where model developers and fairness auditors collaborate without sharing sensitive attributes or predictors. In this paper, we evaluate three such methods - sensitive unlearning, adversarial training, and orthogonality loss - against a fairness-unaware baseline, using experiments on the CelebA and UTK-Face datasets with an ImageNet pre-trained ViT-Base model. We find that orthogonality loss consistently reduces bias while maintaining or improving utility, whereas adversarial training improves False Positive Rate Parity and Demographic Parity in some cases, and sensitive unlearning provides no clear benefit. In tasks where significant biases are present, distributed fairness-aware fine-tuning methods can effectively eliminate bias without compromising consumer privacy and, in most cases, improve model utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Liu, Cyrus Neary, Kushagra Gupta, Christian Ellis, Ufuk Topcu, David Fridovich-Keil</p>
<p>Abstract: Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms require large amounts of data, prohibiting their use in applications where frequent interactions with operational systems are infeasible, or high-fidelity simulations are expensive or unavailable. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators--such as reduced-order models, heuristic reward functions, or generative world models--can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for direct sim-to-real transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to form unbiased, reduced-variance estimators (control variates) for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework by developing multi-fidelity variants of two policy gradient algorithms: REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization. Experimental results across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark problems demonstrate that when target-environment samples are limited, MFPG achieves up to 3.9x higher reward and improves training stability when compared to baselines that only use high-fidelity data. Moreover, even when the baselines are given more high-fidelity samples--up to 10x as many interactions with the target environment--MFPG continues to match or outperform them. Finally, we observe that MFPG is capable of training effective policies even when the low-fidelity environment is drastically different from the target environment. MFPG thus not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Deng, Shengqian Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) for precoder optimization effectively balances performance and fairness among users. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning in precoder optimization for sum rate maximization. However, the WSRM problem necessitates a redesign of neural network architectures to incorporate user weights into the input. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) to learn the precoder for WSRM. Compared to existing DNNs, the proposed DNN leverage the joint unitary and permutation equivariant property inherent in the optimal precoding policy, effectively enhancing learning performance while reducing training complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline learning methods in terms of both learning and generalization performance while maintaining low training and inference complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Hartley, Conor Hamill, Devesh Batra, Dale Seddon, Ramin Okhrati, Raad Khraishi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, necessitating a deeper understanding of their decision-making behaviour under risk. This study investigates the relationship between LLMs' personality traits and risk propensity, employing cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and the Big Five personality framework. We focus on GPT-4o, comparing its behaviour to human baselines and earlier models. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o exhibits higher Conscientiousness and Agreeableness traits compared to human averages, while functioning as a risk-neutral rational agent in prospect selection. Interventions on GPT-4o's Big Five traits, particularly Openness, significantly influence its risk propensity, mirroring patterns observed in human studies. Notably, Openness emerges as the most influential factor in GPT-4o's risk propensity, aligning with human findings. In contrast, legacy models like GPT-4-Turbo demonstrate inconsistent generalization of the personality-risk relationship. This research advances our understanding of LLM behaviour under risk and elucidates the potential and limitations of personality-based interventions in shaping LLM decision-making. Our findings have implications for the development of more robust and predictable AI systems such as financial modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Marvin Imperial, Matthew D. Jones, Harish Tayyar Madabushi</p>
<p>Abstract: Technical standards, or simply standards, are established documented guidelines and rules that facilitate the interoperability, quality, and accuracy of systems and processes. In recent years, we have witnessed an emerging paradigm shift where the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) models has increased tremendously, spreading implementation interests across standard-driven industries, including engineering, legal, healthcare, and education. In this paper, we assess the criticality levels of different standards across domains and sectors and complement them by grading the current compliance capabilities of state-of-the-art GenAI models. To support the discussion, we outline possible challenges and opportunities with integrating GenAI for standard compliance tasks while also providing actionable recommendations for entities involved with developing and using standards. Overall, we argue that aligning GenAI with standards through computational methods can help strengthen regulatory and operational compliance. We anticipate this area of research will play a central role in the management, oversight, and trustworthiness of larger, more powerful GenAI-based systems in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Herrera-Poyatos, Javier Del Ser, Marcos L\'opez de Prado, Fei-Yue Wang, Enrique Herrera-Viedma, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has matured as a technology, necessitating the development of responsibility frameworks that are fair, inclusive, trustworthy, safe and secure, transparent, and accountable. By establishing such frameworks, we can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks, particularly in high-risk scenarios. This requires the design of responsible AI systems based on trustworthy AI technologies and ethical principles, with the aim of ensuring auditability and accountability throughout their design, development, and deployment, adhering to domain-specific regulations and standards.
  This paper explores the concept of a responsible AI system from a holistic perspective, which encompasses four key dimensions: 1) regulatory context; 2) trustworthy AI technology along with standardization and assessments; 3) auditability and accountability; and 4) AI governance. The aim of this paper is double. First, we analyze and understand these four dimensions and their interconnections in the form of an analysis and overview. Second, the final goal of the paper is to propose a roadmap in the design of responsible AI systems, ensuring that they can gain society's trust. To achieve this trustworthiness, this paper also fosters interdisciplinary discussions on the ethical, legal, social, economic, and cultural aspects of AI from a global governance perspective. Last but not least, we also reflect on the current state and those aspects that need to be developed in the near future, as ten lessons learned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthony Diamond</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Perspective Reasoning for Integrated Synthesis and Mediation (PRISM), a multiple-perspective framework for addressing persistent challenges in AI alignment such as conflicting human values and specification gaming. Grounded in cognitive science and moral psychology, PRISM organizes moral concerns into seven "basis worldviews", each hypothesized to capture a distinct dimension of human moral cognition, ranging from survival-focused reflexes through higher-order integrative perspectives. It then applies a Pareto-inspired optimization scheme to reconcile competing priorities without reducing them to a single metric. Under the assumption of reliable context validation for robust use, the framework follows a structured workflow that elicits viewpoint-specific responses, synthesizes them into a balanced outcome, and mediates remaining conflicts in a transparent and iterative manner. By referencing layered approaches to moral cognition from cognitive science, moral psychology, and neuroscience, PRISM clarifies how different moral drives interact and systematically documents and mediates ethical tradeoffs. We illustrate its efficacy through real outputs produced by a working prototype, applying PRISM to classic alignment problems in domains such as public health policy, workplace automation, and education. By anchoring AI deliberation in these human vantage points, PRISM aims to bound interpretive leaps that might otherwise drift into non-human or machine-centric territory. We briefly outline future directions, including real-world deployments and formal verifications, while maintaining the core focus on multi-perspective synthesis and conflict mediation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hritik Bansal, Pratyush Maini</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement in building large language models (LLMs) has intensified competition among big-tech companies and AI startups. In this regard, model evaluations are critical for product and investment-related decision-making. While open evaluation sets like MMLU initially drove progress, concerns around data contamination and data bias have constantly questioned their reliability. As a result, it has led to the rise of private data curators who have begun conducting hidden evaluations with high-quality self-curated test prompts and their own expert annotators. In this paper, we argue that despite potential advantages in addressing contamination issues, private evaluations introduce inadvertent financial and evaluation risks. In particular, the key concerns include the potential conflict of interest arising from private data curators' business relationships with their clients (leading LLM firms). In addition, we highlight that the subjective preferences of private expert annotators will lead to inherent evaluation bias towards the models trained with the private curators' data. Overall, this paper lays the foundation for studying the risks of private evaluations that can lead to wide-ranging community discussions and policy changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel R. Bayer, Felix Haag, Marco Pruckner, Konstantin Hopf</p>
<p>Abstract: Short-term forecasting of residential electricity demand is an important task for utilities. Yet, many small and medium-sized utilities still use simple forecasting approaches such as Synthesized Load Profiles, which treat residential households similarly and neither account for renewable energy installations nor novel large consumers (e.g., heat pumps, electric vehicles). The effectiveness of such "one-fits-all" approaches in future grid states--where decentral generation and sector coupling increases--are questionable. Our study challenges these forecasting practices and investigates whether Machine Learning (ML) approaches are suited to predict electricity demand in today's and in future grid states. We use real smart meter data from 3,511 households in Germany over 34 months. We extrapolate this data with future grid states (i.e., increased decentral generation and storage) based on a digital twin of a local energy system. Our results show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approaches outperform SLPs as well as simple benchmark estimators with up to 68.5% lower Root Mean Squared Error for a day-ahead forecast, especially in future grid states. Nevertheless, all prediction approaches perform worse in future grid states. Our findings therefore reinforce the need (a) for utilities and grid operators to employ ML approaches instead of traditional demand prediction methods in future grid states and (b) to prepare current ML methods for future grid states.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite widespread speculation about artificial intelligence's impact on the future of work, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how these systems are actually being used for different tasks. Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system to analyze over four million Claude.ai conversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with approximately 36% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI's evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance.</p>

<p>Abstract: There have recently been many cases of unverified or misleading information circulating quickly over bogus web networks and news portals. This false news creates big damage to society and misleads people. For Example, in 2019, there was a rumor that the Padma Bridge of Bangladesh needed 100,000 human heads for sacrifice. This rumor turns into a deadly position and this misleading information takes the lives of innocent people. There is a lot of work in English but a few works in Bangla. In this study, we are going to identify the fake news from the unconsidered news source to provide the newsreader with natural news or real news. The paper is based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), where CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. The first thing we did to deploy this piece of work was data collection. We compiled a data set from websites and attempted to deploy it using the methodology of deep learning which contains about 50k of news. With the proposed model of Multichannel combined CNN-LSTM architecture, our model gained an accuracy of 75.05%, which is a good sign for detecting fake news in Bangla.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Qiu, Yi-Chen Li, Xuqin Zhang, Tianyi Zhang, Yihang Zhang, Zongzhang Zhang, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning reward models from human preference datasets and subsequently optimizing language models via reinforcement learning has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for aligning LLMs with human preferences. The performance of the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment. Previous reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the generation of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward may present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent efforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit semantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual token. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence, introducing an intermediate-grained reward model. By segmenting the complete response into sentences and applying differential operations to reward output at the start and end positions of each sentence, we can effectively model the rewards of sentences. Moreover, a novel attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate the scores of all sentences into a response-level score, which allows it to be trained using the Bradley-Terry model. On common benchmarks, our method outperforms the response-level reward model by 2.7% on RewardBench (for reward modeling evaluation) and surpasses all baselines on AlpacaEval (for alignment evaluation).</p>

<p>Abstract: Parallel corpora play an important role in training machine translation (MT) models, particularly for low-resource languages where high-quality bilingual data is scarce. This review provides a comprehensive overview of available parallel corpora for Indic languages, which span diverse linguistic families, scripts, and regional variations. We categorize these corpora into text-to-text, code-switched, and various categories of multimodal datasets, highlighting their significance in the development of robust multilingual MT systems. Beyond resource enumeration, we critically examine the challenges faced in corpus creation, including linguistic diversity, script variation, data scarcity, and the prevalence of informal textual content.We also discuss and evaluate these corpora in various terms such as alignment quality and domain representativeness. Furthermore, we address open challenges such as data imbalance across Indic languages, the trade-off between quality and quantity, and the impact of noisy, informal, and dialectal data on MT performance. Finally, we outline future directions, including leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning, expanding multilingual datasets, and integrating multimodal resources to enhance translation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive review of parallel corpora specifically tailored for low-resource Indic languages in the context of machine translation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP) entails finding the subset of observation targets to be scheduled along the satellite's orbit while meeting operational constraints of time, energy and memory. The problem of deciding what and when to observe is inherently complex, and becomes even more challenging when considering several issues that compromise the quality of the captured images, such as cloud occlusion, atmospheric turbulence, and image resolution. This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for addressing the AEOSSP with time-dependent profits, integrating these three factors to optimize the use of energy and memory resources. The proposed method involves a dual decision-making process: selecting the sequence of targets and determining the optimal observation time for each. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the capture of images that fail to meet quality requirements by > 60% and consequently decreases energy waste from attitude maneuvers by up to 78%, all while maintaining strong observation performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs), exemplified by DeepSeek R1, have shown that even a simple question-answering task can substantially improve an LLM's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we extend this approach by modifying the task into a multi-attempt setting. Instead of generating a single response per question, the model is given multiple attempts, with feedback provided after incorrect responses. The multi-attempt task encourages the model to refine its previous attempts and improve search efficiency. Experimental results show that even a small LLM trained on a multi-attempt task achieves significantly higher accuracy when evaluated with more attempts, improving from 45.6% with 1 attempt to 52.5% with 2 attempts on the math benchmark. In contrast, the same LLM trained on a standard single-turn task exhibits only a marginal improvement, increasing from 42.3% to 43.2% when given more attempts during evaluation. The results indicate that, compared to the standard single-turn task, an LLM trained on a multi-attempt task achieves slightly better performance on math benchmarks while also learning to refine its responses more effectively based on user feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Lan, Liqiang Niu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models play a critical role in tasks such as interleaved image-text retrieval, multimodal RAG, and multimodal clustering. However, our empirical results indicate that existing LMM-based embedding models trained with the standard InfoNCE loss exhibit a high degree of overlap in similarity distribution between positive and negative pairs, making it challenging to distinguish hard negative pairs effectively. To deal with this issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework that dynamically improves the embedding model's representation learning for negative pairs based on their discriminative difficulty. Within this framework, we train a series of models, named LLaVE, and evaluate them on the MMEB benchmark, which covers 4 meta-tasks and 36 datasets. Experimental results show that LLaVE establishes stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while demonstrating strong scalability and efficiency. Specifically, LLaVE-2B surpasses the previous SOTA 7B models, while LLaVE-7B achieves a further performance improvement of 6.2 points. Although LLaVE is trained on image-text data, it can generalize to text-video retrieval tasks in a zero-shot manner and achieve strong performance, demonstrating its remarkable potential for transfer to other embedding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis Vitor Zerkowski, Zixuan Wang, Ilya Vidrin, Mariel Pettee</p>
<p>Abstract: Dancing in a duet often requires a heightened attunement to one's partner: their orientation in space, their momentum, and the forces they exert on you. Dance artists who work in partnered settings might have a strong embodied understanding in the moment of how their movements relate to their partner's, but typical documentation of dance fails to capture these varied and subtle relationships. Working closely with dance artists interested in deepening their understanding of partnering, we leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to highlight and interpret the intricate connections shared by two dancers. Using a video-to-3D-pose extraction pipeline, we extract 3D movements from curated videos of contemporary dance duets, apply a dedicated pre-processing to improve the reconstruction, and train a GNN to predict weighted connections between the dancers. By visualizing and interpreting the predicted relationships between the two movers, we demonstrate the potential for graph-based methods to construct alternate models of the collaborative dynamics of duets. Finally, we offer some example strategies for how to use these insights to inform a generative and co-creative studio practice.</p>

The importance of the choice of kernel bandwidth is stressed, showing how it affects the behaviour of the discrepancy estimation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishakha Agrawal, Archie Chaudhury, Shreya Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally next-token prediction systems, their practical applications extend far beyond this basic function. From natural language processing and text generation to conversational assistants and software use, LLMs have numerous use-cases, and have already acquired a significant degree of enterprise adoption. To evaluate such models, static evaluation datasets, consisting of a set of prompts and their corresponding ground truths, are often used to benchmark the efficacy of the model for a particular task. In this paper, we provide the basis for a more comprehensive evaluation framework, based upon a traditional game and tool-based architecture that enables a more overarching measurement of a model's capabilities. For simplicity, we provide a generalized foundation that can be extended, without significant alteration, to numerous scenarios, from specific use cases such as supply chain management or financial reasoning, to abstract measurements such as ethics or safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghyeok Shin, HeeSun Bae, Gyuwon Sim, Wanmo Kang, Il-Chul Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: Utilizing a large-scale dataset is essential for training high-performance deep learning models, but it also comes with substantial computation and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution by compressing the large-scale dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset that retains the essential information needed for training. This paper proposes a novel parameterization framework for dataset distillation, coined Distilling Dataset into Neural Field (DDiF), which leverages the neural field to store the necessary information of the large-scale dataset. Due to the unique nature of the neural field, which takes coordinates as input and output quantity, DDiF effectively preserves the information and easily generates various shapes of data. We theoretically confirm that DDiF exhibits greater expressiveness than some previous literature when the utilized budget for a single synthetic instance is the same. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DDiF achieves superior performance on several benchmark datasets, extending beyond the image domain to include video, audio, and 3D voxel.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Trung Tran, Nasrin Sohrabi, Zahir Tari, Qin Wang, Xiaoyu Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: We identify the slow liquidity drain (SLID) scam, an insidious and highly profitable threat to decentralized finance (DeFi), posing a large-scale, persistent, and growing risk to the ecosystem. Unlike traditional scams such as rug pulls or honeypots (USENIX Sec'19, USENIX Sec'23), SLID gradually siphons funds from liquidity pools over extended periods, making detection significantly more challenging. In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected liquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We propose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early detection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times faster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy. Our study establishes a foundation for protecting DeFi investors at an early stage and promoting transparency in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract: True intelligence hinges on the ability to uncover and leverage hidden causal relations. Despite significant progress in AI and computer vision (CV), there remains a lack of benchmarks for assessing models' abilities to infer latent causality from complex visual data. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{Causal3D}}, a novel and comprehensive benchmark that integrates structured data (tables) with corresponding visual representations (images) to evaluate causal reasoning. Designed within a systematic framework, Causal3D comprises 19 3D-scene datasets capturing diverse causal relations, views, and backgrounds, enabling evaluations across scenes of varying complexity. We assess multiple state-of-the-art methods, including classical causal discovery, causal representation learning, and large/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). Our experiments show that as causal structures grow more complex without prior knowledge, performance declines significantly, highlighting the challenges even advanced methods face in complex causal scenarios. Causal3D serves as a vital resource for advancing causal reasoning in CV and fostering trustworthy AI in critical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Devi Dutta Biswajeet, Sara Kadkhodaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning in materials science faces challenges due to limited experimental data, as generating synthesis data is costly and time-consuming, especially with in-house experiments. Mining data from existing literature introduces issues like mixed data quality, inconsistent formats, and variations in reporting experimental parameters, complicating the creation of consistent features for the learning algorithm. Additionally, combining continuous and discrete features can hinder the learning process with limited data. Here, we propose strategies that utilize large language models (LLMs) to enhance machine learning performance on a limited, heterogeneous dataset of graphene chemical vapor deposition synthesis compiled from existing literature. These strategies include prompting modalities for imputing missing data points and leveraging large language model embeddings to encode the complex nomenclature of substrates reported in chemical vapor deposition experiments. The proposed strategies enhance graphene layer classification using a support vector machine (SVM) model, increasing binary classification accuracy from 39% to 65% and ternary accuracy from 52% to 72%. We compare the performance of the SVM and a GPT-4 model, both trained and fine-tuned on the same data. Our results demonstrate that the numerical classifier, when combined with LLM-driven data enhancements, outperforms the standalone LLM predictor, highlighting that in data-scarce scenarios, improving predictive learning with LLM strategies requires more than simple fine-tuning on datasets. Instead, it necessitates sophisticated approaches for data imputation and feature space homogenization to achieve optimal performance. The proposed strategies emphasize data enhancement techniques, offering a broadly applicable framework for improving machine learning performance on scarce, inhomogeneous datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexey Buzovkin, Evgeny Shilov</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate methods to reduce inference time and memory footprint in stable diffusion models by introducing lightweight decoders for both image and video synthesis. Traditional latent diffusion pipelines rely on large Variational Autoencoder decoders that can slow down generation and consume considerable GPU memory. We propose custom-trained decoders using lightweight Vision Transformer and Taming Transformer architectures. Experiments show up to 15% overall speed-ups for image generation on COCO2017 and up to 20 times faster decoding in the sub-module, with additional gains on UCF-101 for video tasks. Memory requirements are moderately reduced, and while there is a small drop in perceptual quality compared to the default decoder, the improvements in speed and scalability are crucial for large-scale inference scenarios such as generating 100K images. Our work is further contextualized by advances in efficient video generation, including dual masking strategies, illustrating a broader effort to improve the scalability and efficiency of generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joan C. Timoneda, Sebasti\'an Vallejo Vera</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in text annotation using zero-shot and few-shot learning. Yet these approaches do not allow the model to retain information from previous annotations, making each response independent from the preceding ones. This raises the question of whether model memory -- the LLM having knowledge about its own previous annotations in the same task -- affects performance. In this article, using OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta's Llama 3.1 on two political science datasets, we demonstrate that allowing the model to retain information about its own previous classifications yields significant performance improvements: between 5 and 25\% when compared to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Moreover, memory reinforcement, a novel approach we propose that combines model memory and reinforcement learning, yields additional performance gains in three out of our four tests. These findings have important implications for applied researchers looking to improve performance and efficiency in LLM annotation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Wilcox, Mohamed Ghanem, Masoud Moghani, Pierre Barroso, Benjamin Joffe, Animesh Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has been very effective in training robots to perform complex and diverse manipulation tasks. However, its performance declines precipitously when the observations are out of the training distribution. 3D scene representations that incorporate observations from calibrated RGBD cameras have been proposed as a way to improve generalizability of IL policies, but our evaluations in cross-embodiment and novel camera pose settings found that they show only modest improvement. To address those challenges, we propose Adaptive 3D Scene Representation (Adapt3R), a general-purpose 3D observation encoder which uses a novel architecture to synthesize data from one or more RGBD cameras into a single vector that can then be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms. The key idea is to use a pretrained 2D backbone to extract semantic information about the scene, using 3D only as a medium for localizing this semantic information with respect to the end-effector. We show that when trained end-to-end with several SOTA multi-task IL algorithms, Adapt3R maintains these algorithms' multi-task learning capacity while enabling zero-shot transfer to novel embodiments and camera poses. Furthermore, we provide a detailed suite of ablation and sensitivity experiments to elucidate the design space for point cloud observation encoders.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the potential of abstracting complex visual information into discrete, structured symbolic sequences using self-supervised learning (SSL). Inspired by how language abstracts and organizes information to enable better reasoning and generalization, we propose a novel approach for generating symbolic representations from visual data. To learn these sequences, we extend the DINO framework to handle visual and symbolic information. Initial experiments suggest that the generated symbolic sequences capture a meaningful level of abstraction, though further refinement is required. An advantage of our method is its interpretability: the sequences are produced by a decoder transformer using cross-attention, allowing attention maps to be linked to specific symbols and offering insight into how these representations correspond to image regions. This approach lays the foundation for creating interpretable symbolic representations with potential applications in high-level scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehan Long, Ki Myung Brian Lee, Nikola Raicevic, Niyas Attasseri, Melvin Leok, Nikolay Atanasov</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning and control for high-dimensional robot manipulators in cluttered, dynamic environments require both computational efficiency and robust safety guarantees. Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space, substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for rover localization on Mars. Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile robots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied environments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is computationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel encoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the sandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific surveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and localization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and the upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the search of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in Mars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep learning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose prediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework to output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog environment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both outperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in high-slip environments. Lastly, we present the first dataset aimed at GPR-based localization in Mars analog environments, which will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel problem called the ForeClassing problem where the loss of a classification decision is only observed at a future time point after the classification decision has to be made. To solve this problem, we propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network architecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the time series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of occurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this, we introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and Boltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to iteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted time points for each inputted time series to the network through successive forward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned representation of the observed realizations of the time series for its classification decision. Boltzmann convolutional layers are linear combinations of approximately Bayesian convolutional layers with different filter lengths, allowing the model to learn multitemporal resolution representations of the input time series, and which resolutions to focus on within a given Boltzmann convolutional layer through a Boltzmann distribution. Through several simulation scenarios and two real world applications we demonstrate ForeClassNet achieves superior performance compared with current state of the art methods including a near 30% improvement in test set accuracy in our financial example compared to the second best performing model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile robots are essential in applications such as autonomous delivery and hospitality services. Applying learning-based methods to address mobile robot tasks has gained popularity due to its robustness and generalizability. Traditional methods such as Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer adaptability but require large datasets, carefully crafted reward functions, and face sim-to-real gaps, making them challenging for efficient and safe real-world deployment. We propose an online human-in-the-loop learning method PVP4Real that combines IL and RL to address these issues. PVP4Real enables efficient real-time policy learning from online human intervention and demonstration, without reward or any pretraining, significantly improving data efficiency and training safety. We validate our method by training two different robots -- a legged quadruped, and a wheeled delivery robot -- in two mobile robot tasks, one of which even uses raw RGBD image as observation. The training finishes within 15 minutes. Our experiments show the promising future of human-in-the-loop learning in addressing the data efficiency issue in real-world robotic tasks.

<p>Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.</p>

This fundamental limitation drives ML research, particularly in the exploration of alternative neural network architectures that integrate novel building blocks, such as advanced activation functions. Tunnel diodes are well-known electronic components that utilise the physical effect of quantum tunnelling (QT). Here, we propose using the current voltage characteristic of a tunnel diode as a novel, physics-based activation function for neural networks. We demonstrate that the tunnel-diode activation function (TDAF) outperforms traditional activation functions in terms of accuracy and loss during both training and evaluation. We also highlight its potential for implementation in electronic circuits suited to developing neuromorphic, quantum-inspired AI systems capable of operating in environments not suitable for qubit-based quantum computing hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jifan Zhang, Fangxin Wang, Philip S. Yu, Kaize Ding, Shixiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Stream networks, a unique class of spatiotemporal graphs, exhibit complex directional flow constraints and evolving dependencies, making uncertainty quantification a critical yet challenging task. Traditional conformal prediction methods struggle in this setting due to the need for joint predictions across multiple interdependent locations and the intricate spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in stream networks. Existing approaches either neglect dependencies, leading to overly conservative predictions, or rely solely on data-driven estimations, failing to capture the rich topological structure of the network. To address these challenges, we propose Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Conformal Inference (\texttt{STACI}), a novel framework that integrates network topology and temporal dynamics into the conformal prediction framework. \texttt{STACI} introduces a topology-aware nonconformity score that respects directional flow constraints and dynamically adjusts prediction sets to account for temporal distributional shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees on the validity of our approach and demonstrate its superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that \texttt{STACI} effectively balances prediction efficiency and coverage, outperforming existing conformal prediction methods for stream networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present novel algorithmic techniques to efficiently verify the Kruskal rank of matrices that arise in sparse linear regression, tensor decomposition, and latent variable models. Our unified framework combines randomized hashing techniques with dynamic programming strategies, and is applicable in various settings, including binary fields, general finite fields, and integer matrices. In particular, our algorithms achieve a runtime of $\mathcal{O}\left(dk \cdot \left(nM\right)^{\lceil k / 2 \rceil}\right)$ while ensuring high-probability correctness. Our contributions include: A unified framework for verifying Kruskal rank across different algebraic settings; Rigorous runtime and high-probability guarantees that nearly match known lower bounds; Practical implications for identifiability in tensor decompositions and deep learning, particularly for the estimation of noise transition matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyamin Jamialahmadi, Parsa Kavehzadeh, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Parsa Farinneya, Hossein Rajabzadeh, Aref Jafari, Boxing Chen, Marzieh Tahaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is often hindered by strict computational and latency constraints. While dynamic inference offers the flexibility to adjust model behavior based on varying resource budgets, existing methods are frequently limited by hardware inefficiencies or performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce Balcony, a simple yet highly effective framework for depth-based dynamic inference. By freezing the pretrained LLM and inserting additional transformer layers at selected exit points, Balcony maintains the full model's performance while enabling real-time adaptation to different computational budgets. These additional layers are trained using a straightforward self-distillation loss, aligning the sub-model outputs with those of the full model. This approach requires significantly fewer training tokens and tunable parameters, drastically reducing computational costs compared to prior methods. When applied to the LLaMA3-8B model, using only 0.2% of the original pretraining data, Balcony achieves minimal performance degradation while enabling significant speedups. Remarkably, we show that Balcony outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Flextron and Layerskip as well as other leading compression techniques on multiple models and at various scales, across a variety of benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divakar Vashisth, Rohan Sharma, Tapan Mukerji, Mrinal K. Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing leverages qubits, exploiting superposition and entanglement to solve problems intractable for classical computers, offering significant computational advantages. Quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning, holds immense potential across various fields but remains largely unexplored in geosciences. However, its progress is hindered by the limitations of current NISQ hardware. To address these challenges, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged, combining quantum layers within classical neural networks to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first application of QML to subsurface imaging through the development of hybrid quantum physics-informed neural networks (HQ-PINNs) for seismic inversion. We apply the HQ-PINN framework to invert pre-stack and post-stack seismic datasets, estimating P- and S-impedances. The proposed HQ-PINN architecture follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder (HQNN), processes seismic data to estimate elastic parameters, while the decoder utilizes these parameters to generate the corresponding seismic data based on geophysical relationships. The HQ-PINN model is trained by minimizing the misfit between the input and predicted seismic data generated by the decoder. We systematically evaluate various quantum layer configurations, differentiation methods, and quantum device simulators on the inversion performance, and demonstrate real-world applicability through the individual and simultaneous inversion cases of the Sleipner dataset. The HQ-PINN framework consistently and efficiently estimated accurate subsurface impedances across the synthetic and field case studies, establishing the feasibility of leveraging QML for seismic inversion, thereby paving the way for broader applications of quantum computing in geosciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yordan P. Raykov, Hengrui Luo, Justin D. Strait, Wasiur R. KhudaBukhsh</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose causal effect estimators based on empirical Fr\'{e}chet means and operator-valued kernels, tailored to functional data spaces. These methods address the challenges of high-dimensionality, sequential ordering, and model complexity while preserving robustness to treatment misspecification. Using structural assumptions, we obtain compact representations of potential outcomes, enabling scalable estimation of causal effects over time and across covariates. We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators.
  Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions. These advancements extend causal inference to dynamic and non-linear domains, offering new tools for understanding complex treatment effects in functional data settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyou Zhang, Yihang Yao, Shiqi Liu, Yaru Niu, Changyi Lin, Yuxiang Yang, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Jie Tan, Ding Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: When operating at their full capacity, quadrupedal robots can produce loud footstep noise, which can be disruptive in human-centered environments like homes, offices, and hospitals. As a result, balancing locomotion performance with noise constraints is crucial for the successful real-world deployment of quadrupedal robots. However, achieving adaptive noise control is challenging due to (a) the trade-off between agility and noise minimization, (b) the need for generalization across diverse deployment conditions, and (c) the difficulty of effectively adjusting policies based on noise requirements. We propose QuietPaw, a framework incorporating our Conditional Noise-Constrained Policy (CNCP), a constrained learning-based algorithm that enables flexible, noise-aware locomotion by conditioning policy behavior on noise-reduction levels. We leverage value representation decomposition in the critics, disentangling state representations from condition-dependent representations and this allows a single versatile policy to generalize across noise levels without retraining while improving the Pareto trade-off between agility and noise reduction. We validate our approach in simulation and the real world, demonstrating that CNCP can effectively balance locomotion performance and noise constraints, achieving continuously adjustable noise reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu, Himanshu Naidu, Chirag Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: As question answering (QA) systems advance alongside the rapid evolution of foundation models, the need for robust, adaptable, and large-scale evaluation benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. Traditional QA benchmarks are often static and publicly available, making them susceptible to data contamination and memorization by large language models (LLMs). Consequently, static benchmarks may overestimate model generalization and hinder a reliable assessment of real-world performance. In this work, we introduce Dynamic-KGQA, a scalable framework for generating adaptive QA datasets from knowledge graphs (KGs), designed to mitigate memorization risks while maintaining statistical consistency across iterations. Unlike fixed benchmarks, Dynamic-KGQA generates a new dataset variant on every run while preserving the underlying distribution, enabling fair and reproducible evaluations. Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over dataset characteristics, supporting domain-specific and topic-focused QA dataset generation. Additionally, Dynamic-KGQA produces compact, semantically coherent subgraphs that facilitate both training and evaluation of KGQA models, enhancing their ability to leverage structured knowledge effectively. To align with existing evaluation protocols, we also provide static large-scale train/test/validation splits, ensuring comparability with prior methods. By introducing a dynamic, customizable benchmarking paradigm, Dynamic-KGQA enables a more rigorous and adaptable evaluation of QA systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical topic modeling is widely used in political science to study text. Researchers examine documents of varying lengths, from tweets to speeches. There is ongoing debate on how document length affects the interpretability of topic models. We investigate the effects of aggregating short documents into larger ones based on natural units that partition the corpus. In our study, we analyze one million tweets by U.S. state legislators from April 2016 to September 2020. We find that for documents aggregated at the account level, topics are more associated with individual states than when using individual tweets. This finding is replicated with Wikipedia pages aggregated by birth cities, showing how document definitions can impact topic modeling results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anith Selvakumar, Manasa Bharadwaj</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular Indoor Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to reconstruct a 3D semantic occupancy map from a single RGB image of an indoor scene, inferring spatial layout and object categories from 2D image cues. The challenge of this task arises from the depth, scale, and shape ambiguities that emerge when transforming a 2D image into 3D space, particularly within the complex and often heavily occluded environments of indoor scenes. Current SSC methods often struggle with these ambiguities, resulting in distorted or missing object representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages novel view synthesis and multiview fusion. Specifically, we demonstrate how virtual cameras can be placed around the scene to emulate multiview inputs that enhance contextual scene information. We also introduce a Multiview Fusion Adaptor (MVFA) to effectively combine the multiview 3D scene predictions into a unified 3D semantic occupancy map. Finally, we identify and study the inherent limitation of generative techniques when applied to SSC, specifically the Novelty-Consistency tradeoff. Our system, GenFuSE, demonstrates IoU score improvements of up to 2.8% for Scene Completion and 4.9% for Semantic Scene Completion when integrated with existing SSC networks on the NYUv2 dataset. This work introduces GenFuSE as a standard framework for advancing monocular SSC with synthesized inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr M. Suder, Eric Laber</p>
<p>Abstract: Information-directed sampling (IDS) is a powerful framework for solving bandit problems which has shown strong results in both Bayesian and frequentist settings. However, frequentist IDS, like many other bandit algorithms, requires that one have prior knowledge of a (relatively) tight upper bound on the norm of the true parameter vector governing the reward model in order to achieve good performance. Unfortunately, this requirement is rarely satisfied in practice. As we demonstrate, using a poorly calibrated bound can lead to significant regret accumulation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel frequentist IDS algorithm that iteratively refines a high-probability upper bound on the true parameter norm using accumulating data. We focus on the linear bandit setting with heteroskedastic subgaussian noise. Our method leverages a mixture of relevant information gain criteria to balance exploration aimed at tightening the estimated parameter norm bound and directly searching for the optimal action. We establish regret bounds for our algorithm that do not depend on an initially assumed parameter norm bound and demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art IDS and UCB algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently DeepSeek R1 demonstrated how reinforcement learning with simple rule-based incentives can enable autonomous development of complex reasoning in large language models, characterized by the "aha moment", in which the model manifest self-reflection and increased response length during training. However, attempts to extend this success to multimodal reasoning often failed to reproduce these key characteristics. In this report, we present the first successful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal reasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying reinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and exceeding both SFT setting by ~2%. In addition, we share our failed attempts and insights in attempting to achieve R1-like reasoning using RL with instruct models. aiming to shed light on the challenges involved. Our key observations include: (1) applying RL on instruct model often results in trivial reasoning trajectories, and (2) naive length reward are ineffective in eliciting reasoning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Wang, Zijie Yu, Rui Ye, Jianqing Zhang, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile agents have attracted tremendous research participation recently. Traditional approaches to mobile agent training rely on centralized data collection, leading to high cost and limited scalability. Distributed training utilizing federated learning offers an alternative by harnessing real-world user data, providing scalability and reducing costs. However, pivotal challenges, including the absence of standardized benchmarks, hinder progress in this field.
  To tackle the challenges, we introduce FedMABench, the first benchmark for federated training and evaluation of mobile agents, specifically designed for heterogeneous scenarios. FedMABench features 6 datasets with 30+ subsets, 8 federated algorithms, 10+ base models, and over 800 apps across 5 categories, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating mobile agents across diverse environments. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: federated algorithms consistently outperform local training; the distribution of specific apps plays a crucial role in heterogeneity; and, even apps from distinct categories can exhibit correlations during training.

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a new methodology for parameterized constrained robust optimization, an important class of optimization problems under uncertainty, based on learning with a self-supervised penalty-based loss function. Whereas supervised learning requires pre-solved instances for training, our approach leverages a custom loss function derived from the exact penalty method in optimization to learn an approximation, typically defined by a neural network model, of the parameterized optimal solution mapping. Additionally, we adapt our approach to robust constrained combinatorial optimization problems by incorporating a surrogate linear cost over mixed integer domains, and a smooth approximations thereof, into the final layer of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments to test our approach on three different applications: multidimensional knapsack with continuous variables, combinatorial multidimensional knapsack with discrete variables, and an inventory management problem. Our results demonstrate that our self-supervised approach is able to effectively learn neural network approximations whose inference time is significantly smaller than the computation time of traditional solvers for this class of robust optimization problems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that by varying the penalty parameter we are able to effectively balance the trade-off between sub-optimality and robust feasibility of the obtained solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in their intermediate outputs, which increases computational overhead. We introduce Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a novel prompting framework that combines cognitive-inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to minimize token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy.

Through comprehensive evaluation across 15 reasoning datasets with multiple languages and multimodal scenarios, we demonstrate that SoT achieves token reductions of 76% with negligible accuracy impact. In certain domains like mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens.

<p>Abstract: Traffic simulation, complementing real-world data with a long-tail distribution, allows for effective evaluation and enhancement of the ability of autonomous vehicles to handle accident-prone scenarios. Simulating such safety-critical scenarios is nontrivial, however, from log data that are typically regular scenarios, especially in consideration of dynamic adversarial interactions between the future motions of autonomous vehicles and surrounding traffic participants. To address it, this paper proposes an innovative and efficient strategy, termed IntSim, that explicitly decouples the driving intentions of surrounding actors from their motion planning for realistic and efficient safety-critical simulation. We formulate the adversarial transfer of driving intention as an optimization problem, facilitating extensive exploration of diverse attack behaviors and efficient solution convergence. Simultaneously, intention-conditioned motion planning benefits from powerful deep models and large-scale real-world data, permitting the simulation of realistic motion behaviors for actors. Specially, through adapting driving intentions based on environments, IntSim facilitates the flexible realization of dynamic adversarial interactions with autonomous vehicles. Finally, extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments on real-world datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that the proposed IntSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulating realistic safety-critical scenarios and further improves planners in handling such scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Liu, Yu Fang, Zhouhan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-to-speech (V2S) synthesis, the task of generating speech directly from silent video input, is inherently more challenging than other speech synthesis tasks due to the need to accurately reconstruct both speech content and speaker characteristics from visual cues alone. Recently, audio-visual pre-training has eliminated the need for additional acoustic hints in V2S, which previous methods often relied on to ensure training convergence. However, even with pre-training, existing methods continue to face challenges in achieving a balance between acoustic intelligibility and the preservation of speaker-specific characteristics. We analyzed this limitation and were motivated to introduce DiVISe (Direct Visual-Input Speech Synthesis), an end-to-end V2S model that predicts Mel-spectrograms directly from video frames alone. Despite not taking any acoustic hints, DiVISe effectively preserves speaker characteristics in the generated audio, and achieves superior performance on both objective and subjective metrics across the LRS2 and LRS3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that DiVISe not only outperforms existing V2S models in acoustic intelligibility but also scales more effectively with increased data and model parameters.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models serve as powerful tools for threat detection and mitigation; however, they also introduce potential new risks. Adversarial input can exploit these models through standard interfaces, thus creating new attack pathways that threaten critical network operations. As ML advancements progress, adversarial strategies become more advanced, and conventional defenses such as adversarial training are costly in computational terms and often fail to provide real-time detection. These methods typically require a balance between robustness and model performance, which presents challenges for applications that demand instant response. To further investigate this vulnerability, we suggest a novel strategy for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This approach is evaluated in real time within intrusion detection systems (IDS), leading to the development of a zero-touch mitigation strategy. Additionally, we explore various scenarios in the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework, emphasizing the critical need for enhanced mitigation techniques to strengthen IDS defenses against advanced threats and implement a zero-touch mitigation solution. Extensive testing across different scenarios in the RRC layer of the O-RAN infrastructure validates the ability of the framework to detect and counteract integrated RRC-layer attacks when paired with adversarial strategies, emphasizing the essential need for robust defensive mechanisms to strengthen IDS against complex threats.</p>

By integrating multi-task learning with streamlined network designs, it achieves more robust performance than conventional approaches, while maintaining compatibility with varying sensor configurations and action spaces. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on seven manipulation tasks. Notably, Diffusion-based models trained in our framework demonstrated superior performance and generalizability compared to the LeRobot framework, achieving performance improvements across diverse robotic platforms and environmental conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite their outstanding performance in the majority of scenarios, contemporary language models still occasionally generate undesirable outputs, for example, hallucinated text. While such behaviors have previously been linked to uncertainty, there is a notable lack of methods that actively consider uncertainty during text generation. In this work, we show how Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which selects model generations according to an expected risk, can be generalized into a principled uncertainty-aware decoding method. In short, we account for model uncertainty during decoding by incorporating a posterior over model parameters into MBR's computation of expected risk. We show that this modified expected risk is useful for both choosing outputs and deciding when to abstain from generation and can provide improvements without incurring overhead. We benchmark different methods for learning posteriors and show that performance improves with prediction diversity. We release our code publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Gruffaz, Josua Sassen</p>
<p>Abstract: Riemannian metric learning is an emerging field in machine learning, unlocking new ways to encode complex data structures beyond traditional distance metric learning. While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushil Mahavir Varma, Ir\`ene Waldspurger, Laurent Massouli\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the performance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment contexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly used static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits rarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for generative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system safety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable insights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields, including transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In particular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable to real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation institutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline a concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Algorithmic hate speech detection faces significant challenges due to the diverse definitions and datasets used in research and practice. Social media platforms, legal frameworks, and institutions each apply distinct yet overlapping definitions, complicating classification efforts. This study addresses these challenges by demonstrating that existing datasets and taxonomies can be integrated into a unified model, enhancing prediction performance and reducing reliance on multiple specialized classifiers. The work introduces a universal taxonomy and a hate speech classifier capable of detecting a wide range of definitions within a single framework. Our approach is validated by combining two widely used but differently annotated datasets, showing improved classification performance on an independent test set. This work highlights the potential of dataset and taxonomy integration in advancing hate speech detection, increasing efficiency, and ensuring broader applicability across contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Zhang, Alexandre Bousse, Laetitia Imbert, Song Xue, Kuangyu Shi, Julien Bert</p>
<p>Abstract: Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a modern strategy in radiation oncology that aims to administer a potent radiation dose specifically to cancer cells using cancer-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. Accurate radiation dose estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning, particularly with pre-therapy imaging, holds promise for personalizing TRT doses. However, current methods require large time series of SPECT imaging, which is hardly achievable in routine clinical practice, and thus raises issues of data availability. Our objective is to develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) solution to personalize dosimetry using pre-therapy images. The aim is to develop an approach that achieves accurate results when PET/CT images are available, but are associated with only a few post-therapy dosimetry data provided by SPECT images. In this work, we introduce an SSL method using a pseudo-label generation approach for regression tasks inspired by the FixMatch framework. The feasibility of the proposed solution was preliminarily evaluated through an in-silico study using synthetic data and Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results for organ dose prediction yielded promising outcomes, showing that the use of pseudo-labeled data provides better accuracy compared to using only labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abedulgader Baktheer, Fadi Aldakheel</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate lifetime prediction of structures subjected to cyclic loading is vital, especially in scenarios involving non-uniform loading histories where load sequencing critically influences structural durability. Addressing this complexity requires advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing the intricate relationship between loading sequences and fatigue lifetime. Traditional fatigue simulations are computationally prohibitive, necessitating more efficient methods. This study highlights the potential of physics-based machine learning ($\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials. Specifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from experimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction accuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically based anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens tested in uniaxial compression. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in situations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of damage accumulation. Thus, a general algorithm is developed and successfully applied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with multiple loading ranges. Hereby, the $\phi$ML model serves as a surrogate to capture damage evolution across load transitions. The $\phi$ML based algorithm is subsequently employed to investigate the influence of multiple loading transitions on accumulated fatigue life, and its predictions align with trends observed in recent experimental studies. This work demonstrates $\phi$ML as a promising technique for efficient and reliable fatigue life prediction in engineering structures, with possible integration into digital twin models for real-time assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Run He, Di Fang, Yicheng Xu, Yawen Cui, Ming Li, Cen Chen, Ziqian Zeng, Huiping Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nizo Jaman Shohan, Gazi Tanbhir, Faria Elahi, Ahsan Ullah, Md. Nazmus Sakib</p>
<p>Abstract: The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack stands out as a highly formidable cyber threat, representing an advanced form of the denial-of-service (DoS) attack. A DDoS attack involves multiple computers working together to overwhelm a system, making it unavailable. On the other hand, a DoS attack is a one-on-one attempt to make a system or website inaccessible. Thus, it is crucial to construct an effective model for identifying various DDoS incidents. Although extensive research has focused on binary detection models for DDoS identification, they face challenges to adapt evolving threats, necessitating frequent updates. Whereas multiclass detection models offer a comprehensive defense against diverse DDoS attacks, ensuring adaptability in the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Model to strengthen network security by combining the featureextraction abilities of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the classification skills of Random Forest (RF) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers. Using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, we perform multiclass classification of various DDoS attacks and conduct a comparative analysis of evaluation metrics for RF, MLP, and our proposed Hybrid Model. After analyzing the results, we draw meaningful conclusions and confirm the superiority of our Hybrid Model by performing thorough cross-validation. Additionally, we integrate our machine learning model with Snort, which provides a robust and adaptive solution for detecting and mitigating various DDoS attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christofer Fellicious, Hans P. Reiser, Michael Granitzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Forensic Memory Analysis (FMA) and Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) are critical tools for security in a virtualization-based approach. VMI and FMA involves using digital forensic methods to extract information from the system to identify and explain security incidents. A key challenge in both FMA and VMI is the "Semantic Gap", which is the difficulty of interpreting raw memory data without specialized tools and expertise. In this work, we investigate how a priori knowledge, metadata and engineered features can aid VMI and FMA, leveraging machine learning to automate information extraction and reduce the workload of forensic investigators. We choose OpenSSH as our use case to test different methods to extract high level structures. We also test our method on complete physical memory dumps to showcase the effectiveness of the engineered features. Our features range from basic statistical features to advanced graph-based representations using malloc headers and pointer translations. The training and testing are carried out on public datasets that we compare against already recognized baseline methods. We show that using metadata, we can improve the performance of the algorithm when there is very little training data and also quantify how having more data results in better generalization performance. The final contribution is an open dataset of physical memory dumps, totalling more than 1 TB of different memory state, software environments, main memory capacities and operating system versions. Our methods show that having more metadata boosts performance with all methods obtaining an F1-Score of over 80%. Our research underscores the possibility of using feature engineering and machine learning techniques to bridge the semantic gap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romain Hermary, Vincent Gaudilli\`ere, Abd El Rahman Shabayek, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: One-class anomaly detection aims to detect objects that do not belong to a predefined normal class. In practice training data lack those anomalous samples; hence state-of-the-art methods are trained to discriminate between normal and synthetically-generated pseudo-anomalous data. Most methods use data augmentation techniques on normal images to simulate anomalies. However the best-performing ones implicitly leverage a geometric bias present in the benchmarking datasets. This limits their usability in more general conditions. Others are relying on basic noising schemes that may be suboptimal in capturing the underlying structure of normal data. In addition most still favour the image domain to generate pseudo-anomalies training models end-to-end from only the normal class and overlooking richer representations of the information. To overcome these limitations we consider frozen yet rich feature spaces given by pretrained models and create pseudo-anomalous features with a novel adaptive linear feature perturbation technique. It adapts the noise distribution to each sample applies decaying linear perturbations to feature vectors and further guides the classification process using a contrastive learning objective. Experimental evaluation conducted on both standard and geometric bias-free datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach with respect to comparable baselines. The codebase is accessible via our public repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eren Erogullari, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Frederik Pahde</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are widely used to model human-understandable concepts as directions within the latent space of neural networks. They are trained by identifying directions from the activations of concept samples to those of non-concept samples. However, this method often produces similar, non-orthogonal directions for correlated concepts, such as "beard" and "necktie" within the CelebA dataset, which frequently co-occur in images of men. This entanglement complicates the interpretation of concepts in isolation and can lead to undesired effects in CAV applications, such as activation steering. To address this issue, we introduce a post-hoc concept disentanglement method that employs a non-orthogonality loss, facilitating the identification of orthogonal concept directions while preserving directional correctness. We evaluate our approach with real-world and controlled correlated concepts in CelebA and a synthetic FunnyBirds dataset with VGG16 and ResNet18 architectures. We further demonstrate the superiority of orthogonalized concept representations in activation steering tasks, allowing (1) the insertion of isolated concepts into input images through generative models and (2) the removal of concepts for effective shortcut suppression with reduced impact on correlated concepts in comparison to baseline CAVs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergei I. Simak, Erna K. Delczeg-Czirjak, Olle Eriksson</p>
<p>Abstract: The predictive accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) for alloy formation enthalpies is often limited by intrinsic energy resolution errors, particularly in ternary phase stability calculations. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to systematically correct these errors, improving the reliability of first-principles predictions. A neural network model has been trained to predict the discrepancy between DFT-calculated and experimentally measured enthalpies for binary and ternary alloys and compounds. The model utilizes a structured feature set comprising elemental concentrations, atomic numbers, and interaction terms to capture key chemical and structural effects. By applying supervised learning and rigorous data curation we ensure a robust and physically meaningful correction. The model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor with three hidden layers, optimized through leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and k-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to the Al-Ni-Pd and Al-Ni-Ti systems, which are of interest for high-temperature applications in aerospace and protective coatings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, reducing reliance on expensive vector database lookups. We evaluate Proximity on the MMLU and MedRAG benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining response accuracy. Proximity reduces retrieval latency by up to 59% while maintaining accuracy and lowers the computational burden on the vector database. We also experiment with different similarity thresholds and quantify the trade-off between speed and recall. Our work shows that approximate caching is a viable and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where data efficiency and robustness are critical. Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) experiments are a cornerstone for materials structure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing pXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a bottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning promises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction analysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is the lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained researchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on simulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns, particularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and elevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction Database (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and unlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental data, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected \numpatterns diffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving materials labs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robustness has become a critical attribute for the deployment of RAG systems in real-world applications. Existing research focuses on robustness to explicit noise (e.g., document semantics) but overlooks spurious features (a.k.a. implicit noise). While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs, they are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios (e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious features in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through controlled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features are harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes. Extensive evaluation results across multiple LLMs suggest that spurious features are a widespread and challenging problem in the field of RAG. The code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Fl\'orez Ablan, Marco Roth, Jan Schnabel</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum kernels (QK) are widely used in quantum machine learning applications; yet, their potential to surpass classical machine learning methods on classical datasets remains uncertain. This limitation can be attributed to the exponential concentration phenomenon, which can impair both trainability and generalization. A common strategy to alleviate this is bandwidth tuning, which involves rescaling data points in the quantum model to improve generalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that optimal bandwidth tuning results in QKs that closely resemble radial basis function (RBF) kernels, leading to a lack of quantum advantage over classical methods. Moreover, we reveal that the size of optimal bandwidth tuning parameters further simplifies QKs, causing them to behave like polynomial kernels, corresponding to a low-order Taylor approximation of a RBF kernel. We thoroughly investigate this for fidelity quantum kernels and projected quantum kernels using various data encoding circuits across several classification datasets. We provide numerical evidence and derive a simple analytical model that elucidates how bandwidth tuning influences key quantities in classification tasks. Overall, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that render QK methods classically simulatable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Mossina, Corentin Friedrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Image segmentation is a challenging task influenced by multiple sources of uncertainty, such as the data labeling process or the sampling of training data. In this paper we focus on binary segmentation and address these challenges using conformal prediction, a family of model- and data-agnostic methods for uncertainty quantification that provide finite-sample theoretical guarantees and applicable to any pretrained predictor. Our approach involves computing nonconformity scores, a type of prediction residual, on held-out calibration data not used during training. We use dilation, one of the fundamental operations in mathematical morphology, to construct a margin added to the borders of predicted segmentation masks. At inference, the predicted set formed by the mask and its margin contains the ground-truth mask with high probability, at a confidence level specified by the user. The size of the margin serves as an indicator of predictive uncertainty for a given model and dataset. We work in a regime of minimal information as we do not require any feedback from the predictor: only the predicted masks are needed for computing the prediction sets. Hence, our method is applicable to any segmentation model, including those based on deep learning; we evaluate our approach on several medical imaging applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Sukwon Yun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Tianlong Chen, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfan Jiang, Ruohan Zhang, Josiah Wong, Chen Wang, Yanjie Ze, Hang Yin, Cem Gokmen, Shuran Song, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile manipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We believe that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface, and learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world whole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Faw, Constantine Caramanis, Jessica Hoffmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Unconscious bias has been shown to influence how we assess our peers, with consequences for hiring, promotions and admissions. In this work, we focus on affinity bias, the component of unconscious bias which leads us to prefer people who are similar to us, despite no deliberate intention of favoritism. In a world where the people hired today become part of the hiring committee of tomorrow, we are particularly interested in understanding (and mitigating) how affinity bias affects this feedback loop. This problem has two distinctive features: 1) we only observe the biased value of a candidate, but we want to optimize with respect to their real value 2) the bias towards a candidate with a specific set of traits depends on the fraction of people in the hiring committee with the same set of traits. We introduce a new bandits variant that exhibits those two features, which we call affinity bandits. Unsurprisingly, classical algorithms such as UCB often fail to identify the best arm in this setting. We prove a new instance-dependent regret lower bound, which is larger than that in the standard bandit setting by a multiplicative function of $K$. Since we treat rewards that are time-varying and dependent on the policy's past actions, deriving this lower bound requires developing proof techniques beyond the standard bandit techniques. Finally, we design an elimination-style algorithm which nearly matches this regret, despite never observing the real rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengqun Zhao, Ziquan Liu, Yu Cao, Shaogang Gong, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Keeping large language models factually up-to-date is crucial for deployment, yet costly retraining remains a challenge. Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Louloudakis, Perry Gibson, Jos\'e Cano, Ajitha Rajan</p>
<p>Abstract: As the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on resource-intensive and safety-critical tasks increases, a variety of Machine Learning (ML) compilers have been developed, enabling compatibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with a variety of hardware acceleration devices. However, given that DNNs are widely utilized for challenging and demanding tasks, the behavior of these compilers must be verified. To this direction, we propose MutateNN, a tool that utilizes elements of both differential and mutation testing in order to examine the robustness of image recognition models when deployed on hardware accelerators with different capabilities, in the presence of faults in their target device code - introduced either by developers, or problems in their compilation process. We focus on the image recognition domain by applying mutation testing to 7 well-established DNN models, introducing 21 mutations of 6 different categories. We deployed our mutants on 4 different hardware acceleration devices of varying capabilities and observed that DNN models presented discrepancies of up to 90.3% in mutants related to conditional operators across devices. We also observed that mutations related to layer modification, arithmetic types and input affected severely the overall model performance (up to 99.8%) or led to model crashes, in a consistent manner across devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongjie Yi, Liwei Guo, Shiyun Wei, Ao Zhou, Shangguang Wang, Mengwei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPTs and Mixtral-8x7B have revolutionized machine intelligence due to their exceptional abilities in generic ML tasks. Transiting LLMs from datacenters to edge devices brings benefits like better privacy and availability, but is challenged by their massive parameter size and thus unbearable runtime costs. To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs -- a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline. On popular MoE LLMs and edge devices, EdgeMoE showcase significant memory savings and speedup over competitive baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/mllm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rakshitha Godahewa, Christoph Bergmeir, Zeynep Erkin Baz, Chengjun Zhu, Zhangdi Song, Salvador Garc\'ia, Dario Benavides</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasts are typically not produced in a vacuum but in a business context, where forecasts are generated on a regular basis and interact with each other. For decisions, it may be important that forecasts do not change arbitrarily, and are stable in some sense. However, this area has received only limited attention in the forecasting literature. In this paper, we explore two types of forecast stability that we call vertical stability and horizontal stability. The existing works in the literature are only applicable to certain base models and extending these frameworks to be compatible with any base model is not straightforward. Furthermore, these frameworks can only stabilise the forecasts vertically. To fill this gap, we propose a simple linear-interpolation-based approach that is applicable to stabilise the forecasts provided by any base model vertically and horizontally. The approach can produce both accurate and stable forecasts. Using N-BEATS, Pooled Regression and LightGBM as the base models, in our evaluation on four publicly available datasets, the proposed framework is able to achieve significantly higher stability and/or accuracy compared to a set of benchmarks including a state-of-the-art forecast stabilisation method across three error metrics and six stability metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Paz-Ruza, Amparo Alonso-Betanzos, Bertha Guijarro-Berdi\~nas, Brais Cancela, Carlos Eiras-Franco</p>
<p>Abstract: Dyadic regression models, which output real-valued predictions for pairs of entities, are fundamental in many domains (e.g. obtaining user-product ratings in Recommender Systems) and promising and under exploration in others (e.g. tuning patient-drug dosages in precision pharmacology). In this work, we prove that non-uniform observed value distributions of individual entities lead to severe biases in state-of-the-art models, skewing predictions towards the average of observed past values for the entity and providing worse-than-random predictive power in eccentric yet crucial cases; we name this phenomenon eccentricity bias. We show that global error metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are insufficient to capture this bias, and we introduce Eccentricity-Area Under the Curve (EAUC) as a novel metric that can quantify it in all studied domains and models. We prove the intuitive interpretation of EAUC by experimenting with naive post-training bias corrections, and theorize other options to use EAUC to guide the construction of fair models. This work contributes a bias-aware evaluation of dyadic regression to prevent unfairness in critical real-world applications of such systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We give quantitative estimates for the rate of convergence of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) to Riemannian gradient flow and to a diffusion process, the so-called Riemannian stochastic modified flow (RSMF). Using tools from stochastic differential geometry we show that, in the small learning rate regime, RSGD can be approximated by the solution to the RSMF driven by an infinite-dimensional Wiener process. The RSMF accounts for the random fluctuations of RSGD and, thereby, increases the order of approximation compared to the deterministic Riemannian gradient flow. The RSGD is build using the concept of a retraction map, that is, a cost efficient approximation of the exponential map, and we prove quantitative bounds for the weak error of the diffusion approximation under assumptions on the retraction map, the geometry of the manifold, and the random estimators of the gradient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zian Li, Xiyuan Wang, Shijia Kang, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under fully-connected conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Marius Lillelund, Fernando Pannullo, Morten Opprud Jakobsen, Manuel Morante, Christian Fischer Pedersen</p>
<p>Abstract: Censored data refers to situations where the full information about a particular event or process is only partially known. In survival analysis, censoring plays an important role, as ignoring such observations can bias the model parameters and overestimate the probability of when the event is likely to occur. There has been a renewed interest in using data-driven methods to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of ball bearings for predictive maintenance. However, few studies have explicitly addressed the challenge of handling censored data. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and flexible method for early fault detection using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and RUL estimation using survival analysis that naturally supports censored data. We demonstrate our approach in the XJTU-SY dataset using a 5-fold cross-validation across three different operating conditions. When predicting the time to failure for bearings under the highest load (C1, 12.0 kN and 2100 RPM) with 25\% random censoring, our approach achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.7 minutes (95\% CI 13.6-15.8) using a linear CoxPH model, and an MAE of 12.6 minutes (95\% CI 11.8-13.4) using a nonlinear Random Survival Forests model, compared to an MAE of 18.5 minutes (95\% 17.4-19.6) using a linear LASSO model that does not support censoring. Moreover, our approach achieves a mean cumulative relative accuracy (CRA) of 0.7586 over 5 bearings under the highest load, which improves over several state-of-the-art baselines. Our work highlights the importance of considering censored observations as part of the model design when building predictive models for early fault detection and RUL estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have been successful at tasks involving basic forms of in-context reasoning, such as generating coherent language, as well as storing vast amounts of knowledge. At the core of the Transformer architecture behind such models are feed-forward and attention layers, which are often associated to knowledge and reasoning, respectively. In this paper, we study this distinction empirically and theoretically in a controlled synthetic setting where certain next-token predictions involve both distributional and in-context information. We find that feed-forward layers tend to learn simple distributional associations such as bigrams, while attention layers focus on in-context reasoning. Our theoretical analysis identifies the noise in the gradients as a key factor behind this discrepancy. Finally, we illustrate how similar disparities emerge in pre-trained models through ablations on the Pythia model family on simple reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nachiket Kotalwar, Alkis Gotovos, Adish Singla</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhojyoti Mukherjee, Josiah P. Hanna, Qiaomin Xie, Robert Nowak</p>
<p>Abstract: We study learning to learn for the multi-task structured bandit problem where the goal is to learn a near-optimal algorithm that minimizes cumulative regret. The tasks share a common structure and an algorithm should exploit the shared structure to minimize the cumulative regret for an unseen but related test task. We use a transformer as a decision-making algorithm to learn this shared structure from data collected by a demonstrator on a set of training task instances. Our objective is to devise a training procedure such that the transformer will learn to outperform the demonstrator's learning algorithm on unseen test task instances. Prior work on pretraining decision transformers either requires privileged information like access to optimal arms or cannot outperform the demonstrator. Going beyond these approaches, we introduce a pre-training approach that trains a transformer network to learn a near-optimal policy in-context. This approach leverages the shared structure across tasks, does not require access to optimal actions, and can outperform the demonstrator. We validate these claims over a wide variety of structured bandit problems to show that our proposed solution is general and can quickly identify expected rewards on unseen test tasks to support effective exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dietary Restriction (DR) is one of the most popular anti-ageing interventions; recently, Machine Learning (ML) has been explored to identify potential DR-related genes among ageing-related genes, aiming to minimize costly wet lab experiments needed to expand our knowledge on DR. However, to train a model from positive (DR-related) and negative (non-DR-related) examples, the existing ML approach naively labels genes without known DR relation as negative examples, assuming that lack of DR-related annotation for a gene represents evidence of absence of DR-relatedness, rather than absence of evidence. This hinders the reliability of the negative examples (non-DR-related genes) and the method's ability to identify novel DR-related genes. This work introduces a novel gene prioritisation method based on the two-step Positive-Unlabelled (PU) Learning paradigm: using a similarity-based, KNN-inspired approach, our method first selects reliable negative examples among the genes without known DR associations. Then, these reliable negatives and all known positives are used to train a classifier that effectively differentiates DR-related and non-DR-related genes, which is finally employed to generate a more reliable ranking of promising genes for novel DR-relatedness. Our method significantly outperforms (p<0.05) the existing state-of-the-art approach in three predictive accuracy metrics with up to 40% lower computational cost in the best case, and we identify 4 new promising DR-related genes (PRKAB1, PRKAB2, IRS2, PRKAG1), all with evidence from the existing literature supporting their potential DR-related role.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amitoz Azad, Yuan Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Geodesic distances on manifolds have numerous applications in image processing, computer graphics and computer vision. In this work, we introduce an approach called `LGGD' (Learned Generalized Geodesic Distances). This method involves generating node features by learning a generalized geodesic distance function through a training pipeline that incorporates training data, graph topology and the node content features. The strength of this method lies in the proven robustness of the generalized geodesic distances to noise and outliers. Our contributions encompass improved performance in node classification tasks, competitive results with state-of-the-art methods on real-world graph datasets, the demonstration of the learnability of parameters within the generalized geodesic equation on graph, and dynamic inclusion of new labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vint Lee, Minh Nguyen, Leena Elzeiny, Chun Deng, Pieter Abbeel, John Wawrzynek</p>
<p>Abstract: Macro placement is a vital step in digital circuit design that defines the physical location of large collections of components, known as macros, on a 2D chip. Because key performance metrics of the chip are determined by the placement, optimizing it is crucial. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of their reliance on reinforcement learning (RL), which is slow and struggles to generalize, requiring online training on each new circuit. Instead, we train a diffusion model capable of placing new circuits zero-shot, using guided sampling in lieu of RL to optimize placement quality. To enable such models to train at scale, we designed a capable yet efficient architecture for the denoising model, and propose a novel algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets for pre-training. To allow zero-shot transfer to real circuits, we empirically study the design decisions of our dataset generation algorithm, and identify several key factors enabling generalization. When trained on our synthetic data, our models generate high-quality placements on unseen, realistic circuits, achieving competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Bini, Marco Sorbi, Stephane Marchand-Maillet</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for effectively modeling graph-structured data, and attention mechanisms have been pivotal in enabling these models to capture complex patterns. In our study, we reveal a critical yet underexplored consequence of integrating attention into edge-featured GNNs: the emergence of Massive Activations (MAs) within attention layers. By developing a novel method for detecting MAs on edge features, we show that these extreme activations are not only activation anomalies but encode domain-relevant signals. Our post-hoc interpretability analysis demonstrates that, in molecular graphs, MAs aggregate predominantly on common bond types (e.g., single and double bonds) while sparing more informative ones (e.g., triple bonds). Furthermore, our ablation studies confirm that MAs can serve as natural attribution indicators, reallocating to less informative edges. Our study assesses various edge-featured attention-based GNN models using benchmark datasets, including ZINC, TOX21, and PROTEINS. Key contributions include (1) establishing the direct link between attention mechanisms and MAs generation in edge-featured GNNs, (2) developing a robust definition and detection method for MAs enabling reliable post-hoc interpretability. Overall, our study reveals the complex interplay between attention mechanisms, edge-featured GNNs model, and MAs emergence, providing crucial insights for relating GNNs internals to domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Debeshee Das, Gautam Kamath, Florian Tram\`er</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of a training data proof, where a data creator or owner wants to demonstrate to a third party that some machine learning model was trained on their data. Training data proofs play a key role in recent lawsuits against foundation models trained on web-scale data. Many prior works suggest to instantiate training data proofs using membership inference attacks. We argue that this approach is fundamentally unsound: to provide convincing evidence, the data creator needs to demonstrate that their attack has a low false positive rate, i.e., that the attack's output is unlikely under the null hypothesis that the model was not trained on the target data. Yet, sampling from this null hypothesis is impossible, as we do not know the exact contents of the training set, nor can we (efficiently) retrain a large foundation model. We conclude by offering two paths forward, by showing that data extraction attacks and membership inference on special canary data can be used to create sound training data proofs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaushik Roy, Akila Dissanayake, Brendan Tidd, Peyman Moghadam</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02970">F-Fidelity: A Robust Framework for Faithfulness Evaluation of Explainable AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zheng, Farhad Shirani, Zhuomin Chen, Chaohao Lin, Wei Cheng, Wenbo Guo, Dongsheng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has developed a number of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as gradient-based approaches, input perturbation-base methods, and black-box explanation methods. While these XAI techniques can extract meaningful insights from deep learning models, how to properly evaluate them remains an open problem. The most widely used approach is to perturb or even remove what the XAI method considers to be the most important features in an input and observe the changes in the output prediction. This approach, although straightforward, suffers the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem as the perturbed samples may no longer follow the original data distribution. A recent method RemOve And Retrain (ROAR) solves the OOD issue by retraining the model with perturbed samples guided by explanations. However, using the model retrained based on XAI methods to evaluate these explainers may cause information leakage and thus lead to unfair comparisons. We propose Fine-tuned Fidelity (F-Fidelity), a robust evaluation framework for XAI, which utilizes i) an explanation-agnostic fine-tuning strategy, thus mitigating the information leakage issue, and ii) a random masking operation that ensures that the removal step does not generate an OOD input. We also design controlled experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainers and their degraded version to verify the correctness of our framework. We conduct experiments on multiple data modalities, such as images, time series, and natural language. The results demonstrate that F-Fidelity significantly improves upon prior evaluation metrics in recovering the ground-truth ranking of the explainers. Furthermore, we show both theoretically and empirically that, given a faithful explainer, F-Fidelity metric can be used to compute the sparsity of influential input components, i.e., to extract the true explanation size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thieu N Vo, Tung D. Pham, Xin T. Tong, Tan Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective state space models (SSM), such as Mamba, have gained prominence for their effectiveness in modeling sequential data. Despite their outstanding empirical performance, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of deep selective SSM remains elusive, hindering their further development and adoption for applications that need high fidelity. In this paper, we investigate the dynamical properties of tokens in a pre-trained Mamba model. In particular, we derive the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the Mamba model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. In the one-dimensional case, we prove that only one of the following two scenarios happens: either all tokens converge to zero, or all tokens diverge to infinity. We provide criteria based on model parameters to determine when each scenario occurs. For the convergent scenario, we empirically verify that this scenario negatively impacts the model's performance. For the divergent scenario, we prove that different tokens will diverge to infinity at different rates, thereby contributing unequally to the updates during model training. Based on these investigations, we propose two refinements for the model: excluding the convergent scenario and reordering tokens based on their importance scores, both aimed at improving practical performance. Our experimental results validate these refinements, offering insights into enhancing Mamba's effectiveness in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing preference optimization methods often assume scenarios where paired preference feedback (preferred/positive vs. dis-preferred/negative examples) is available. This requirement limits their applicability in scenarios where only unpaired feedback--for example, either positive or negative--is available. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that decouples learning from positive and negative feedback. This decoupling enables control over the influence of each feedback type and, importantly, allows learning even when only one feedback type is present. A key contribution is demonstrating stable learning from negative feedback alone, a capability not well-addressed by current methods. Our approach builds upon the probabilistic framework introduced in (Dayan and Hinton, 1997), which uses expectation-maximization (EM) to directly optimize the probability of positive outcomes (as opposed to classic expected reward maximization). We address a key limitation in current EM-based methods: they solely maximize the likelihood of positive examples, while neglecting negative ones. We show how to extend EM algorithms to explicitly incorporate negative examples, leading to a theoretically grounded algorithm that offers an intuitive and versatile way to learn from both positive and negative feedback. We evaluate our approach for training language models based on human feedback as well as training policies for sequential decision-making problems, where learned value functions are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet-Hoang Tran, Thieu N. Vo, An Nguyen The, Tho Tran Huu, Minh-Khoi Nguyen-Nhat, Thanh Tran, Duy-Tung Pham, Tan Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper systematically explores neural functional networks (NFN) for transformer architectures. NFN are specialized neural networks that treat the weights, gradients, or sparsity patterns of a deep neural network (DNN) as input data and have proven valuable for tasks such as learnable optimizers, implicit data representations, and weight editing. While NFN have been extensively developed for MLP and CNN, no prior work has addressed their design for transformers, despite the importance of transformers in modern deep learning. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a systematic study of NFN for transformers. We first determine the maximal symmetric group of the weights in a multi-head attention module as well as a necessary and sufficient condition under which two sets of hyperparameters of the multi-head attention module define the same function. We then define the weight space of transformer architectures and its associated group action, which leads to the design principles for NFN in transformers. Based on these, we introduce Transformer-NFN, an NFN that is equivariant under this group action. Additionally, we release a dataset of more than 125,000 Transformers model checkpoints trained on two datasets with two different tasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating Transformer-NFN and encouraging further research on transformer training and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Qin, Manuel Madeira, Dorina Thanou, Pascal Frossard</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph generative models are essential across diverse scientific domains by capturing complex distributions over relational data. Among them, graph diffusion models achieve superior performance but face inefficient sampling and limited flexibility due to the tight coupling between training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a novel graph generative framework that disentangles sampling from training, enabling a broader design space for more effective and efficient model optimization. DeFoG employs a discrete flow-matching formulation that respects the inherent symmetries of graphs. We theoretically ground this disentangled formulation by explicitly relating the training loss to the sampling algorithm and showing that DeFoG faithfully replicates the ground truth graph distribution. Building on these foundations, we thoroughly investigate DeFoG's design space and propose novel sampling methods that significantly enhance performance and reduce the required number of refinement steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across synthetic, molecular, and digital pathology datasets, covering both unconditional and conditional generation settings. It also outperforms most diffusion-based models with just 5-10% of their sampling steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: The well-known generalization problem hinders the application of artificial neural networks in continuous-time prediction tasks with varying latent dynamics. In sharp contrast, biological systems can neatly adapt to evolving environments benefiting from real-time feedback mechanisms. Inspired by the feedback philosophy, we present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement. The feedback neural network is a novel two-DOF neural network, which possesses robust performance in unseen scenarios with no loss of accuracy performance on previous tasks.} A linear feedback form is presented to correct the learned latent dynamics firstly, with a convergence guarantee. Then, domain randomization is utilized to learn a nonlinear neural feedback form. Finally, extensive tests including trajectory prediction of a real irregular object and model predictive control of a quadrotor with various uncertainties, are implemented, indicating significant improvements over state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Wahl, Armand Rousselot, Felix Draxler, Henrik Schopmans, Ullrich K\"othe</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling distributions that depend on external control parameters is a common scenario in diverse applications like molecular simulations, where system properties like temperature affect molecular configurations. Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on energy-based training, which is prone to instability. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d.~samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Acevedo, Alex Rodriguez, Alessandro Laio</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world data, information is stored in extremely large feature vectors. These variables are typically correlated due to complex interactions involving many features simultaneously. Such correlations qualitatively correspond to semantic roles and are naturally recognized by both the human brain and artificial neural networks. This recognition enables, for instance, the prediction of missing parts of an image or text based on their context. We present a method to detect these correlations in high-dimensional data represented as binary numbers. We estimate the binary intrinsic dimension of a dataset, which quantifies the minimum number of independent coordinates needed to describe the data, and is therefore a proxy of semantic complexity. The proposed algorithm is largely insensitive to the so-called curse of dimensionality, and can therefore be used in big data analysis. We test this approach identifying phase transitions in model magnetic systems and we then apply it to the detection of semantic correlations of images and text inside deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md-Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme resource constraints make large-scale machine learning (ML) with distributed clients challenging in wireless networks. On the one hand, large-scale ML requires massive information exchange between clients and server(s). On the other hand, these clients have limited battery and computation powers that are often dedicated to operational computations. Split federated learning (SFL) is emerging as a potential solution to mitigate these challenges, by splitting the ML model into client-side and server-side model blocks, where only the client-side block is trained on the client device. However, practical applications require personalized models that are suitable for the client's personal task. Motivated by this, we propose a personalized hierarchical split federated learning (PHSFL) algorithm that is specially designed to achieve better personalization performance. More specially, owing to the fact that regardless of the severity of the statistical data distributions across the clients, many of the features have similar attributes, we only train the body part of the federated learning (FL) model while keeping the (randomly initialized) classifier frozen during the training phase. We first perform extensive theoretical analysis to understand the impact of model splitting and hierarchical model aggregations on the global model. Once the global model is trained, we fine-tune each client classifier to obtain the personalized models. Our empirical findings suggest that while the globally trained model with the untrained classifier performs quite similarly to other existing solutions, the fine-tuned models show significantly improved personalized performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that fine-tuning diffusion models (DMs) with arbitrary rewards, including non-differentiable ones, is feasible with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, enabling flexible model alignment. However, applying existing RL methods to timestep-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for efficient reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and specifically targets image generation $\le2$ steps for reward optimization, enhancing generalizability and efficiency. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including PPO and DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/lasro.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions within scientific machine learning models by introducing innovative temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. Despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps (a 7:1 prediction-to-training ratio) achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions that shows potential for mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Gong, Akshat Kumar, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-term time series analysis aims to forecast long-term trends by examining changes over past and future periods. The intricacy of time series data poses significant challenges for modeling. Models based on the Transformer architecture, through the application of attention mechanisms to channels and sequences, have demonstrated notable performance advantages. In contrast, methods based on convolutional neural networks or linear models often struggle to effectively handle scenarios with large number of channels. However, our research reveals that the attention mechanism is not the core component responsible for performance enhancement. We have designed an exceedingly simple linear structure AverageLinear. By employing straightforward channel embedding and averaging operations, this model can effectively capture correlations between channels while maintaining a lightweight architecture. Experimentss on real-world datasets shows that AverageLinear matches or even surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer-based structures in performance. This indicates that using purely linear structures can also endow models with robust predictive power.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochuan Zhang, Chunhua Yang, Jie Han, Liyang Qin, Xiaoli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal language model has made advanced progress in vision and audio, but still faces significant challenges in dealing with complex reasoning tasks in the time series domain. The reasons are twofold. First, labels for multi-modal time series data are coarse and devoid of analysis or reasoning processes. Training with these data cannot improve the model's reasoning capabilities. Second, due to the lack of precise tokenization in processing time series, the representation patterns for temporal and textual information are inconsistent, which hampers the effectiveness of multi-modal alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal time series data construction approach and a multi-modal time series language model (TLM), TempoGPT. Specially, we construct multi-modal data for complex reasoning tasks by analyzing the variable-system relationships within a white-box system. Additionally, proposed TempoGPT achieves consistent representation between temporal and textual information by quantizing temporal embeddings, where temporal embeddings are quantized into a series of discrete tokens using a predefined codebook; subsequently, a shared embedding layer processes both temporal and textual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoGPT accurately perceives temporal information, logically infers conclusions, and achieves state-of-the-art in the constructed complex time series reasoning tasks. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of quantizing temporal embeddings in enhancing multi-modal alignment and the reasoning capabilities of TLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanghaochuan20/TempoGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Baheri, Zahra Shahrooei, Chirayu Salgarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic (WAVE), an approach to enhance stability in deep reinforcement learning through adaptive Wasserstein regularization. Our method addresses the inherent instability of actor-critic algorithms by incorporating an adaptively weighted Wasserstein regularization term into the critic's loss function. We prove that WAVE achieves $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ convergence rate for the critic's mean squared error and provide theoretical guarantees for stability through Wasserstein-based regularization. Using the Sinkhorn approximation for computational efficiency, our approach automatically adjusts the regularization based on the agent's performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WAVE achieves superior performance compared to standard actor-critic methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Wu, Hongming Piao, Long-Kai Huang, Renzhen Wang, Wanhua Li, Hanspeter Pfister, Deyu Meng, Kede Ma, Ying Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) with foundation models has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to exploit abundant knowledge acquired during pre-training for tackling sequential tasks. However, existing prompt-based and Low-Rank Adaptation-based (LoRA-based) methods often require expanding a prompt/LoRA pool or retaining samples of previous tasks, which poses significant scalability challenges as the number of tasks grows. To address these limitations, we propose Scalable Decoupled LoRA (SD-LoRA) for class incremental learning, which continually separates the learning of the magnitude and direction of LoRA components without rehearsal. Our empirical and theoretical analysis reveals that SD-LoRA tends to follow a low-loss trajectory and converges to an overlapping low-loss region for all learned tasks, resulting in an excellent stability-plasticity trade-off. Building upon these insights, we introduce two variants of SD-LoRA with further improved parameter efficiency. All parameters of SD-LoRAs can be end-to-end optimized for CL objectives. Meanwhile, they support efficient inference by allowing direct evaluation with the finally trained model, obviating the need for component selection. Extensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks and foundation models consistently validate the effectiveness of SD-LoRA. The code is available at https://github.com/WuYichen-97/SD-Lora-CL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsha Chamara Hewage, Bahman Rostami-Tabar, Aris Syntetos, Federico Liberatore, Glenn Milano</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is vital for ensuring reliable access to contraceptive products, supporting key processes like procurement, inventory, and distribution. However, forecasting contraceptive demand in developing countries presents challenges, including incomplete data, poor data quality, and the need to account for multiple geographical and product factors. Current methods often rely on simple forecasting techniques, which fail to capture demand uncertainties arising from these factors, warranting expert involvement. Our study aims to improve contraceptive demand forecasting by combining probabilistic forecasting methods with expert knowledge. We developed a hybrid model that combines point forecasts from domain-specific model with probabilistic distributions from statistical and machine learning approaches, enabling human input to fine-tune and enhance the system-generated forecasts. This approach helps address the uncertainties in demand and is particularly useful in resource-limited settings. We evaluate different forecasting methods, including time series, Bayesian, machine learning, and foundational time series methods alongside our new hybrid approach. By comparing these methods, we provide insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and computational requirements. Our research fills a gap in forecasting contraceptive demand and offers a practical framework that combines algorithmic and human expertise. Our proposed model can also be generalized to other humanitarian contexts with similar data patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Siems, Timur Carstensen, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil, Riccardo Grazzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Hong, Yongli Xiang, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decades, researchers have primarily focused on improving the generalization abilities of models, with limited attention given to regulating such generalization. However, the ability of models to generalize to unintended data (e.g., harmful or unauthorized data) can be exploited by malicious adversaries in unforeseen ways, potentially resulting in violations of model ethics. Non-transferable learning (NTL), a task aimed at reshaping the generalization abilities of deep learning models, was proposed to address these challenges. While numerous methods have been proposed in this field, a comprehensive review of existing progress and a thorough analysis of current limitations remain lacking. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive survey on NTL and introducing NTLBench, the first benchmark to evaluate NTL performance and robustness within a unified framework. Specifically, we first introduce the task settings, general framework, and criteria of NTL, followed by a summary of NTL approaches. Furthermore, we emphasize the often-overlooked issue of robustness against various attacks that can destroy the non-transferable mechanism established by NTL. Experiments conducted via NTLBench verify the limitations of existing NTL methods in robustness. Finally, we discuss the practical applications of NTL, along with its future directions and associated challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matilde Valente, Tiago C. Dias, Vasco Guerra, Rodrigo Ventura</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which can be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with established physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors mitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in physics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that automatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do not guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and invariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel physics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance with physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined by these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the chosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our method is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a low-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our approach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances predictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when working with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based technique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with existing physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and scalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex physical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16927">BigMac: A Communication-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Model Structure for Fast Training and Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Jin, Shengnan Wang, Jiaan Zhu, Hongrui Zhan, Youhui Bai, Lin Zhang, Zhenyu Ming, Cheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear increase in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE structure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of MoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication introduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained structure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence contributing to heavier communication overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also fine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac is mainly due to that we abandon the \textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{d}escend-\textbf{a}scend-\textbf{c}ommunicate (CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All communication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac designs an efficient \textbf{d}escend-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{a}scend (DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at the entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the communication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to DCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in BigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that BigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs with the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters. Equally importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 3.09$\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\times$ for inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron, Tutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Beck</p>
<p>Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Chateau-Laurent, Rufin VanRullen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afnan Sultan, Max Rausch-Dupont, Shahrukh Khan, Olga Kalinina, Andrea Volkamer, Dietrich Klakow</p>
<p>Abstract: Most of the current transformer-based chemical language models are pre-trained on millions to billions of molecules. However, the improvement from such scaling in dataset size is not confidently linked to improved molecular property prediction. The aim of this study is to investigate and overcome some of the limitations of transformer models in predicting molecular properties. Specifically, we examine the impact of pre-training dataset size and diversity on the performance of transformer models and investigate the use of domain adaptation as a technique for improving model performance. First, our findings indicate that increasing pretraining dataset size beyond 400K molecules from the GuacaMol dataset does not result in a significant improvement on four ADME endpoints, namely, solubility, permeability, microsomal stability, and plasma protein binding. Second, our results demonstrate that using domain adaptation by further training the transformer model on a small set of domain-relevant molecules, i.e., a few hundred to a few thousand, using multi-task regression of physicochemical properties was sufficient to significantly improve performance for three out of the four investigated ADME endpoints (P-value < 0.001). Finally, we observe that a model pre-trained on 400K molecules and domain adopted on a few hundred/thousand molecules performs similarly (P-value > 0.05) to more complicated transformer models like MolBERT(pre-trained on 1.3M molecules) and MolFormer (pre-trained on 100M molecules). A comparison to a random forest model trained on basic physicochemical properties showed similar performance to the examined transformer models. We believe that current transformer models can be improved through further systematic analysis of pre-training and downstream data, pre-training objectives, and scaling laws, ultimately leading to better and more helpful models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Dong, Shaochen Xu, Pengfei He, Yige Li, Jiliang Tang, Tianming Liu, Hui Liu, Zhen Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: MoE (Mixture of Experts) prevails as a neural architecture that can scale modern transformer-based LLMs (Large Language Models) to unprecedented scales. Nevertheless, large MoEs' great demands of computing power, memory capacity and memory bandwidth make scalable serving a fundamental challenge and efficient parallel inference has become a requisite to attain adequate throughput under latency constraints. DeepSpeed-MoE, one state-of-the-art MoE inference framework, adopts a 3D-parallel paradigm including EP (Expert Parallelism), TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallelism). However, our analysis shows DeepSpeed-MoE's inference efficiency is largely bottlenecked by EP, which is implemented with costly all-to-all collectives to route token activation. Our work aims to boost DeepSpeed-MoE by strategically reducing EP's communication overhead with a technique named Speculative MoE. Speculative MoE has two speculative parallelization schemes, speculative token shuffling and speculative expert grouping, which predict outstanding tokens' expert routing paths and pre-schedule tokens and experts across devices to losslessly trim EP's communication volume. Besides DeepSpeed-MoE, we also build Speculative MoE into a prevailing MoE inference engine SGLang. Experiments show Speculative MoE can significantly boost state-of-the-art MoE inference frameworks on fast homogeneous and slow heterogeneous interconnects.</p>

Existing approaches often struggle with efficiency and scalability, requiring extensive memory or model buffers. This work introduces ``No Forgetting Learning" (NFL), a memory-free CL framework that leverages knowledge distillation to maintain stability while preserving plasticity. Memory-free means the NFL does not rely on any memory buffer. Through extensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that NFL achieves competitive performance while utilizing approximately 14.75 times less memory than state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric to better assess CL's plasticity-stability trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Behtash, Marijan Fofonjka, Ethan Baird, Tyler Mauer, Hossein Moghimifam, David Stout, Joel Dennison</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to selective model quantization that transcends the limitations of architecture-specific and size-dependent compression methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) using Entropy-Weighted Quantization (EWQ). By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is a promising paradigm for near-term quantum devices. While existing QRL methods have shown success in discrete action spaces, extending these techniques to continuous domains is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality introduced by discretization. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a quantum Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that efficiently addresses both classical and quantum sequential decision problems in continuous action spaces. Moreover, our approach facilitates single-shot quantum state generation: a one-time optimization produces a model that outputs the control sequence required to drive a fixed initial state to any desired target state. In contrast, conventional quantum control methods demand separate optimization for each target state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and discuss its potential applications in quantum control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Nicola, S. Ivan Trapasso</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the problem of robustness to deformations of the input for deep convolutional neural networks, we identify signal classes which are inherently stable to irregular deformations induced by distortion fields $\tau\in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d;\mathbb{R}^d)$, to be characterized in terms of a generalized modulus of continuity associated with the deformation operator. Resorting to ideas of harmonic and multiscale analysis, we prove that for signals in multiresolution approximation spaces $U_s$ at scale $s$, stability in $L^2$ holds in the regime $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\ll 1$ - essentially as an effect of the uncertainty principle. Instability occurs when $\|\tau\|_{L^\infty}/s\gg 1$, and we provide a sharp upper bound for the asymptotic growth rate. The stability results are then extended to signals in the Besov space $B^{d/2}_{2,1}$ tailored to the given multiresolution approximation. We also consider the case of more general time-frequency deformations. Finally, we provide stochastic versions of the aforementioned results, namely we study the issue of stability in mean when $\tau(x)$ is modeled as a random field (not bounded, in general) with identically distributed variables $|\tau(x)|$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in distributed intelligence have driven impressive progress across a diverse range of applications, from industrial automation to autonomous transportation. Nevertheless, deploying distributed learning services over wireless networks poses numerous challenges. These arise from inherent uncertainties in wireless environments (e.g., random channel fluctuations), limited resources (e.g., bandwidth and transmit power), and the presence of coexisting services on the network. In this paper, we investigate a mixed service scenario wherein high-priority ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and low-priority distributed learning services run concurrently over a network. Utilizing device selection, we aim to minimize the convergence time of distributed learning while simultaneously fulfilling the requirements of the URLLC service. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process and address it via BSAC-CoEx, a framework based on the branching soft actor-critic (BSAC) algorithm that determines each device's participation decision through distinct branches in the actor's neural network. We evaluate our solution with a realistic simulator that is compliant with 3GPP standards for factory automation use cases. Our simulation results confirm that our solution can significantly decrease the training delays of the distributed learning service while keeping the URLLC availability above its required threshold and close to the scenario where URLLC solely consumes all wireless resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting body fat can provide medical practitioners and users with essential information for preventing and diagnosing heart diseases. Hybrid machine learning models offer better performance than simple regression analysis methods by selecting relevant body measurements and capturing complex nonlinear relationships among selected features in modelling body fat prediction problems. There are, however, some disadvantages to them. Current machine learning. Modelling body fat prediction as a combinatorial single- and multi-objective optimisation problem often gets stuck in local optima. When multiple feature subsets produce similar or close predictions, avoiding local optima becomes more complex. Evolutionary feature selection has been used to solve several machine-learning-based optimisation problems. A fuzzy set theory determines appropriate levels of exploration and exploitation while managing parameterisation and computational costs. A weighted-sum body fat prediction approach was explored using evolutionary feature selection, fuzzy set theory, and machine learning algorithms, integrating contradictory metrics into a single composite goal optimised by fuzzy adaptive evolutionary feature selection. Hybrid fuzzy adaptive global learning local search universal diversity-based feature selection is applied to this single-objective feature selection-machine learning framework (FAGLSUD-based FS-ML). While using fewer features, this model achieved a more accurate and stable estimate of body fat percentage than other hybrid and state-of-the-art machine learning models. A multi-objective FAGLSUD-based FS-MLP is also proposed to analyse accuracy, stability, and dimensionality conflicts simultaneously. To make informed decisions about fat deposits in the most vital body parts and blood lipid levels, medical practitioners and users can use a well-distributed Pareto set of trade-off solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Cresci, Kai-Cheng Yang, Angelo Spognardi, Roberto Di Pietro, Filippo Menczer, Marinella Petrocchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on social bots aims at advancing knowledge and providing solutions to one of the most debated forms of online manipulation. Yet, social bot research is plagued by widespread biases, hyped results, and misconceptions that set the stage for ambiguities, unrealistic expectations, and seemingly irreconcilable findings. Overcoming such issues is instrumental towards ensuring reliable solutions and reaffirming the validity of the scientific method. In this contribution, we review some recent results in social bots research, highlighting and revising factual errors as well as methodological and conceptual biases. More importantly, we demystify common misconceptions, addressing fundamental points on how social bots research is discussed. Our analysis surfaces the need to discuss research about online disinformation and manipulation in a rigorous, unbiased, and responsible way. This article bolsters such effort by identifying and refuting common fallacious arguments used by both proponents and opponents of social bots research, as well as providing directions toward sound methodologies for future research in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Paz-Ruza, Amparo Alonso-Betanzos, Berta Guijarro-Berdi\~nas, Brais Cancela, Carlos Eiras-Franco</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender Systems have become crucial in the modern world, commonly guiding users towards relevant content or products, and having a large influence over the decisions of users and citizens. However, ensuring transparency and user trust in these systems remains a challenge; personalized explanations have emerged as a solution, offering justifications for recommendations. Among the existing approaches for generating personalized explanations, using existing visual content created by users is a promising option to maximize transparency and user trust. State-of-the-art models that follow this approach, despite leveraging highly optimized architectures, employ surrogate learning tasks that do not efficiently model the objective of ranking images as explanations for a given recommendation; this leads to a suboptimal training process with high computational costs that may not be reduced without affecting model performance. This work presents BRIE, a novel model where we leverage Bayesian Pairwise Ranking to enhance the training process, allowing us to consistently outperform state-of-the-art models in six real-world datasets while reducing its model size by up to 64 times and its CO2 emissions by up to 75% in training and inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Moin, Atta Badii, Stephan G\"unnemann, Moharram Challenger</p>
<p>Abstract: Various architecture frameworks for software, systems, and enterprises have been proposed in the literature. They identified several stakeholders and defined modeling perspectives, architecture viewpoints, and views to frame and address stakeholder concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML) related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be included in existing architecture frameworks. Only this way can we envision a holistic system architecture description of an ML-enabled system. Note that the ML component behavior and functionalities are special and should be distinguished from traditional software system behavior and functionalities. The main reason is that the actual functionality should be inferred from data instead of being specified at design time. Additionally, the structural models of ML components, such as ML model architectures, are typically specified using different notations and formalisms from what the Software Engineering (SE) community uses for software structural models. Yet, these two aspects, namely ML and non-ML, are becoming so intertwined that it necessitates an extension of software architecture frameworks and modeling practices toward supporting ML-enabled system architectures. In this paper, we address this gap through an empirical study using an online survey instrument. We surveyed 61 subject matter experts from over 25 organizations in 10 countries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carel van Niekerk, Christian Geishauser, Michael Heck, Shutong Feng, Hsien-chin Lin, Nurul Lubis, Benjamin Ruppik, Renato Vukovic, Milica Ga\v{s}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised neural approaches are hindered by their dependence on large, meticulously annotated datasets, a requirement that is particularly cumbersome for sequential tasks. The quality of annotations tends to deteriorate with the transition from expert-based to crowd-sourced labelling. To address these challenges, we present CAMEL (Confidence-based Acquisition Model for Efficient self-supervised active Learning), a pool-based active learning framework tailored to sequential multi-output problems. CAMEL possesses two core features: (1) it requires expert annotators to label only a fraction of a chosen sequence, and (2) it facilitates self-supervision for the remainder of the sequence. By deploying a label correction mechanism, CAMEL can also be utilised for data cleaning. We evaluate CAMEL on two sequential tasks, with a special emphasis on dialogue belief tracking, a task plagued by the constraints of limited and noisy datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that CAMEL significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, the data corrections suggested by our method contribute to an overall improvement in the quality of the resulting datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Dorador</p>
<p>Abstract: Regression forests have long delivered state-of-the-art accuracy, often outperforming regression trees and even neural networks, but they suffer from limited interpretability as ensemble methods. In this work, we revisit forest pruning, an approach that aims to have the best of both worlds: the accuracy of regression forests and the interpretability of regression trees. This pursuit, whose foundation lies at the core of random forest theory, has seen vast success in empirical studies. In this paper, we contribute theoretical results that support and qualify those empirical findings; namely, we prove the asymptotic advantage of a Lasso-pruned forest over its unpruned counterpart under weak assumptions, as well as high-probability finite-sample generalization bounds for regression forests pruned according to the main methods, which we then validate by way of simulation. Then, we test the accuracy of pruned regression forests against their unpruned counterparts on 19 different datasets (16 synthetic, 3 real). We find that in the vast majority of scenarios tested, there is at least one forest-pruning method that yields equal or better accuracy than the original full forest (in expectation), while just using a small fraction of the trees. We show that, in some cases, the reduction in the size of the forest is so dramatic that the resulting sub-forest can be meaningfully merged into a single tree, obtaining a level of interpretability that is qualitatively superior to that of the original regression forest, which remains a black box.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wang, Jiaxuan Zhao, Licheng Jiao, Lingling Li, Fang Liu, Shuyuan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities for generating natural text. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper first illustrates the conceptual parallels between LLMs and EAs at a micro level, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. These parallels highlight potential opportunities for technical advancements in both LLMs and EAs. Subsequently, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research from a macro perspective to uncover critical challenges, with a particular focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. These analyses not only provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind LLMs but also offer potential directions for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangmingmei Yang, Xi Li, Hang Wang, David J. Miller, George Kesidis</p>
<p>Abstract: A variety of defenses have been proposed against Trojans planted in (backdoor attacks on) deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. Backdoor-agnostic methods seek to reliably detect and/or to mitigate backdoors irrespective of the incorporation mechanism used by the attacker, while inversion methods explicitly assume one. In this paper, we describe a new detector that: relies on embedded feature representations to estimate (invert) the backdoor and to identify its target class; can operate without access to the training dataset; and is highly effective for various incorporation mechanisms (i.e., is backdoor agnostic). Our detection approach is evaluated -- and found to be favorable - in comparison with an array of published defenses for a variety of different attacks on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image-classification domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunkai Fu, Brandon G. Nguyen, Jung Hoon Seo, Ryan Zesch, Samson Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the integration of machine learning advice to improve upon traditional data structure designed for efficient search queries. Although there has been recent effort in improving the performance of binary search trees using machine learning advice, e.g., Lin et. al. (ICML 2022), the resulting constructions nevertheless suffer from inherent weaknesses of binary search trees, such as complexity of maintaining balance across multiple updates and the inability to handle partially-ordered or high-dimensional datasets. For these reasons, we focus on skip lists and KD trees in this work. Given access to a possibly erroneous oracle that outputs estimated fractional frequencies for search queries on a set of items, we construct skip lists and KD trees that provably provides the optimal expected search time, within nearly a factor of two. In fact, our learning-augmented skip lists and KD trees are still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant factor. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structures achieves an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list/KD tree construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect. Finally, we empirically show that our learning-augmented search data structures outperforms their corresponding traditional analogs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18668">Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiberiu-Ioan Szatmari, Abhishek Cauligi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent robotic exploration stands to play an important role in space exploration as the next generation of robotic systems ventures to far-flung environments. A key challenge in this new paradigm will be to effectively share and utilize the vast amount of data generated onboard while operating in bandwidth-constrained regimes typical of space missions. Federated learning (FL) is a promising tool for bridging this gap. Drawing inspiration from the upcoming CADRE Lunar rover mission, we propose a federated multi-agent mapping approach that jointly trains a global map model across agents without transmitting raw data. Our method leverages implicit neural mapping to generate parsimonious, adaptable representations, reducing data transmission by up to 93.8% compared to raw maps. Furthermore, we enhance this approach with meta-initialization on Earth-based traversability datasets to significantly accelerate map convergence; reducing iterations required to reach target performance by 80% compared to random initialization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on Martian terrains and glacier datasets, achieving downstream path planning F1 scores as high as 0.95 while outperforming on map reconstruction losses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation and manipulation in open environments require reasoning and replanning with closed-loop feedback. In this work, we present COME-robot, the first closed-loop robotic system utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language foundation model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world scenarios.COME-robot incorporates two key innovative modules: (i) a multi-level open-vocabulary perception and situated reasoning module that enables effective exploration of the 3D environment and target object identification using commonsense knowledge and situated information, and (ii) an iterative closed-loop feedback and restoration mechanism that verifies task feasibility, monitors execution success, and traces failure causes across different modules for robust failure recovery. Through comprehensive experiments involving 8 challenging real-world mobile and tabletop manipulation tasks, COME-robot demonstrates a significant improvement in task success rate (~35%) compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further conduct comprehensive analyses to elucidate how COME-robot's design facilitates failure recovery, free-form instruction following, and long-horizon task planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Lewis, Jean Luca Bez, Surendra Byna</p>
<p>Abstract: Growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has resulted in a surge in demand for faster methods of Machine Learning (ML) model training and inference. This demand for speed has prompted the use of high performance computing (HPC) systems that excel in managing distributed workloads. Because data is the main fuel for AI applications, the performance of the storage and I/O subsystem of HPC systems is critical. In the past, HPC applications accessed large portions of data written by simulations or experiments or ingested data for visualizations or analysis tasks. ML workloads perform small reads spread across a large number of random files. This shift of I/O access patterns poses several challenges to modern parallel storage systems. In this paper, we survey I/O in ML applications on HPC systems, and target literature within a 6-year time window from 2019 to 2024. We define the scope of the survey, provide an overview of the common phases of ML, review available profilers and benchmarks, examine the I/O patterns encountered during offline data preparation, training, and inference, and explore I/O optimizations utilized in modern ML frameworks and proposed in recent literature. Lastly, we seek to expose research gaps that could spawn further R&D.</p>

<p>Abstract: We describe the design and results from the BraTS 2023 Intracranial Meningioma Segmentation Challenge. The BraTS Meningioma Challenge differed from prior BraTS Glioma challenges in that it focused on meningiomas, which are typically benign extra-axial tumors with diverse radiologic and anatomical presentation and a propensity for multiplicity. Nine participating teams each developed deep-learning automated segmentation models using image data from the largest multi-institutional systematically expert annotated multilabel multi-sequence meningioma MRI dataset to date, which included 1000 training set cases, 141 validation set cases, and 283 hidden test set cases. Each case included T2, FLAIR, T1, and T1Gd brain MRI sequences with associated tumor compartment labels delineating enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and surrounding non-enhancing FLAIR hyperintensity. Participant automated segmentation models were evaluated and ranked based on a scoring system evaluating lesion-wise metrics including dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance. The top ranked team had a lesion-wise median dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.976, 0.976, and 0.964 for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor, respectively and a corresponding average DSC of 0.899, 0.904, and 0.871, respectively. These results serve as state-of-the-art benchmarks for future pre-operative meningioma automated segmentation algorithms. Additionally, we found that 1286 of 1424 cases (90.3%) had at least 1 compartment voxel abutting the edge of the skull-stripped image edge, which requires further investigation into optimal pre-processing face anonymization steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyu Chen, Zichen Liu, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Human alignment in large language models (LLMs) is an active area of research. A recent groundbreaking work, direct preference optimization (DPO), has greatly simplified the process from past work in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by bypassing the reward learning stage in RLHF. DPO, after training, provides an implicit reward model. In this work, we make a novel observation that this implicit reward model can by itself be used in a bootstrapping fashion to further align the LLM. Our approach is to use the rewards from a current LLM to construct a preference dataset, which is then used in subsequent DPO rounds. We incorporate two refinements to further improve our approach: 1) length-regularized reward shaping to make the preference dataset length-unbiased; 2) experience replay to enhance the quality of the preference dataset. Our approach, named self-alignment with DPO ImpliCit rEwards (DICE), shows great improvements in alignment. It achieves an increase of more than 8$\\%$ in lengthcontrolled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 for all the different base models that we tried, without relying on external feedback.

<p>Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Meeus, Igor Shilov, Shubham Jain, Manuel Faysse, Marek Rei, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye</p>
<p>Abstract: Whether LLMs memorize their training data and what this means, from measuring privacy leakage to detecting copyright violations, has become a rapidly growing area of research. In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.</p>

Recent works on vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them. Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, we introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% across challenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data. Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failures and correct its behavior using natural language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renato Vukovic, David Arps, Carel van Niekerk, Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Hsien-Chin Lin, Michael Heck, Milica Ga\v{s}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art task-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on task-specific ontologies for fulfilling user queries. The majority of task-oriented dialogue data, such as customer service recordings, comes without ontology and annotation. Such ontologies are normally built manually, limiting the application of specialised systems. Dialogue ontology construction is an approach for automating that process and typically consists of two steps: term extraction and relation extraction. In this work, we focus on relation extraction in a transfer learning set-up. To improve the generalisation, we propose an extension to the decoding mechanism of large language models. We adapt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) decoding, recently developed for reasoning problems, to generative relation extraction. Here, we generate multiple branches in the decoding space and select the relations based on a confidence threshold. By constraining the decoding to ontology terms and relations, we aim to decrease the risk of hallucination. We conduct extensive experimentation on two widely used datasets and find improvements in performance on target ontology for source fine-tuned and one-shot prompted large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuele Rusci, Francesco Paci, Marco Fariselli, Eric Flamand, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a self-learning method to incrementally train (fine-tune) a personalized Keyword Spotting (KWS) model after the deployment on ultra-low power smart audio sensors. We address the fundamental problem of the absence of labeled training data by assigning pseudo-labels to the new recorded audio frames based on a similarity score with respect to few user recordings. By experimenting with multiple KWS models with a number of parameters up to 0.5M on two public datasets, we show an accuracy improvement of up to +19.2% and +16.0% vs. the initial models pretrained on a large set of generic keywords. The labeling task is demonstrated on a sensor system composed of a low-power microphone and an energy-efficient Microcontroller (MCU). By efficiently exploiting the heterogeneous processing engines of the MCU, the always-on labeling task runs in real-time with an average power cost of up to 8.2 mW. On the same platform, we estimate an energy cost for on-device training 10x lower than the labeling energy if sampling a new utterance every 6.1 s or 18.8 s with a DS-CNN-S or a DS-CNN-M model. Our empirical result paves the way to self-adaptive personalized KWS sensors at the extreme edge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sim-to real gap in Reinforcement Learning is when a model trained in a simulator does not translate to the real world. This is a problem for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as vehicle dynamics can vary from simulation to reality, and also from vehicle to vehicle. Slug Mobile is a one tenth scale autonomous vehicle created to help address the sim-to-real gap for AVs by acting as a test-bench to develop models that can easily scale from one vehicle to another. In addition to traditional sensors found in other one tenth scale AVs, we have also included a Dynamic Vision Sensor so we can train Spiking Neural Networks running on neuromorphic hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Wang, Tianxing Chen, Qiaojun Yu, Tianling Xu, Zanxin Chen, Yiting Fu, Ziqi He, Cewu Lu, Yao Mu, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated object manipulation requires precise object interaction, where the object's axis must be carefully considered. Previous research employed interactive perception for manipulating articulated objects, but typically, open-loop approaches often suffer from overlooking the interaction dynamics. To address this limitation, we present a closed-loop pipeline integrating interactive perception with online axis estimation from segmented 3D point clouds. Our method leverages any interactive perception technique as a foundation for interactive perception, inducing slight object movement to generate point cloud frames of the evolving dynamic scene. These point clouds are then segmented using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), after which the moving part of the object is masked for accurate motion online axis estimation, guiding subsequent robotic actions. Our approach significantly enhances the precision and efficiency of manipulation tasks involving articulated objects. Experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches, especially in tasks that demand precise axis-based control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namrata Vaswani, Mohamed Y. Selim, Renee Serrell Gibert</p>
<p>Abstract: Signal Processing (SP) and Machine Learning (ML) rely on good math and coding knowledge, in particular, linear algebra, probability, trigonometry, and complex numbers. A good grasp of these relies on scalar algebra learned in middle school. The ability to understand and use scalar algebra well, in turn, relies on a good foundation in basic arithmetic. Because of various systemic barriers, many students are not able to build a strong foundation in arithmetic in elementary school. This leads them to struggle with algebra and everything after that. Since math learning is cumulative, the gap between those without a strong early foundation and everyone else keeps increasing over the school years and becomes difficult to fill in college. In this article we discuss how SP faculty, students, and professionals can play an important role in starting, and participating in, university-run, or other, out-of-school math support programs to supplement students' learning. Two example programs run by the authors, CyMath at Iowa State and Algebra by 7th Grade (Ab7G) at Purdue, and one run by the Actuarial Foundation, are described. We conclude with providing some simple zero-cost suggestions for public schools that, if adopted, could benefit a much larger number of students than what out-of-school programs can reach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Nguyen, Xing Han, Carl Harris, Suchi Saria, Nhat Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing prominence of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in developing large-scale foundation models, we investigate the Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HMoE), a specialized variant of MoE that excels in handling complex inputs and improving performance on targeted tasks. Our analysis highlights the advantages of using the Laplace gating function over the traditional Softmax gating within the HMoE frameworks. We theoretically demonstrate that applying the Laplace gating function at both levels of the HMoE model helps eliminate undesirable parameter interactions caused by the Softmax gating and, therefore, accelerates the expert convergence as well as enhances the expert specialization. Empirical validation across diverse scenarios supports these theoretical claims. This includes large-scale multimodal tasks, image classification, and latent domain discovery and prediction tasks, where our modified HMoE models show great performance improvements compared to the conventional HMoE models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Ahmadi, Ray Mercurius, Soheil Alizadeh, Kasra Rezaee, Amir Rasouli</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulin Song, Guorui Sang, Jing Yu, Chuangbai Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Singing voice synthesis (SVS) system is expected to generate high-fidelity singing voice from given music scores (lyrics, duration and pitch). Recently, diffusion models have performed well in this field. However, sacrificing inference speed to exchange with high-quality sample generation limits its application scenarios. In order to obtain high quality synthetic singing voice more efficiently, we propose a singing voice synthesis method based on the consistency model, ConSinger, to achieve high-fidelity singing voice synthesis with minimal steps. The model is trained by applying consistency constraint and the generation quality is greatly improved at the expense of a small amount of inference speed. Our experiments show that ConSinger is highly competitive with the baseline model in terms of generation speed and quality. Audio samples are available at https://keylxiao.github.io/consinger.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minkai Xu, Tomas Geffner, Karsten Kreis, Weili Nie, Yilun Xu, Jure Leskovec, Stefano Ermon, Arash Vahdat</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in autoregressive language models, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are still being actively explored. Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3$\times$ sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.

<p>Abstract: Training a policy that can generalize to unknown objects is a long standing challenge within the field of robotics. The performance of a policy often drops significantly in situations where an object in the scene was not seen during training. To solve this problem, we present NeRF-Aug, a novel method that is capable of teaching a policy to interact with objects that are not present in the dataset. This approach differs from existing approaches by leveraging the speed, photorealism, and 3D consistency of a neural radiance field for augmentation. NeRF-Aug both creates more photorealistic data and runs 63% faster than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 5 tasks with 9 novel objects that are not present in the expert demonstrations. We achieve an average performance boost of 55.6% when comparing our method to the next best method. You can see video results at https://nerf-aug.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Giral, Ignacio G\'omez, Ricardo Vinuesa, Soledad Le Clainche</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a transformer-based approach for fault-tolerant control in fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), designed to adapt in real time to dynamic changes caused by structural damage or actuator failures. Unlike traditional Flight Control Systems (FCSs) that rely on classical control theory and struggle under severe alterations in dynamics, our method directly maps outer-loop reference values -- altitude, heading, and airspeed -- into control commands using the in-context learning and attention mechanisms of transformers, thus bypassing inner-loop controllers and fault-detection layers. Employing a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework, the proposed approach trains a student agent with partial observations by transferring knowledge from a privileged expert agent with full observability, enabling robust performance across diverse failure scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based controller outperforms industry-standard FCS and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods, maintaining high tracking accuracy and stability in nominal conditions and extreme failure cases, highlighting its potential for enhancing UAV operational safety and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation remains a major challenge in robotics. Optical tactile sensors like GelSight Mini offer a low-cost solution for contact sensing by capturing soft-body deformations of the silicone gel. However, accurately inferring shear and normal force distributions from these gel deformations has yet to be fully addressed. In this work, we propose a machine learning approach using a U-net architecture to predict force distributions directly from the sensor's raw images. Our model, trained on force distributions inferred from Finite Element Analysis (FEA), demonstrates promising accuracy in predicting normal and shear force distributions for the commercially available GelSight Mini sensor. It also shows potential for generalization across indenters, sensors of the same type, and for enabling real-time application.

<p>Abstract: Interactions with online Large Language Models raise privacy issues where providers can gather sensitive information about users and their companies from the prompts. While Differential Privacy can be applied on textual prompts through the Multidimensional Laplace Mechanism, we show that it is difficult to anticipate the utility of such sanitized prompt. Poor utility has clear monetary consequences for LLM services charging on a pay-per-use model as well as great amount of computing resources wasted. To this end, we propose an architecture to predict the utility of a given sanitized prompt before it is sent to the LLM. We experimentally show that our architecture helps prevent such resource waste for up to 12% of the prompts. We also reproduce experiments from one of the most cited paper on distance-based DP for text sanitization and show that a potential performance-driven implementation choice completely changes the output while not being explicitly defined in the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Fazli Imam, Rufael Fedaku Marew, Jameel Hassan, Mustansar Fiaz, Alham Fikri Aji, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text & visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings & DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual & textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFTer across 11 diverse image classification datasets.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present pseudo-batch inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 6 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexuan Sun, Garvesh Raskutti</p>
<p>Abstract: As opaque black-box predictive models become more prevalent, the need to develop interpretations for these models is of great interest. The concept of variable importance and Shapley values are interpretability measures that applies to any predictive model and assesses how much a variable or set of variables improves prediction performance. When the number of variables is large, estimating variable importance presents a significant computational challenge because re-training neural networks or other black-box algorithms requires significant additional computation. In this paper, we address this challenge for algorithms using gradient descent and gradient boosting (e.g. neural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees). By using the ideas of early stopping of gradient-based methods in combination with warm-start using the dropout method, we develop a scalable method to estimate variable importance for any algorithm that can be expressed as an iterative kernel update equation. Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees by using the theory for early stopping of kernel-based methods for neural networks with sufficiently large (but not necessarily infinite) width and gradient-boosting decision trees that use symmetric trees as a weaker learner. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through simulations and a real data example which illustrates the computational benefit of early stopping rather than fully re-training the model as well as the increased accuracy of our approach.</p>

We propose a safe and efficient Lyapunov-optimization algorithm (SELO) that can achieve an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero cumulative constraint violation. The result also implies SELO achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret when the budget is hard and not allowed to be violated. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as it resembles a primal-dual algorithm where the primal problem is an unconstrained, strongly convex and smooth problem, and the dual problem has a simple gradient-type update.

<p>Abstract: Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection. Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete robot behavior architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Feilong Tang, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to enhance the ability of models trained on source domains to generalize effectively to unseen domains. Recently, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown promise in this area by reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape to obtain more generalized models. However, SAM and its variants sometimes fail to guide the model toward a flat minimum, and their training processes exhibit limitations, hindering further improvements in model generalization. In this paper, we first propose an improved model training process aimed at encouraging the model to converge to a flat minima. To achieve this, we design a curvature metric that has a minimal effect when the model is far from convergence but becomes increasingly influential in indicating the curvature of the minima as the model approaches a local minimum. Then we derive a novel algorithm from this metric, called Meta Curvature-Aware Minimization (MeCAM), to minimize the curvature around the local minima. Specifically, the optimization objective of MeCAM simultaneously minimizes the regular training loss, the surrogate gap of SAM, and the surrogate gap of meta-learning. We provide theoretical analysis on MeCAM's generalization error and convergence rate, and demonstrate its superiority over existing DG methods through extensive experiments on five benchmark DG datasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet. Code will be available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: Study Objectives: We investigate Mamba-based deep learning approaches for sleep staging on signals from ANNE One (Sibel Health, Evanston, IL), a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography (ECG), accelerometry, and temperature, and finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and temperature.
  Methods: We obtained wearable sensor recordings from 360 adults undergoing concurrent polysomnography (PSG) at a tertiary care sleep lab. Each PSG recording was manually scored and these annotations served as ground truth labels for training and evaluation of our models. PSG and wearable sensor data were automatically aligned using their ECG channels with manual confirmation by visual inspection. We trained Mamba-based models with convolutional-recurrent neural network (CRNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures on these recordings. Ensembling of model variants with similar architectures was performed.
  Results: Our best approach, after ensembling, attains a 3-class (wake, non rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep, rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) balanced accuracy of 84.02%, F1 score of 84.23%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 72.89%, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) score of 73.00%; a 4-class (wake, NREM stage 1/2 [N1/N2], NREM stage 3 [N3], REM) balanced accuracy of 75.30%, F1 score of 74.10%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 61.51%, and MCC score of 61.95%; a 5-class (wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 65.11%, F1 score of 66.15%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 53.23%, MCC score of 54.38%.
  Conclusions: Deep learning models can infer major sleep stages from the ANNE One, a wearable system without electroencephalography (EEG), and can be successfully applied to data from adults attending a tertiary care sleep clinic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepehr Dehdashtian, Gautam Sreekumar, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Images generated by text-to-image (T2I) models often exhibit visual biases and stereotypes of concepts such as culture and profession. Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: (M1) Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and (M2) WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: (U1) StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and (U2) SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes. Additionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower Internet footprints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tremendous progress has been made in deep stereo matching to excel on benchmark datasets through per-domain fine-tuning. However, achieving strong zero-shot generalization - a hallmark of foundation models in other computer vision tasks - remains challenging for stereo matching. We introduce FoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation designed to achieve strong zero-shot generalization. To this end, we first construct a large-scale (1M stereo pairs) synthetic training dataset featuring large diversity and high photorealism, followed by an automatic self-curation pipeline to remove ambiguous samples. We then design a number of network architecture components to enhance scalability, including a side-tuning feature backbone that adapts rich monocular priors from vision foundation models to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, and long-range context reasoning for effective cost volume filtering. Together, these components lead to strong robustness and accuracy across domains, establishing a new standard in zero-shot stereo depth estimation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongcheng Zeng, Xinyu Cui, Xuanfa Jin, Guoqing Liu, Zexu Sun, Quan He, Dong Li, Ning Yang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A truly intelligent Large Language Model (LLM) should be capable of correcting errors in its responses through external interactions. However, even the most advanced models often face challenges in improving their outputs. In this paper, we explore how to cultivate LLMs with the self-refinement capability through iterative preference training, and how this ability can be leveraged to improve model performance during inference. To this end, we introduce a novel post-training and inference framework, called ARIES: Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Enhancement Structure. This method iteratively performs preference training and self-refinement-based data collection. During training, ARIES strengthen the model's direct question-answering capability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement potential. During inference, ARIES harnesses this self-refinement capability to generate a series of progressively refined responses, which are then filtered using either the Reward Model Scoring or a simple yet effective Rule-Based Selection mechanism, specifically tailored to our approach, to construct a dataset for the next round of preference training. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of ARIES. When applied to the Llama-3.1-8B model and under the self-refinement setting, ARIES surpasses powerful models such as GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled (LC) and a 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, outperforming Iterative DPO by 27.8% and 35.5% respectively, as well as a 50.3% win rate on Arena-Hard, surpassing Iterative DPO by 26.6%. Furthermore, ARIES consistently enhances performance on mathematical reasoning tasks like GSM8K and MATH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichen Zhang, Mufan Qiu, Zhen Tan, Mohan Zhang, Vincent Lu, Jie Peng, Kaidi Xu, Leandro Z. Agudelo, Peter Qian, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Web browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential in automating complex web-based tasks. Existing approaches typically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and generate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval (for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that remains decoupled from the exploration. In this paper, we propose AgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with task-performance, yielding a "symbiotic improvement" for both large and small LLMs. Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large LLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the distilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often choose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts. This divergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the synthesized data. However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs becomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process. To address this, we propose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis strategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach designed to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. Furthermore, we introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy concerns. Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA performance with both LLM types. Our best Large LLM agent reaches 52%, surpassing the previous best of 45%, while our 8B distilled model demonstrates a competitive 49%, exceeding the prior best of 28%. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joongkyu Lee, Min-hwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee & Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee & Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and introducing a novel intermediary term to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm, OFU-MN$^2$L, which achieves an anytime poly(B)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Feng, Viraj Parimi, Brian Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous environments. Traditional planning methods excel at long-horizon tasks but rely on a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based plan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing faster and safer routes over extended distances.
  Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level goal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for their safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling efficient coordination among agents.
  Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple agents in complex and hazardous environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cornelius Emde, Alasdair Paren, Preetham Arvind, Maxime Kayser, Tom Rainforth, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Bernard Ghanem, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to perform constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess, and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach, which we call VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates, which bound the probability of out-of-domain samples tightly with minimum penalty to refusal behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile Anand, Jan van den Brand, Rose McCarty</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of preprocessing an $n\times n$ matrix M, and supporting queries that, for any vector v, returns the matrix-vector product Mv. This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on one side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in practice, whereas theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved faster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even in the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot explain this gap between theory and practice. Therefore, we study the problem for structured matrices. We show that for $n\times n$ matrices of VC-dimension d, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing and $\tilde O(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant VC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an explanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice. Moreover, our bounds hold even if the matrix does not have a low VC-dimension, but is obtained by (possibly adversarially) corrupting at most a subquadratic number of entries of any unknown low VC-dimension matrix. Our results yield the first non-trivial upper bounds for many applications. In previous works, the online matrix-vector hypothesis (conjecturing that quadratic time is needed per query) was used to prove many conditional lower bounds, showing that it is impossible to compute and maintain high-accuracy estimates for shortest paths, Laplacian solvers, effective resistance, and triangle detection in graphs subject to node insertions and deletions in subquadratic time. Yet, via a reduction to our matrix-vector-multiplication result, we show we can maintain the aforementioned problems efficiently if the input is structured, providing the first subquadratic upper bounds in the high-accuracy regime.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel class of regularization functions, called Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) regularizers, which can be designed to induce a wide range of properties in solution vectors of optimization problems. To demonstrate the versatility of CS regularizers, we derive regularization functions that promote discrete-valued vectors, eigenvectors of a given matrix, and orthogonal matrices. The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal, compact yet highly capable language and multimodal models. Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Shuhaib Mehri, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality (M3HF), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, M3HF leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weight by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that M3HF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Kazeev, Wei Nong, Ignat Romanov, Ruiming Zhu, Andrey Ustyuzhanin, Shuya Yamazaki, Kedar Hippalgaonkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentai Wu, Ligang He, Saiqin Long, Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem, Yingliang Wu, Rui Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Data, as an observable form of knowledge, has become one of the most important factors of production for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, increasing legislation and regulations on private and proprietary information results in scattered data sources also known as the "data islands". Although some collaborative learning paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL) can enable privacy-preserving training over decentralized data, they have inherent deficiencies in fairness, costs and reproducibility because of being learning-centric, which greatly limits the way how participants cooperate with each other. In light of this, we present a knowledge-centric paradigm termed Knowledge Augmentation in Federation (KAF), with focus on how to enhance local knowledge through collaborative effort. We provide the suggested system architecture, formulate the prototypical optimization objective, and review emerging studies that employ methodologies suitable for KAF. On our roadmap, with a three-way categorization we describe the methods for knowledge expansion, knowledge filtering, and label and feature space correction in the federation. Further, we highlight several challenges and open questions that deserve more attention from the community. With our investigation, we intend to offer new insights for what collaborative learning can bring back to decentralized data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjun Kim, Kanghoon Lee, Junho Park, Jiachen Li, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04280">Towards Autonomous Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Robotic Manipulation with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Niccol\`o Turcato, Matteo Iovino, Aris Synodinos, Alberto Dalla Libera, Ruggero Carli, Pietro Falco</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex HumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.</p>
