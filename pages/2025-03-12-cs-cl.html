<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07806">Towards Large Language Models that Benefit for All: Benchmarking Group Fairness in Reward Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kefan Song, Jin Yao, Runnan Jiang, Rohan Chandra, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful and accessible to human users, ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups, i.e., group fairness, is a critical ethical concern. However, current fairness and bias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional group fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the non-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same across different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups, however, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes impractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final output without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in LLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For finetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned reward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the LLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias. Recognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of learned reward models. By using expert-written text from arXiv, we are able to benchmark the group fairness of reward models without requiring the same prompt questions across different demographic groups. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that all the evaluated reward models (e.g., Nemotron-4-340B-Reward, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1, and GRM-llama3-8B-sftreg) exhibit statistically significant group unfairness. We also observed that top-performing reward models (w.r.t. canonical performance metrics) tend to demonstrate better group fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenglu Hong, Ravi Raju, Jonathan Lingjie Li, Bo Li, Urmish Thakker, Avinash Ravichandran, Swayambhoo Jain, Changran Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective method for accelerating inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a small draft model to predict the output of a target model. However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Yin, Zifeng Wang, I-Hung Hsu, Jun Yan, Ke Jiang, Yanfei Chen, Jindong Gu, Long T. Le, Kai-Wei Chang, Chen-Yu Lee, Hamid Palangi, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to effectively utilize external tools to address user queries. However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Sch\"offel, Marinus Wiedner, Esteban Garces Arias, Paula Ruppert, Christian Heumann, Matthias A{\ss}enmacher</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their effectiveness in handling historical languages remains largely unexplored. This study examines the performance of open-source LLMs in part-of-speech (POS) tagging for Old Occitan, a historical language characterized by non-standardized orthography and significant diachronic variation. Through comparative analysis of two distinct corpora-hagiographical and medical texts-we evaluate how current models handle the inherent challenges of processing a low-resource historical language. Our findings demonstrate critical limitations in LLM performance when confronted with extreme orthographic and syntactic variability. We provide detailed error analysis and specific recommendations for improving model performance in historical language processing. This research advances our understanding of LLM capabilities in challenging linguistic contexts while offering practical insights for both computational linguistics and historical language studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samir Abdaljalil, Hasan Kurban, Erchin Serpedin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various contexts, yet remain prone to generating non-factual content, commonly referred to as "hallucinations". The literature categorizes hallucinations into several types, including entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. However, existing hallucination datasets often fail to capture fine-grained hallucinations in multilingual settings. In this work, we introduce HalluVerse25, a multilingual LLM hallucination dataset that categorizes fine-grained hallucinations in English, Arabic, and Turkish. Our dataset construction pipeline uses an LLM to inject hallucinations into factual biographical sentences, followed by a rigorous human annotation process to ensure data quality. We evaluate several LLMs on HalluVerse25, providing valuable insights into how proprietary models perform in detecting LLM-generated hallucinations across different contexts.</p>

We took a `bag-of-sounds' approach by training our hate speech detection system on the speech (audio) data using transformed Mel spectrogram measures. While our candidate model performed poorly on the test set, our approach offered promising results during training and development for Malayalam and Tamil.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li (Ehsan), Malcolm Grossman (Ehsan),  Eric (Ehsan),  Qasemi, Mihir Kulkarni, Muhao Chen, Yao-Yi Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Geospatial question answering (QA) is a fundamental task in navigation and point of interest (POI) searches. While existing geospatial QA datasets exist, they are limited in both scale and diversity, often relying solely on textual descriptions of geo-entities without considering their geometries. A major challenge in scaling geospatial QA datasets for reasoning lies in the complexity of geospatial relationships, which require integrating spatial structures, topological dependencies, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities that most text-based QA datasets lack. To address these limitations, we introduce MapQA, a novel dataset that not only provides question-answer pairs but also includes the geometries of geo-entities referenced in the questions. MapQA is constructed using SQL query templates to extract question-answer pairs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for two study regions: Southern California and Illinois. It consists of 3,154 QA pairs spanning nine question types that require geospatial reasoning, such as neighborhood inference and geo-entity type identification. Compared to existing datasets, MapQA expands both the number and diversity of geospatial question types. We explore two approaches to tackle this challenge: (1) a retrieval-based language model that ranks candidate geo-entities by embedding similarity, and (2) a large language model (LLM) that generates SQL queries from natural language questions and geo-entity attributes, which are then executed against an OSM database. Our findings indicate that retrieval-based methods effectively capture concepts like closeness and direction but struggle with questions that require explicit computations (e.g., distance calculations). LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini) excel at generating SQL queries for one-hop reasoning but face challenges with multi-hop reasoning, highlighting a key bottleneck in advancing geospatial QA systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Fang, Hadi Pouransari, Matt Jordan, Alexander Toshev, Vaishaal Shankar, Ludwig Schmidt, Tom Gunter</p>
<p>Abstract: Data filtering has become a powerful tool for improving model performance while reducing computational cost. However, as large language model compute budgets continue to grow, the limited data volume provided by heavily filtered and deduplicated datasets will become a practical constraint. In efforts to better understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute budgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data filtering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to the training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up to ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a single epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this finding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate repeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all documents within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets relative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual documents. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale, data filtering remains an important direction of research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce Gemini Embedding, a state-of-the-art embedding model leveraging the power of Gemini, Google's most capable large language model. Capitalizing on Gemini's inherent multilingual and code understanding capabilities, Gemini Embedding produces highly generalizable embeddings for text spanning numerous languages and textual modalities. The representations generated by Gemini Embedding can be precomputed and applied to a variety of downstream tasks including classification, similarity, clustering, ranking, and retrieval. Evaluated on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), which includes over one hundred tasks across 250+ languages, Gemini Embedding substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, demonstrating considerable improvements in embedding quality. Achieving state-of-the-art performance across MMTEB's multilingual, English, and code benchmarks, our unified model demonstrates strong capabilities across a broad selection of tasks and surpasses specialized domain-specific models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07903">Can Memory-Augmented Language Models Generalize on Reasoning-in-a-Haystack Tasks?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Payel Das, Ching-Yun Ko, Sihui Dai, Georgios Kollias, Subhajit Chaudhury, Aurelie Lozano</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models often expose their brittleness in reasoning tasks, especially while executing long chains of reasoning over context. We propose MemReasoner, a new and simple memory-augmented LLM architecture, in which the memory learns the relative order of facts in context, and enables hopping over them, while the decoder selectively attends to the memory. MemReasoner is trained end-to-end, with optional supporting fact supervision of varying degrees. We train MemReasoner, along with existing memory-augmented transformer models and a state-space model, on two distinct synthetic multi-hop reasoning tasks. Experiments performed under a variety of challenging scenarios, including the presence of long distractor text or target answer changes in test set, show strong generalization of MemReasoner on both single- and two-hop tasks. This generalization of MemReasoner is achieved using none-to-weak supporting fact supervision (using none and 1\% of supporting facts for one- and two-hop tasks, respectively). In contrast, baseline models overall struggle to generalize and benefit far less from using full supporting fact supervision. The results highlight the importance of explicit memory mechanisms, combined with additional weak supervision, for improving large language model's context processing ability toward reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun-Hao Cao, Yangsong Wang, Shuzheng Hao, Zhenxing Li, Chengjun Zhan, Sichao Liu, Yi-Qi Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), enabling diverse, complex tasks. However, extensive token counts lead to high computational and financial burdens. To address this, we propose Efficient and Flexible Prompt Compression (EFPC), a novel method unifying task-aware and task-agnostic compression for a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EFPC uses GPT-4 to generate compressed prompts and integrates them with original prompts for training. During training and inference, we selectively prepend user instructions and compress prompts based on predicted probabilities. EFPC is highly data-efficient, achieving significant performance with minimal data. Compared to the state-of-the-art method LLMLingua-2, EFPC achieves a 4.8% relative improvement in F1-score with 1% additional data at a 4x compression rate, and an 11.4% gain with 10% additional data on the LongBench single-doc QA benchmark. EFPC's unified framework supports broad applicability and enhances performance across various models, tasks, and domains, offering a practical advancement in NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Yan, Junyuan Liu, Bo-Wen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivation: Despite recent advancements in semantic representation driven by pre-trained and large-scale language models, addressing long tail challenges in multi-label text classification remains a significant issue. Long tail challenges have persistently posed difficulties in accurately classifying less frequent labels. Current approaches often focus on improving text semantics while neglecting the crucial role of label relationships. Results: This paper introduces LabelCoRank, a novel approach inspired by ranking principles. LabelCoRank leverages label co-occurrence relationships to refine initial label classifications through a dual-stage reranking process. The first stage uses initial classification results to form a preliminary ranking. In the second stage, a label co-occurrence matrix is utilized to rerank the preliminary results, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the final classifications. By integrating the reranked label representations as additional text features, LabelCoRank effectively mitigates long tail issues in multi-labeltext classification. Experimental evaluations on popular datasets including MAG-CS, PubMed, and AAPD demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LabelCoRank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Xie, Nitya Babbar, Vicky Chen, Yoanna Turura</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-switching, or alternating between languages within a single conversation, presents challenges for multilingual language models on NLP tasks. This research investigates if pre-training Multilingual BERT (mBERT) on code-switched datasets improves the model's performance on critical NLP tasks such as part of speech tagging, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language identification. We use a dataset of Spanglish tweets for pre-training and evaluate the pre-trained model against a baseline model.
  Our findings show that our pre-trained mBERT model outperforms or matches the baseline model in the given tasks, with the most significant improvements seen for parts of speech tagging. Additionally, our latent analysis uncovers more homogenous English and Spanish embeddings for language identification tasks, providing insights for future modeling work.
  This research highlights potential for adapting multilingual LMs for code-switched input data in order for advanced utility in globalized and multilingual contexts. Future work includes extending experiments to other language pairs, incorporating multiform data, and exploring methods for better understanding context-dependent code-switches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in open-ended dialogue, yet their inability to retain and retrieve relevant information from long-term interactions limits their effectiveness in applications requiring sustained personalization. External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities-utterances, turns, and sessions-into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Gao, Ankita Sinha, Kamalika Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive few-shot learning capabilities, but their performance varies widely based on the sequence of in-context examples. Key factors influencing this include the sequence's length, composition, and arrangement, as well as its relation to the specific query. Existing methods often tackle these factors in isolation, overlooking their interdependencies. Moreover, the extensive search space for selecting optimal sequences complicates the development of a holistic approach. In this work, we introduce Beam Search-based Example Sequence Constructor (BESC), a novel method for learning to construct optimal example sequences. BESC addresses all key factors involved in sequence selection by considering them jointly during inference, while incrementally building the sequence. This design enables the use of beam search to significantly reduce the complexity of the search space. Experiments across various datasets and language models show notable improvements in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishani Mondal, Jack W. Stokes, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Longqi Yang, Mengting Wan, Xiaofeng Xu, Xia Song, Jennifer Neville</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs often fail to meet the specialized needs of distinct user groups due to their one-size-fits-all training paradigm \cite{lucy-etal-2024-one} and there is limited research on what personalization aspects each group expect. To address these limitations, we propose a group-aware personalization framework, Group Preference Alignment (GPA), that identifies context-specific variations in conversational preferences across user groups and then steers LLMs to address those preferences. Our approach consists of two steps: (1) Group-Aware Preference Extraction, where maximally divergent user-group preferences are extracted from real-world conversation logs and distilled into interpretable rubrics, and (2) Tailored Response Generation, which leverages these rubrics through two methods: a) Context-Tuned Inference (GAP-CT), that dynamically adjusts responses via context-dependent prompt instructions, and b) Rubric-Finetuning Inference (GPA-FT), which uses the rubrics to generate contrastive synthetic data for personalization of group-specific models via alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves alignment of the output with respect to user preferences and outperforms baseline methods, while maintaining robust performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naomi Baes, Rapha\"el Merx, Nick Haslam, Ekaterina Vylomova, Haim Dubossarsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) offers insights into cultural and social dynamics. Yet, the validity of methods for measuring kinds of LSC has yet to be established due to the absence of historical benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we develop a novel three-stage evaluation framework that involves: 1) creating a scalable, domain-general methodology for generating synthetic datasets that simulate theory-driven LSC across time, leveraging In-Context Learning and a lexical database; 2) using these datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of various methods; and 3) assessing their suitability for specific dimensions and domains. We apply this framework to simulate changes across key dimensions of LSC (SIB: Sentiment, Intensity, and Breadth) using examples from psychology, and evaluate the sensitivity of selected methods to detect these artificially induced changes. Our findings support the utility of the synthetic data approach, validate the efficacy of tailored methods for detecting synthetic changes in SIB, and reveal that a state-of-the-art LSC model faces challenges in detecting affective dimensions of LSC. This framework provides a valuable tool for dimension- and domain-specific bench-marking and evaluation of LSC methods, with particular benefits for the social sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Luo, Feifan Song, Wei Li, Guangyue Peng, Shaohang Wei, Houfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly required to generate text that is both factually accurate and diverse across various open-ended applications. However, current stochastic decoding methods struggle to balance such objectives. We introduce Dynamic Focus Decoding (DFD), a novel plug-and-play stochastic approach that resolves this trade-off without requiring additional data, knowledge, or models. DFD adaptively adjusts the decoding focus based on distributional differences across layers, leveraging the modular and hierarchical nature of factual knowledge within LLMs. This dynamic adjustment improves factuality in knowledge-intensive decoding steps and promotes diversity in less knowledge-reliant steps. DFD can be easily integrated with existing decoding methods, enhancing both factuality and diversity with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate that DFD significantly improves performance, providing a scalable and efficient solution for open-ended text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Veisi, Amir Mansourian</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers' ability to generalize to longer sequences than they have been trained on, known as length extrapolation, degrades as sequence length increases. Most of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) methods address this problem by either adding constant linear biases or learning general biases, lacking the ability to specialize for different sequences. In this work, inspired by ALiBi, we propose Context-aware Biases for Length Extrapolation (Cable), that learns token-specific biases for each head in decoder-based transformers. Cable learns adaptive, context-aware biases, overcoming the limitations of fixed patterns by adding dynamic biases specific to each token in the sequence. Results show that when tested on a sequence length of 1024, a GPT-3 Medium (334M parameters) with our positional encoding, trained on a sequence length of 512, achieves better perplexity (-0.65) than a similar network with sinusoidal positional encoding trained on a sequence length of 1024. This is achieved with 48% lower memory usage, and only 3.5% higher training time. Furthermore, our method notably improves the extrapolation ability of existing RPE methods on the Edu-FineWeb10B and WikiText-103 datasets. Code is available at: https://github.com/axiomlab/Cable</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haji Gul, Abdul Ghani Naim, Ajaz Ahmad Bhat</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug target interactions is critical for accelerating drug discovery and elucidating complex biological mechanisms. In this work, we frame drug target prediction as a link prediction task on heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graphs (KG) that integrate drugs, proteins, diseases, pathways, and other relevant entities. Conventional KG embedding methods such as TransE and ComplEx SE are hindered by their reliance on computationally intensive negative sampling and their limited generalization to unseen drug target pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Multi Context Aware Sampling (MuCoS), a novel framework that prioritizes high-density neighbours to capture salient structural patterns and integrates these with contextual embeddings derived from BERT. By unifying structural and textual modalities and selectively sampling highly informative patterns, MuCoS circumvents the need for negative sampling, significantly reducing computational overhead while enhancing predictive accuracy for novel drug target associations and drug targets. Extensive experiments on the KEGG50k dataset demonstrate that MuCoS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 13\% improvement in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in predicting any relation in the dataset and a 6\% improvement in dedicated drug target relation prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work proposes an LSTM-based sentiment classification model with multi-head attention mechanism and TF-IDF optimization. Through the integration of TF-IDF feature extraction and multi-head attention, the model significantly improves text sentiment analysis performance. Experimental results on public data sets demonstrate that the new method achieves substantial improvements in the most critical metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score compared to baseline models. Specifically, the model achieves an accuracy of 80.28% on the test set, which is improved by about 12% in comparison with standard LSTM models. Ablation experiments also support the necessity and necessity of all modules, in which the impact of multi-head attention is greatest to performance improvement. This research provides a proper approach to sentiment analysis, which can be utilized in public opinion monitoring, product recommendation, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Mihaela Trusca, Liesbeth Allein</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretations of a single sentence can vary, particularly when its context is lost. This paper aims to simulate how readers perceive content with varying toxicity levels by generating diverse interpretations of out-of-context sentences. By modeling toxicity, we can anticipate misunderstandings and reveal hidden toxic meanings. Our proposed decoding strategy explicitly controls toxicity in the set of generated interpretations by (i) aligning interpretation toxicity with the input, (ii) relaxing toxicity constraints for more toxic input sentences, and (iii) promoting diversity in toxicity levels within the set of generated interpretations. Experimental results show that our method improves alignment with human-written interpretations in both syntax and semantics while reducing model prediction uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuchen Gao, Zizheng Zhan, Xianming Li, Erxin Yu, Haotian Zhang, Yuqun Zhang, Jing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key element of modern artificial intelligence, demonstrating the ability to address a wide range of language processing tasks at unprecedented levels of accuracy without the need of collecting problem-specific data. However, these versatile models face a significant challenge: both their training and inference processes require substantial computational resources, time, and memory. Consequently, optimizing this kind of models to minimize these requirements is crucial. In this article, we demonstrate that, with minimal resources and in a remarkably short time, it is possible to enhance a state-of-the-art model, specifically for a given language task, without compromising its overall capabilities using a relatively small pretrained LLM as a basis. Specifically, we present our use case, RigoChat 2, illustrating how LLMs can be adapted to achieve superior results in Spanish-language tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Violence descriptions in literature offer valuable insights for a wide range of research in the humanities. For historians, depictions of violence are of special interest for analyzing the societal dynamics surrounding large wars and individual conflicts of influential people. Harvesting data for violence research manually is laborious and time-consuming. This study is the first one to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in identifying violence in ancient texts and categorizing it across multiple dimensions. Our experiments identify LLMs as a valuable tool to scale up the accurate analysis of historical texts and show the effect of fine-tuning and data augmentation, yielding an F1-score of up to 0.93 for violence detection and 0.86 for fine-grained violence categorization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Meng, Fan Zhang, Wendao Yao, Zhenyuan Guo, Yuwei Li, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in a wide range of applications; however, their deployment is plagued by security vulnerabilities, notably jailbreak attacks. These attacks manipulate LLMs to generate harmful or unethical content by crafting adversarial prompts. While much of the current research on jailbreak attacks has focused on single-turn interactions, it has largely overlooked the impact of historical dialogues on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak paradigm, Dialogue Injection Attack (DIA), which leverages the dialogue history to enhance the success rates of such attacks. DIA operates in a black-box setting, requiring only access to the chat API or knowledge of the LLM's chat template. We propose two methods for constructing adversarial historical dialogues: one adapts gray-box prefilling attacks, and the other exploits deferred responses. Our experiments show that DIA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent LLMs, including Llama-3.1 and GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate that DIA can bypass 5 different defense mechanisms, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nandakishor M</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, I present our work on DeepRAG, a specialized embedding model we built specifically for Hindi language in RAG systems. While LLMs have gotten really good at generating text, their performance in retrieval tasks still depends heavily on having quality embeddings - something that's been lacking for Hindi despite being one of the world's most spoken languages. We tackled this by creating embeddings from the ground up rather than just fine-tuning existing models. Our process involved collecting diverse Hindi texts (over 2.7M samples), training a custom SentencePiece tokenizer that actually understands Hindi morphology, designing transformer architecture with Hindi-specific attention mechanisms, and optimizing with contrastive learning. Results were honestly better than I expected - we saw a 23% improvement in retrieval precision compared to the multilingual models everyone's been using. The paper details our methodology, which I think could help others working with low-resource languages where the one-size-fits-all multilingual models fall short. We've also integrated our embeddings with LangChain to build complete Hindi RAG systems, which might be useful for practitioners. While there's still tons more to explore, I believe this work addresses a critical gap for Hindi NLP and demonstrates why language-specific approaches matter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esther Chiramal, Kelvin Soh Boon Kai</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI is a strong strategy implemented to understand complex black-box model predictions in a human interpretable language. It provides the evidence required to execute the use of trustworthy and reliable AI systems. On the other hand, however, it also opens the door to locating possible vulnerabilities in an AI model. Traditional adversarial text attack uses word substitution, data augmentation techniques and gradient-based attacks on powerful pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) variants to generate adversarial sentences. These attacks are generally whitebox in nature and not practical as they can be easily detected by humans E.g. Changing the word from "Poor" to "Rich". We proposed a simple yet effective Grey-box cum Black-box approach that does not require the knowledge of the model while using a set of surrogate Transformer/BERT models to perform the attack using Explainable AI techniques. As Transformers are the current state-of-the-art models for almost all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, an attack generated from BERT1 is transferable to BERT2. This transferability is made possible due to the attention mechanism in the transformer that allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in a sequence. Using the power of BERT generalisation via attention, we attempt to exploit how transformers learn by attacking a few surrogate transformer variants which are all based on a different architecture. We demonstrate that this approach is highly effective to generate semantically good sentences by changing as little as one word that is not detectable by humans while still fooling other BERT models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Morteza Rohanian, Tarun Mehra, Nicola Miglino, Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Michael Krauthammer, Andreas Wicki</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical oncology generates vast, unstructured data that often contain inconsistencies, missing information, and ambiguities, making it difficult to extract reliable insights for data-driven decision-making. General-purpose large language models (LLMs) struggle with these challenges due to their lack of domain-specific reasoning, including specialized clinical terminology, context-dependent interpretations, and multi-modal data integration. We address these issues with an oncology-specialized, efficient, and adaptable NLP framework that combines instruction tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and graph-based knowledge integration. Our lightweight models prove effective at oncology-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition (e.g., identifying cancer diagnoses), entity linking (e.g., linking entities to standardized ontologies), TNM staging, document classification (e.g., cancer subtype classification from pathology reports), and treatment response prediction. Our framework emphasizes adaptability and resource efficiency. We include minimal German instructions, collected at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ), to test whether small amounts of non-English language data can effectively transfer knowledge across languages. This approach mirrors our motivation for lightweight models, which balance strong performance with reduced computational costs, making them suitable for resource-limited healthcare settings. We validated our models on oncology datasets, demonstrating strong results in named entity recognition, relation extraction, and document classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Pombal, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Ricardo Rei, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: As automatic metrics become increasingly stronger and widely adopted, the risk of unintentionally "gaming the metric" during model development rises. This issue is caused by metric interference (Mint), i.e., the use of the same or related metrics for both model tuning and evaluation. Mint can misguide practitioners into being overoptimistic about the performance of their systems: as system outputs become a function of the interfering metric, their estimated quality loses correlation with human judgments. In this work, we analyze two common cases of Mint in machine translation-related tasks: filtering of training data, and decoding with quality signals. Importantly, we find that Mint strongly distorts instance-level metric scores, even when metrics are not directly optimized for -- questioning the common strategy of leveraging a different, yet related metric for evaluation that is not used for tuning. To address this problem, we propose MintAdjust, a method for more reliable evaluation under Mint. On the WMT24 MT shared task test set, MintAdjust ranks translations and systems more accurately than state-of-the-art-metrics across a majority of language pairs, especially for high-quality systems. Furthermore, MintAdjust outperforms AutoRank, the ensembling method used by the organizers.</p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenRAG, a RAG framework that is optimized end-to-end by tuning the retriever to capture in-context relevance, enabling adaptation to the diverse and evolving needs.

Additionally, our results indicate that for some tasks, an end-to-end tuned 0.2B retriever can achieve improvements that surpass those of RAG-oriented or instruction-tuned 8B large language models (LLMs), highlighting the cost-effectiveness of our approach in enhancing RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Kuznetsova, Ilaria Vitulano, Mykola Makhortykh, Martha Stolze, Tomas Nagy, Victoria Vziatysheva</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of this study is to assess how large language models (LLMs) can be used for fact-checking and contribute to the broader debate on the use of automated means for veracity identification. To achieve this purpose, we use AI auditing methodology that systematically evaluates performance of five LLMs (ChatGPT 4, Llama 3 (70B), Llama 3.1 (405B), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini) using prompts regarding a large set of statements fact-checked by professional journalists (16,513). Specifically, we use topic modeling and regression analysis to investigate which factors (e.g. topic of the prompt or the LLM type) affect evaluations of true, false, and mixed statements. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT 4 and Google Gemini achieved higher accuracy than other models, overall performance across models remains modest. Notably, the results indicate that models are better at identifying false statements, especially on sensitive topics such as COVID-19, American political controversies, and social issues, suggesting possible guardrails that may enhance accuracy on these topics. The major implication of our findings is that there are significant challenges for using LLMs for factchecking, including significant variation in performance across different LLMs and unequal quality of outputs for specific topics which can be attributed to deficits of training data. Our research highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in political fact-checking, suggesting potential avenues for further improvements in guardrails as well as fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Different from other text generation tasks, in product description generation, it is of vital importance to generate faithful descriptions that stick to the product attribute information. However, little attention has been paid to this problem. To bridge this gap, we propose a model named Fidelity-oriented Product Description Generator (FPDG). FPDG takes the entity label of each word into account, since the product attribute information is always conveyed by entity words. Specifically, we first propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) decoder based on the Entity-label-guided Long Short-Term Memory (ELSTM) cell, taking both the embedding and the entity label of each word as input. Second, we establish a keyword memory that stores the entity labels as keys and keywords as values, allowing FPDG to attend to keywords by attending to their entity labels. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real-world product description dataset show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both traditional generation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, FPDG increases the fidelity of the generated descriptions by 25%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Cao, Lingwei Wei, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of social platforms exacerbates the dissemination of misinformation, which stimulates the research in fact verification. Recent studies tend to leverage semantic features to solve this problem as a single-hop task. However, the process of verifying a claim requires several pieces of evidence with complicated inner logic and relations to verify the given claim in real-world situations. Recent studies attempt to improve both understanding and reasoning abilities to enhance the performance, but they overlook the crucial relations between entities that benefit models to understand better and facilitate the prediction. To emphasize the significance of relations, we resort to Large Language Models (LLMs) considering their excellent understanding ability. Instead of other methods using LLMs as the predictor, we take them as relation extractors, for they do better in understanding rather than reasoning according to the experimental results. Thus, to solve the challenges above, we propose a novel Structured Knowledge-Augmented LLM-based Network (LLM-SKAN) for multi-hop fact verification. Specifically, we utilize an LLM-driven Knowledge Extractor to capture fine-grained information, including entities and their complicated relations. Besides, we leverage a Knowledge-Augmented Relation Graph Fusion module to interact with each node and learn better claim-evidence representations comprehensively. The experimental results on four common-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqi Fan, Xuezhi Fang, Xingrun Xing, Peng Han, Shuo Shang, Yequan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the large number of parameters, the inference phase of Large Language Models (LLMs) is resource-intensive. Unlike traditional model compression, which needs retraining, recent dynamic computation methods show that not all components are required for inference, enabling a training-free pipeline. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic depth of LLM generation. A token-position aware layer skipping framework is proposed to save 1.5x times operations efficiently while maintaining performance. We first observed that tokens predicted later have lower perplexity and thus require less computation. Then, we propose a training-free algorithm called Position-Aware Depth Decay Decoding ($D^3$), which leverages a power-law decay function, $\left\lfloor L \times (\alpha^i) \right\rfloor$, to determine the number of layers to retain when generating token $T_i$. Remarkably, without any retraining, the $D^3$ achieves success across a wide range of generation tasks for the first time. Experiments on large language models (\ie the Llama) with $7 \sim 70$ billion parameters show that $D^3$ can achieve an average 1.5x speedup compared with the full-inference pipeline while maintaining comparable performance with nearly no performance drop ($<1\%$) on the GSM8K and BBH benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancements in audio foundation models (FMs) have fueled interest in end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems, but different web interfaces for each system makes it challenging to compare and contrast them effectively. Motivated by this, we introduce an open-source, user-friendly toolkit designed to build unified web interfaces for various cascaded and E2E spoken dialogue systems. Our demo further provides users with the option to get on-the-fly automated evaluation metrics such as (1) latency, (2) ability to understand user input, (3) coherence, diversity, and relevance of system response, and (4) intelligibility and audio quality of system output. Using the evaluation metrics, we compare various cascaded and E2E spoken dialogue systems with a human-human conversation dataset as a proxy. Our analysis demonstrates that the toolkit allows researchers to effortlessly compare and contrast different technologies, providing valuable insights such as current E2E systems having poorer audio quality and less diverse responses. An example demo produced using our toolkit is publicly available here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Siddhant/Voice_Assistant_Demo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sher Badshah, Hassan Sajjad</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) free-form generated responses remains a challenge due to their diverse and open-ended nature. Traditional supervised signal-based automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or handle the variability of open-ended responses, while human evaluation, though reliable, is resource-intensive. Leveraging LLMs as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. Taking advantage of these capabilities, we propose the Dynamic Arbitration Framework for Evaluation (DAFE), which employs two primary LLM-as-judges and engages a third arbitrator only in cases of disagreements. This selective arbitration prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands compared to conventional majority voting. DAFE utilizes task-specific reference answers with dynamic arbitration to enhance judgment accuracy, resulting in significant improvements in evaluation metrics such as Macro F1 and Cohen's Kappa. Through experiments, including a comprehensive human evaluation, we demonstrate DAFE's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating free-form model outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in scientific research assessment, particularly in automated paper review. However, existing LLM-based review systems face significant challenges, including limited domain expertise, hallucinated reasoning, and a lack of structured evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepReview, a multi-stage framework designed to emulate expert reviewers by incorporating structured analysis, literature retrieval, and evidence-based argumentation. Using DeepReview-13K, a curated dataset with structured annotations, we train DeepReviewer-14B, which outperforms CycleReviewer-70B with fewer tokens. In its best mode, DeepReviewer-14B achieves win rates of 88.21\% and 80.20\% against GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations. Our work sets a new benchmark for LLM-based paper review, with all resources publicly available. The code, model, dataset and demo have be released in http://ai-researcher.net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xu, Wei Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Julian McAuley</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have established that language models manifest stereotyped biases. Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Delip Rao, Weiqiu You, Eric Wong, Chris Callison-Burch</p>
<p>Abstract: We present NSF-SciFy, a large-scale dataset for scientific claim extraction derived from the National Science Foundation (NSF) awards database, comprising over 400K grant abstracts spanning five decades. While previous datasets relied on published literature, we leverage grant abstracts which offer a unique advantage: they capture claims at an earlier stage in the research lifecycle before publication takes effect. We also introduce a new task to distinguish between existing scientific claims and aspirational research intentions in proposals.Using zero-shot prompting with frontier large language models, we jointly extract 114K scientific claims and 145K investigation proposals from 16K grant abstracts in the materials science domain to create a focused subset called NSF-SciFy-MatSci. We use this dataset to evaluate 3 three key tasks: (1) technical to non-technical abstract generation, where models achieve high BERTScore (0.85+ F1); (2) scientific claim extraction, where fine-tuned models outperform base models by 100% relative improvement; and (3) investigation proposal extraction, showing 90%+ improvement with fine-tuning. We introduce novel LLM-based evaluation metrics for robust assessment of claim/proposal extraction quality. As the largest scientific claim dataset to date -- with an estimated 2.8 million claims across all STEM disciplines funded by the NSF -- NSF-SciFy enables new opportunities for claim verification and meta-scientific research. We publicly release all datasets, trained models, and evaluation code to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Xiao, Chin-Jou Li, Yilin Zhang, Graham Neubig, Amanda Bertsch</p>
<p>Abstract: Many-shot in-context learning has recently shown promise as an alternative to finetuning, with the major advantage that the same model can be served for multiple tasks. However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, a training-free framework for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method's accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parishad BehnamGhader, Nicholas Meade, Siva Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-following retrievers have been widely adopted alongside LLMs in real-world applications, but little work has investigated the safety risks surrounding their increasing search capabilities. We empirically study the ability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and when used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we investigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find that given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for >50% of queries) select relevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for 61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with instruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can be surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we show that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious requests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context. In summary, our findings underscore the malicious misuse risks associated with increasing retriever capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierpaolo Basile, Lucia Siciliani, Elio Musacchio, Giovanni Semeraro</p>
<p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a historical task in computational linguistics that has received much attention over the years. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), interest in this task (in its classical definition) has decreased. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs on the WSD task. We extend a previous benchmark (XL-WSD) to re-design two subtasks suitable for LLM: 1) given a word in a sentence, the LLM must generate the correct definition; 2) given a word in a sentence and a set of predefined meanings, the LLM must select the correct one. The extended benchmark is built using the XL-WSD and BabelNet. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in zero-shot learning but cannot surpass current state-of-the-art methods. However, a fine-tuned model with a medium number of parameters outperforms all other models, including the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li, Shinda Huang, Jiangtian Wang, Nathan Zhang, Antonis Antoniades, Wenyue Hua, Kaijie Zhu, Sirui Zeng, William Yang Wang, Xifeng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: As language agents progressively automate critical tasks across domains, their ability to operate within operational constraints and safety protocols becomes essential. While extensive research has demonstrated these agents' effectiveness in downstream task completion, their reliability in following operational procedures and constraints remains largely unexplored. To this end, we present AgentOrca, a dual-system framework for evaluating language agents' compliance with operational constraints and routines. Our framework encodes action constraints and routines through both natural language prompts for agents and corresponding executable code serving as ground truth for automated verification. Through an automated pipeline of test case generation and evaluation across five real-world domains, we quantitatively assess current language agents' adherence to operational constraints. Our findings reveal notable performance gaps among state-of-the-art models, with large reasoning models like o1 demonstrating superior compliance while others show significantly lower performance, particularly when encountering complex constraints or user persuasion attempts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they remain prone to errors. A key challenge is enabling them to self-correct. While prior research has relied on external tools or large proprietary models, this work explores self-correction in small language models (SLMs) through iterative fine-tuning using solely self-generated data. We introduce the Self-Taught Self-Correction (STaSC) algorithm, which incorporates multiple algorithmic design choices. Experimental results on a question-answering task demonstrate that STaSC effectively learns self-correction, leading to significant performance improvements. Our analysis further provides insights into the mechanisms of self-correction and the impact of different design choices on learning dynamics and overall performance. To support future research, we release our user-friendly codebase and lightweight models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wang, Sunhao Dai, Haiyuan Zhao, Liang Pang, Xiao Zhang, Gang Wang, Zhenhua Dong, Jun Xu, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies have found that PLM-based retrieval models exhibit a preference for LLM-generated content, assigning higher relevance scores to these documents even when their semantic quality is comparable to human-written ones. This phenomenon, known as source bias, threatens the sustainable development of the information access ecosystem. However, the underlying causes of source bias remain unexplored. In this paper, we explain the process of information retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based retrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source bias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher. Theoretical analysis further reveals that the phenomenon stems from the positive correlation between the gradients of the loss functions in language modeling task and retrieval task. Based on the analysis, a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method is proposed, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC). CDC first diagnoses the bias effect of the perplexity and then separates the bias effect from the overall estimated relevance score. Experimental results across three domains demonstrate the superior debiasing effectiveness of CDC, emphasizing the validity of our proposed explanatory framework.

<p>Abstract: Implementing new features in repository-level codebases is a crucial application of code generation models. However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of science and the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, Large Language Models (LLMs) have begun to be widely utilized across various fields. However, in the field of psychological counseling, the ability of LLMs have not been systematically assessed. In this study, we assessed the psychological counseling ability of mainstream LLMs using 1096 psychological counseling skill questions which were selected from the Chinese National Counselor Level 3 Examination, including Knowledge-based, Analytical-based, and Application-based question types. The analysis showed that the correctness rates of the LLMs for Chinese questions, in descending order, were GLM-3 (46.5%), GPT-4 (46.1%), Gemini (45.0%), ERNIE-3.5 (45.7%) and GPT-3.5 (32.9%). The correctness rates of the LLMs for English questions, in descending order, were ERNIE-3.5 (43.9%), GPT-4 (40.6%), Gemini (36.6%), GLM-3 (29.9%) and GPT-3.5 (29.5%). A chi-square test indicated significant differences in the LLMs' performance on Chinese and English questions. Furthermore, we subsequently utilized the Counselor's Guidebook (Level 3) as a reference for ERNIE-3.5, resulting in a new correctness rate of 59.6%, a 13.8% improvement over its initial rate of 45.8%. In conclusion, the study assessed the psychological counseling ability of LLMs for the first time, which may provide insights for future enhancement and improvement of psychological counseling ability of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present FourierNAT, a novel non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) architecture that employs Fourier-based mixing in the decoder to generate output sequences in parallel. While traditional NAT approaches often face challenges with capturing global dependencies, our method leverages a discrete Fourier transform to mix token embeddings across the entire sequence dimension, coupled with learned frequency-domain gating. This allows the model to efficiently propagate context without explicit autoregressive steps. Empirically, FourierNAT achieves competitive results against leading NAT baselines on standard benchmarks like WMT machine translation and CNN/DailyMail summarization, providing significant speed advantages over autoregressive Transformers. We further demonstrate that learned frequency-domain parameters allow the model to adaptively focus on long-range or short-range dependencies, partially mitigating the well-known coherence gaps in one-pass NAT generation. Overall, FourierNAT highlights the potential of integrating spectral-domain operations to accelerate and improve parallel text generation. This approach can potentially provide great computational and time savings in inference tasks LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixing Chen, Yang Liu, Binglin Chen, Jiandong Su, Yongsen Zheng, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Video question grounding (VideoQG) requires models to answer the questions and simultaneously infer the relevant video segments to support the answers. However, existing VideoQG methods usually suffer from spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to a failure to identify the dominant visual scenes that align with the intended question. Moreover, vision-language models exhibit unfaithful generalization performance and lack robustness on challenging downstream tasks such as VideoQG. In this work, we propose a novel VideoQG framework named Cross-modal Causal Relation Alignment (CRA), to eliminate spurious correlations and improve the causal consistency between question-answering and video temporal grounding. Our CRA involves three essential components: i) Gaussian Smoothing Grounding (GSG) module for estimating the time interval via cross-modal attention, which is de-noised by an adaptive Gaussian filter, ii) Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA) enhances the performance of weakly supervised VideoQG by leveraging bidirectional contrastive learning between estimated video segments and QA features, iii) Explicit Causal Intervention (ECI) module for multimodal deconfounding, which involves front-door intervention for vision and back-door intervention for language. Extensive experiments on two VideoQG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CRA in discovering visually grounded content and achieving robust question reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyi Yang, Constantin Venhoff, Ashkan Khakzar, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Puneet K. Dokania, Adel Bibi, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurons in large language models often exhibit \emph{polysemanticity}, simultaneously encoding multiple unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present \textbf{MoE-X}, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be \emph{intrinsically} interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the observation that, in language models, wider networks with sparse activations are more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training such large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures offer a scalable alternative by activating only a subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only the most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance comparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability. MoE-X achieves a perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qasim Bin Saeed, Ijaz Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, calls for immediate need in developing tools for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, like Reddit, represent a rich source of user-generated content, reflecting emotional and behavioral patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework that integrates linguistic and temporal features for early detection of mental health crises. Our approach is based on the method that utilizes a BiLSTM network both for text and temporal feature analysis, modeling sequential dependencies in a different manner, capturing contextual patterns quite well. This work includes a cross-modal attention approach that allows fusion of such outputs into context-aware classification of mental health conditions. The model was then trained and evaluated on a dataset of labeled Reddit posts preprocessed using text preprocessing, scaling of temporal features, and encoding of labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture performs better compared to traditional models with a validation accuracy of 74.55% and F1-Score of 0.7376. This study presents the importance of multi-modal learning for mental health detection and provides a baseline for further improvements by using more advanced attention mechanisms and other data modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Group fairness is a central research topic in text classification, where reaching fair treatment between sensitive groups (e.g., women and men) remains an open challenge. We propose an approach that extends the use of the Wasserstein Dependency Measure for learning unbiased neural text classifiers. Given the challenge of distinguishing fair from unfair information in a text encoder, we draw inspiration from adversarial training by inducing independence between representations learned for the target label and those for a sensitive attribute. We further show that Domain Adaptation can be efficiently leveraged to remove the need for access to the sensitive attributes in the dataset we cure. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that our approach is well-founded.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhruv Gautam, Spandan Garg, Jinu Jang, Neel Sundaresan, Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranjal Atrey, Michael P. Brundage, Min Wu, Sanghamitra Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretable machine learning models offer understandable reasoning behind their decision-making process, though they may not always match the performance of their black-box counterparts. This trade-off between interpretability and model performance has sparked discussions around the deployment of AI, particularly in critical applications where knowing the rationale of decision-making is essential for trust and accountability. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of several black-box and interpretable models, focusing on a specific NLP use case that has received limited attention: inferring ratings from reviews. Through this use case, we explore the intricate relationship between the performance and interpretability of different models. We introduce a quantitative score called Composite Interpretability (CI) to help visualize the trade-off between interpretability and performance, particularly in the case of composite models. Our results indicate that, in general, the learning performance improves as interpretability decreases, but this relationship is not strictly monotonic, and there are instances where interpretable models are more advantageous.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiao Song, Katherine Thai, Chau Minh Pham, Yapei Chang, Mazin Nadaf, Mohit Iyyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing search inefficiencies and domain knowledge gaps as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 24.3% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region of extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, yet it remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research. This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that fail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally relevant data for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL aims to ensure better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages in VL research. Beyond crowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the automatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image generation. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision models, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA cultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and cultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA culturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. Through SEA-VL, we aim to bridge the representation gap in SEA, fostering the development of more inclusive AI systems that authentically represent diverse cultures across SEA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taoxu Zhao, Meisi Li, Kehao Chen, Liye Wang, Xucheng Zhou, Kunal Chaturvedi, Mukesh Prasad, Ali Anaissi, Ali Braytee</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis enhances conventional sentiment analysis, which traditionally relies solely on text, by incorporating information from different modalities such as images, text, and audio. This paper proposes a novel multimodal sentiment analysis architecture that integrates text and image data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiments. For text feature extraction, we utilize BERT, a natural language processing model. For image feature extraction, we employ DINOv2, a vision-transformer-based model. The textual and visual latent features are integrated using proposed fusion techniques, namely the Basic Fusion Model, Self Attention Fusion Model, and Dual Attention Fusion Model. Experiments on three datasets, Memotion 7k dataset, MVSA single dataset, and MVSA multi dataset, demonstrate the viability and practicality of the proposed multimodal architecture.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-SQL systems have improved the conversion of natural language queries into SQL, but challenges remain in ensuring accuracy and reliability. While self-correction techniques refine outputs, they often introduce new errors. Existing methods focused on execution feedback mainly address syntax issues, leaving semantic errors -- where the query's logic fails to align with the user's intent -- largely unaddressed.
  We propose a novel approach combining structured execution feedback with a trained critic agent that provides detailed, interpretable critiques. This method effectively identifies and corrects both syntactic and semantic errors, enhancing accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show significant improvements on two major Text-to-SQL benchmarks, Spider and BIRD, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Fu Lim, Jiawen Zhu, Guansong Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Log Anomaly Detection (LAD) seeks to identify atypical patterns in log data that are crucial to assessing the security and condition of systems. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in various fields, the use of LLMs in enabling the detection of log anomalies is largely unexplored. This work aims to fill this gap. Due to the prohibitive costs involved in fully fine-tuning LLMs, we explore the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) for adapting LLMs to LAD. To have an in-depth exploration of the potential of LLM-driven LAD, we present a comprehensive investigation of leveraging two of the most popular PEFTs -- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) -- to tap into three prominent LLMs of varying size, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, and Llama-3, for parameter-efficient LAD. Comprehensive experiments on four public log datasets are performed to reveal important insights into effective LLM-driven LAD in several key perspectives, including the efficacy of these PEFT-based LLM-driven LAD methods, their stability, sample efficiency, robustness w.r.t. unstable logs, and cross-dataset generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Wei, Xiang Ying, Tao Gao, Felix Tao, Jingbo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human interaction with the external world fundamentally involves the exchange of personal memory, whether with other individuals, websites, applications, or, in the future, AI agents. A significant portion of this interaction is redundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across different contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials, autofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate this redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly used user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like SECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME further represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction with persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems. We have open-sourced the fully localizable deployment system at GitHub: https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring safe, comfortable, and efficient planning is crucial for autonomous driving systems. While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well in standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) advancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational inefficiency. Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow", we propose $\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that synergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module. The fast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory generation in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through uncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario resolution. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic switching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time uncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan feedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A bidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's reasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making. To strengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled with reward-instruct training strategy. In open-loop experiments, FASIONAD achieves a $6.7\%$ reduction in average $L2$ trajectory error and $28.1\%$ lower collision rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Di Menna, Luca Traini, Gabriele Bavota, Vittorio Cortellessa</p>
<p>Abstract: Code optimization is the process of enhancing code efficiency, while preserving its intended functionality. This process often requires a deep understanding of the code execution behavior at run-time to identify and address inefficiencies effectively. Recent studies have shown that language models can play a significant role in automating code optimization. However, these models may have insufficient knowledge of how code execute at run-time. To address this limitation, researchers have developed strategies that integrate code execution information into language models. These strategies have shown promise, enhancing the effectiveness of language models in various software engineering tasks. However, despite the close relationship between code execution behavior and efficiency, the specific impact of these strategies on code optimization remains largely unexplored. This study investigates how incorporating code execution information into language models affects their ability to optimize code. Specifically, we apply three different training strategies to incorporate four code execution aspects -- line executions, line coverage, branch coverage, and variable states -- into CodeT5+, a well-known language model for code. Our results indicate that execution-aware models provide limited benefits compared to the standard CodeT5+ model in optimizing code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruibin Xiong, Yimeng Chen, Dmitrii Khizbullin, J\"urgen Schmidhuber</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types, i.e. retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces JurisTCU, a Brazilian Portuguese dataset for legal information retrieval (LIR). The dataset is freely available and consists of 16,045 jurisprudential documents from the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts, along with 150 queries annotated with relevance judgments. It addresses the scarcity of Portuguese-language LIR datasets with query relevance annotations. The queries are organized into three groups: real user keyword-based queries, synthetic keyword-based queries, and synthetic question-based queries. Relevance judgments were produced through a hybrid approach combining LLM-based scoring with expert domain validation. We used JurisTCU in 14 experiments using lexical search (document expansion methods) and semantic search (BERT-based and OpenAI embeddings). We show that the document expansion methods significantly improve the performance of standard BM25 search on this dataset, with improvements exceeding 45% in P@10, R@10, and nDCG@10 metrics when evaluating short keyword-based queries. Among the embedding models, the OpenAI models produced the best results, with improvements of approximately 70% in P@10, R@10, and nDCG@10 metrics for short keyword-based queries, suggesting that these dense embeddings capture semantic relationships in this domain, surpassing the reliance on lexical terms. Besides offering a dataset for the Portuguese-language IR research community, suitable for evaluating search systems, the results also contribute to enhancing a search system highly relevant to Brazilian citizens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Gao, Zongyun Zhang, Mingye Xie, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reading relevant scientific papers and analyzing research development trends is a critical step in generating new scientific ideas. However, the rapid increase in the volume of research literature and the complex citation relationships make it difficult for researchers to quickly analyze and derive meaningful research trends. The development of large language models (LLMs) has provided a novel approach for automatically summarizing papers and generating innovative research ideas. However, existing paper-based idea generation methods either simply input papers into LLMs via prompts or form logical chains of creative development based on citation relationships, without fully exploiting the semantic information embedded in these citations. Inspired by knowledge graphs and human cognitive processes, we propose a framework called the Graph of AI Ideas (GoAI) for the AI research field, which is dominated by open-access papers. This framework organizes relevant literature into entities within a knowledge graph and summarizes the semantic information contained in citations into relations within the graph. This organization effectively reflects the relationships between two academic papers and the advancement of the AI research field. Such organization aids LLMs in capturing the current progress of research, thereby enhancing their creativity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating novel, clear, and effective research ideas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Arcuschin, Jett Janiak, Robert Krzyzanowski, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal concerning rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (30.6%), DeepSeek R1 (15.8%) and ChatGPT-4o (12.6%) all answer a high proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has achieved impressive success in generation tasks to militate the "exposure bias" problem and discriminatively exploit the different quality of references. Existing works mostly focus on contrastive learning on the instance-level without discriminating the contribution of each word, while keywords are the gist of the text and dominant the constrained mapping relationships. Hence, in this work, we propose a hierarchical contrastive learning mechanism, which can unify hybrid granularities semantic meaning in the input text. Concretely, we first propose a keyword graph via contrastive correlations of positive-negative pairs to iteratively polish the keyword representations. Then, we construct intra-contrasts within instance-level and keyword-level, where we assume words are sampled nodes from a sentence distribution. Finally, to bridge the gap between independent contrast levels and tackle the common contrast vanishing problem, we propose an inter-contrast mechanism that measures the discrepancy between contrastive keyword nodes respectively to the instance distribution. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines on paraphrasing, dialogue generation, and storytelling tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation tasks proliferates, concerns arise over their potential to compromise academic integrity. The education sector currently tussles with distinguishing student-authored homework assignments from AI-generated ones. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing HowkGPT, designed to identify homework assignments generated by AI. HowkGPT is built upon a dataset of academic assignments and accompanying metadata [17] and employs a pretrained LLM to compute perplexity scores for student-authored and ChatGPT-generated responses. These scores then assist in establishing a threshold for discerning the origin of a submitted assignment. Given the specificity and contextual nature of academic work, HowkGPT further refines its analysis by defining category-specific thresholds derived from the metadata, enhancing the precision of the detection. This study emphasizes the critical need for effective strategies to uphold academic integrity amidst the growing influence of LLMs and provides an approach to ensuring fair and accurate grading in educational institutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region rich in linguistic diversity and cultural variety, with over 1,300 indigenous languages and a population of 671 million people. However, prevailing AI models suffer from a significant lack of representation of texts, images, and audio datasets from SEA, compromising the quality of AI models for SEA languages. Evaluating models for SEA languages is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, compounded by the dominance of English training data, raising concerns about potential cultural misrepresentation. To address these challenges, we introduce SEACrowd, a collaborative initiative that consolidates a comprehensive resource hub that fills the resource gap by providing standardized corpora in nearly 1,000 SEA languages across three modalities. Through our SEACrowd benchmarks, we assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA. Furthermore, we propose strategies to facilitate greater AI advancements, maximizing potential utility and resource equity for the future of AI in SEA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Liu, Jiajun Zhu, Xukai Liu, Haoyu Tang, Yanghai Zhang, Kai Zhang, Xiaofang Zhou, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Fake News Detection (FS-FND) aims to distinguish inaccurate news from real ones in extremely low-resource scenarios. This task has garnered increased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact of fake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge and excellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and Information Scarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Knowledge-guided Fake News Detection (DKFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outside perspectives. Specifically, DKFND first identifies the knowledge concepts of each news article through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DKFND creatively designs an Investigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable information concerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to evaluate the relevance and confidence of them. Finally, a Determination Module further derives two respective predictions and obtain the final result. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Futeral, Cordelia Schmid, Beno\^it Sagot, Rachel Bawden</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal machine translation (MMT) systems rely on fully supervised data (i.e models are trained on sentences with their translations and accompanying images). However, this type of data is costly to collect, limiting the extension of MMT to other language pairs for which such data does not exist. In this work, we propose a method to bypass the need for fully supervised data to train MMT systems, using multimodal English data only. Our method, called ZeroMMT, consists in adapting a strong text-only machine translation (MT) model by training it on a mixture of two objectives: visually conditioned masked language modelling and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the original and new MMT outputs. We evaluate on standard MMT benchmarks and the recently released CoMMuTE, a contrastive benchmark aiming to evaluate how well models use images to disambiguate English sentences. We obtain disambiguation performance close to state-of-the-art MMT models trained additionally on fully supervised examples. To prove that our method generalizes to languages with no fully supervised training data available, we extend the CoMMuTE evaluation dataset to three new languages: Arabic, Russian and Chinese. We further show that we can control the trade-off between disambiguation capabilities and translation fidelity at inference time using classifier-free guidance and without any additional data. Our code, data and trained models are publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Kuzmin, Neemesh Yadav, Ivan Smirnov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism designed to enhance the overall model quality in terms of prediction performance and fairness, especially in scenarios where retraining the model is impractical. The method draws inspiration from selective classification, where at inference time, predictions with low quality, as indicated by their uncertainty scores, are discarded. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we remove bias from these predictions using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard uncertainty quantification methods. Experiments on text classification datasets with encoder-based classification models demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to reduce the performance gap between post-processing methods and debiasing techniques from the at-training and pre-processing categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingning Guo, Mengwei Wu, Yuxiang Shen, Haifeng Li, Chao Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end interpretation currently dominates the remote sensing fine-grained ship classification (RS-FGSC) task. However, the inference process remains uninterpretable, leading to criticisms of these models as "black box" systems. To address this issue, we propose a domain knowledge-enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt generation mechanism, which is used to semi-automatically construct a task-specific instruction-following dataset, TITANIC-FGS. By training on TITANIC-FGS, we adapt general-domain vision-language models (VLMs) to the FGSC task, resulting in a model named IFShip. Building upon IFShip, we develop an FGSC visual chatbot that redefines the FGSC problem as a step-by-step reasoning task and conveys the reasoning process in natural language. Experimental results show that IFShip outperforms state-of-the-art FGSC algorithms in both interpretability and classification accuracy. Furthermore, compared to VLMs such as LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, IFShip demonstrates superior performance on the FGSC task. It provides an accurate chain of reasoning when fine-grained ship types are recognizable to the human eye and offers interpretable explanations when they are not.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Fu, Jie He, Yifan Yang, Qun Liu, Deyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Meta learning has been widely used to exploit rich-resource source tasks to improve the performance of low-resource target tasks. Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdur Rasool, Muhammad Irfan Shahzad, Hafsa Aslam, Vincent Chan, Muhammad Ali Arshad</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathetic and coherent responses are critical in auto-mated chatbot-facilitated psychotherapy. This study addresses the challenge of enhancing the emotional and contextual understanding of large language models (LLMs) in psychiatric applications. We introduce Emotion-Aware Embedding Fusion, a novel framework integrating hierarchical fusion and attention mechanisms to prioritize semantic and emotional features in therapy transcripts. Our approach combines multiple emotion lexicons, including NRC Emotion Lexicon, VADER, WordNet, and SentiWordNet, with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Flan-T5, LLAMA 2, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT 4. Therapy session transcripts, comprising over 2,000 samples are segmented into hierarchical levels (word, sentence, and session) using neural networks, while hierarchical fusion combines these features with pooling techniques to refine emotional representations. Atten-tion mechanisms, including multi-head self-attention and cross-attention, further prioritize emotional and contextual features, enabling temporal modeling of emotion-al shifts across sessions. The processed embeddings, computed using BERT, GPT-3, and RoBERTa are stored in the Facebook AI similarity search vector database, which enables efficient similarity search and clustering across dense vector spaces. Upon user queries, relevant segments are retrieved and provided as context to LLMs, enhancing their ability to generate empathetic and con-textually relevant responses. The proposed framework is evaluated across multiple practical use cases to demonstrate real-world applicability, including AI-driven therapy chatbots. The system can be integrated into existing mental health platforms to generate personalized responses based on retrieved therapy session data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Grangier, Simin Fan, Skyler Seto, Pierre Ablin</p>
<p>Abstract: Specialist language models (LMs) focus on a specific task or domain on which they often outperform generalist LMs of the same size. However, the specialist data needed to pretrain these models is only available in limited amount for most tasks. In this work, we build specialist models from large generalist training sets instead. We propose a novel method, ClusteRed Importance SamPling (CRISP). CRISP clusters the generalist dataset and samples from these clusters based on their frequencies in the smaller specialist dataset. It is scalable, suitable for both pretraining and continued pretraining, and works well in multi-task settings. CRISP performs favorably compared to other methods that adjust the training distribution of the generalist data with guidance from the limited domain-specific data. Our findings demonstrate improvements across different domains in terms of language modeling perplexity and accuracy on multiple-choice question tasks. We also present ablation studies that examine the impact of dataset sizes, clustering configurations, and model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanouil Zaranis, Giuseppe Attanasio, Sweta Agrawal, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) -- the automatic assessment of translation quality -- has recently become crucial across several stages of the translation pipeline, from data curation to training and decoding. While QE metrics have been optimized to align with human judgments, whether they encode social biases has been largely overlooked. Biased QE risks favoring certain demographic groups over others, e.g., by exacerbating gaps in visibility and usability. This paper defines and investigates gender bias of QE metrics and discusses its downstream implications for machine translation (MT). Experiments with state-of-the-art QE metrics across multiple domains, datasets, and languages reveal significant bias. When a human entity's gender in the source is undisclosed, masculine-inflected translations score higher than feminine-inflected ones and gender-neutral translations are penalized. Even when contextual cues disambiguate gender, using context-aware QE metrics leads to more errors in picking the correct translation inflection for feminine than masculine referents. Moreover, a biased QE metric affects data filtering and quality-aware decoding. Our findings highlight the need for renewed focus in developing and evaluating QE metrics centered around gender.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Hamna, Deepthi Sudharsan, Agrima Seth, Ritvik Budhiraja, Deepika Khullar, Vyshak Jain, Kalika Bali, Aditya Vashistha, Sameer Segal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-To-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated the ability to generate compelling text and visual stories. However, their outputs are predominantly aligned with the sensibilities of the Global North, often resulting in an outsider's gaze on other cultures. As a result, non-Western communities have to put extra effort into generating culturally specific stories. To address this challenge, we developed a visual storytelling tool called Kahani that generates culturally grounded visual stories for non-Western cultures. Our tool leverages off-the-shelf models GPT-4 Turbo and Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL). By using Chain of Thought (CoT) and T2I prompting techniques, we capture the cultural context from user's prompt and generate vivid descriptions of the characters and scene compositions. To evaluate the effectiveness of Kahani, we conducted a comparative user study with ChatGPT-4 (with DALL-E3) in which participants from different regions of India compared the cultural relevance of stories generated by the two tools. The results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis performed in the user study show that Kahani's visual stories are more culturally nuanced than those generated by ChatGPT-4. In 27 out of 36 comparisons, Kahani outperformed or was on par with ChatGPT-4, effectively capturing cultural nuances and incorporating more Culturally Specific Items (CSI), validating its ability to generate culturally grounded visual stories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaofeng Wu, Xinyan Velocity Yu, Dani Yogatama, Jiasen Lu, Yoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern language models can process inputs across diverse languages and modalities. We hypothesize that models acquire this capability through learning a shared representation space across heterogeneous data types (e.g., different languages and modalities), which places semantically similar inputs near one another, even if they are from different modalities/languages. We term this the semantic hub hypothesis, following the hub-and-spoke model from neuroscience (Patterson et al., 2007) which posits that semantic knowledge in the human brain is organized through a transmodal semantic "hub" which integrates information from various modality-specific "spokes" regions. We first show that model representations for semantically equivalent inputs in different languages are similar in the intermediate layers, and that this space can be interpreted using the model's dominant pretraining language via the logit lens. This tendency extends to other data types, including arithmetic expressions, code, and visual/audio inputs. Interventions in the shared representation space in one data type also predictably affect model outputs in other data types, suggesting that this shared representations space is not simply a vestigial byproduct of large-scale training on broad data, but something that is actively utilized by the model during input processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization of user-generated content remains a critical challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods often fail to ensure equitable representation across different social groups, leading to biased outputs. In this paper, we introduce two novel methods for fair extractive summarization: FairExtract, a clustering-based approach, and FairGPT, which leverages GPT-3.5-turbo with fairness constraints. We evaluate these methods using Divsumm summarization dataset of White-aligned, Hispanic, and African-American dialect tweets and compare them against relevant baselines. The results obtained using a comprehensive set of summarization quality metrics such as SUPERT, BLANC, SummaQA, BARTScore, and UniEval, as well as a fairness metric F, demonstrate that FairExtract and FairGPT achieve superior fairness while maintaining competitive summarization quality. Additionally, we introduce composite metrics (e.g., SUPERT+F, BLANC+F) that integrate quality and fairness into a single evaluation framework, offering a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between these objectives. Our code is available online.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: DNN-based language models perform excellently on various tasks, but even SOTA LLMs are susceptible to textual adversarial attacks. Adversarial texts play crucial roles in multiple subfields of NLP. However, current research has the following issues. (1) Most textual adversarial attack methods target rich-resourced languages. How do we generate adversarial texts for less-studied languages? (2) Most textual adversarial attack methods are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial texts. How do we construct high-quality adversarial robustness benchmarks? (3) New language models may be immune to part of previously generated adversarial texts. How do we update adversarial robustness benchmarks? To address the above issues, we introduce HITL-GAT, a system based on a general approach to human-in-the-loop generation of adversarial texts. HITL-GAT contains four stages in one pipeline: victim model construction, adversarial example generation, high-quality benchmark construction, and adversarial robustness evaluation. Additionally, we utilize HITL-GAT to make a case study on Tibetan script which can be a reference for the adversarial research of other less-studied languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown great potential to transform online medical consultation. Despite this, most research targets improving diagnostic accuracy with ample information, often overlooking the inquiry phase. Some studies try to evaluate or refine doctor models by using prompt-engineered patient agents. However, prompt engineering alone falls short in accurately simulating real patients. We need to explore new paradigms for patient simulation. Furthermore, the relationship between inquiry and diagnosis remains unexplored. This paper extracts dialogue strategies from real doctor-patient conversations to guide the training of a patient simulator. Our simulator shows higher anthropomorphism and lower hallucination rates, using dynamic dialogue strategies. This innovation offers a more accurate evaluation of diagnostic models and generates realistic synthetic data. We conduct extensive experiments on the relationship between inquiry and diagnosis, showing they adhere to Liebig's law: poor inquiry limits diagnosis effectiveness, regardless of diagnostic skill, and vice versa. The experiments also reveal substantial differences in inquiry performance among models. To delve into this phenomenon, the inquiry process is categorized into four distinct types. Analyzing the distribution of inquiries across these types helps explain the performance differences.

<p>Abstract: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to enhance text-to-SQL model fine-tuning. These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing more explainable reasoning structures than DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayem Mohammad Imtiaz, Astha Singh, Fraol Batole, Hridesh Rajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Not a day goes by without hearing about the impressive feats of large language models (LLMs), and equally, not a day passes without hearing about their challenges. LLMs are notoriously vulnerable to biases in their dataset, leading to issues such as toxicity. While domain-adaptive training has been employed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model parameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair quality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach selectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair. Specifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers that require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas. This method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the model's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We evaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families, with parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our results show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing 46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline, direct preference optimization. Our empirical analysis also reveals that errors are more concentrated in a smaller section of the model, with the top 20% of layers exhibiting 773% more error density than the remaining 80\%. This highlights the need for selective repair. Additionally, we demonstrate that a dynamic selection approach is essential for addressing errors dispersed throughout the model, ensuring a robust and efficient repair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghao Ying, Deyue Zhang, Zonglei Jing, Yisong Xiao, Quanchen Zou, Aishan Liu, Siyuan Liang, Xiangzheng Zhang, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks simulate real-world human interactions by engaging large language models (LLMs) in iterative dialogues, exposing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilin Zhao, Tengyu Pan, Xu Han, Yudi Zhang, Ao Sun, Yuxiang Huang, Kaihuo Zhang, Weilun Zhao, Yuxuan Li, Jianyong Wang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass. While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Kuo, Jingyang Zhang, Jianyi Zhang, Minxue Tang, Louis DiValentin, Aolin Ding, Jingwei Sun, William Chen, Amin Hass, Tianlong Chen, Yiran Chen, Hai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), increasing research has recognized their risk of leaking personally identifiable information (PII) under malicious attacks. Although efforts have been made to protect PII in LLMs, existing methods struggle to balance privacy protection with maintaining model utility. In this paper, inspired by studies of amnesia in cognitive science, we propose a novel approach, Proactive Privacy Amnesia (PPA), to safeguard PII in LLMs while preserving their utility. This mechanism works by actively identifying and forgetting key memories most closely associated with PII in sequences, followed by a memory implanting using suitable substitute memories to maintain the LLM's functionality. We conduct evaluations across multiple models to protect common PII, such as phone numbers and physical addresses, against prevalent PII-targeted attacks, demonstrating the superiority of our method compared with other existing defensive techniques. The results show that our PPA method completely eliminates the risk of phone number exposure by 100% and significantly reduces the risk of physical address exposure by 9.8% - 87.6%, all while maintaining comparable model utility performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Wu, Haoling Li, Xin Zhang, Jianwen Luo, Yangyu Huang, Ruihang Chu, Yujiu Yang, Scarlett Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from
  candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854">(How) Do Language Models Track State?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Belinda Z. Li, Zifan Carl Guo, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faiz Surani, Mirac Suzgun, Vyoma Raman, Christopher D. Manning, Peter Henderson, Daniel E. Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal reform can be challenging in light of the volume, complexity, and interdependence of laws, codes, and records. One salient example of this challenge is the effort to restrict and remove racially restrictive covenants, clauses in property deeds that historically barred individuals of specific races from purchasing homes. Despite the Supreme Court holding such racial covenants unenforceable in 1948, they persist in property records across the United States. Many jurisdictions have moved to identify and strike these provisions, including California, which mandated in 2021 that all counties implement such a process. Yet the scale can be overwhelming, with Santa Clara County (SCC) alone having over 24 million property deed documents, making purely manual review infeasible. We present a novel approach to addressing this pressing issue, developed through a partnership with the SCC Clerk-Recorder's Office. First, we leverage an open large language model, finetuned to detect racial covenants with high precision and recall. We estimate that this system reduces manual efforts by 86,500 person hours and costs less than 2% of the cost for a comparable off-the-shelf closed model. Second, we illustrate the County's integration of this model into responsible operational practice, including legal review and the creation of a historical registry, and release our model to assist the hundreds of jurisdictions engaged in similar efforts. Finally, our results reveal distinct periods of utilization of racial covenants, sharp geographic clustering, and the disproportionate role of a small number of developers in maintaining housing discrimination. We estimate that by 1950, one in four properties across the County were subject to racial covenants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Li, Jiexiong Liu, Yixuan Chen, Yanqin Jia, Zhepeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they face challenges such as low computational efficiency, gradient vanishing, and difficulties in capturing complex feature interactions. To address these limitations, a novel framework has been proposed. This framework incorporates a learnable dense residual skip connection mechanism, a TransformerX module a transformer based component integrating multiscale convolution and adaptive activation functions and a multitoken prediction interaction module. The learnable dense residual connections enhance information flow and feature capture across layers. Within the TransformerX module, large convolutional kernels aggregate semantic information from extensive text segments, while smaller convolutions focus on local word order and syntactic structures. The adaptive activation function dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the semantic features of the input text, improving the model's ability to handle diverse semantic expressions and complex relationships. The multitoken prediction module boosts data utilization and accelerates inference by predicting multiple future tokens. These components significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for adapting large language models (LLMs) to align with user intentions. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary hyperparameter decisions can make any arbitrary conclusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyamin Jamialahmadi, Parsa Kavehzadeh, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Parsa Farinneya, Hossein Rajabzadeh, Aref Jafari, Boxing Chen, Marzieh S. Tahaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is often hindered by strict computational and latency constraints. While dynamic inference offers the flexibility to adjust model behavior based on varying resource budgets, existing methods are frequently limited by hardware inefficiencies or performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce Balcony, a simple yet highly effective framework for depth-based dynamic inference. By freezing the pretrained LLM and inserting additional transformer layers at selected exit points, Balcony maintains the full model's performance while enabling real-time adaptation to different computational budgets. These additional layers are trained using a straightforward self-distillation loss, aligning the sub-model outputs with those of the full model. This approach requires significantly fewer training tokens and tunable parameters, drastically reducing computational costs compared to prior methods. When applied to the LLaMA3-8B model, using only 0.2% of the original pretraining data, Balcony achieves minimal performance degradation while enabling significant speedups. Remarkably, we show that Balcony outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Flextron and Layerskip as well as other leading compression techniques on multiple models and at various scales, across a variety of benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable performance across a wide range of language understanding and mathematical tasks. As a result, increasing attention has been given to assessing the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs, driving research into commonsense, numerical, logical, and qualitative reasoning. However, with the rapid progress of reasoning-focused models such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, there has been a growing demand for reasoning benchmarks that can keep pace with ongoing model developments. In this paper, we introduce MastermindEval, a simple, scalable, and interpretable deductive reasoning benchmark inspired by the board game Mastermind. Our benchmark supports two evaluation paradigms: (1) agentic evaluation, in which the model autonomously plays the game, and (2) deductive reasoning evaluation, in which the model is given a pre-played game state with only one possible valid code to infer. In our experimental results we (1) find that even easy Mastermind instances are difficult for current models and (2) demonstrate that the benchmark is scalable to possibly more advanced models in the future Furthermore, we investigate possible reasons why models cannot deduce the final solution and find that current models are limited in deducing the concealed code as the number of statement to combine information from is increasing.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce our first-generation reasoning model, LexPro-1.0, a large language model designed for the highly specialized Chinese legal domain, offering comprehensive capabilities to meet diverse realistic needs. Existing legal LLMs face two primary challenges. Firstly, their design and evaluation are predominantly driven by computer science perspectives, leading to insufficient incorporation of legal expertise and logic, which is crucial for high-precision legal applications, such as handling complex prosecutorial tasks. Secondly, these models often underperform due to a lack of comprehensive training data from the legal domain, limiting their ability to effectively address real-world legal scenarios. To address this, we first compile millions of legal documents covering over 20 types of crimes from 31 provinces in China for model training. From the extensive dataset, we further select high-quality for supervised fine-tuning, ensuring enhanced relevance and precision. The model further undergoes large-scale reinforcement learning without additional supervision, emphasizing the enhancement of its reasoning capabilities and explainability. To validate its effectiveness in complex legal applications, we also conduct human evaluations with legal experts. We develop fine-tuned models based on DeepSeek-R1-Distilled versions, available in three dense configurations: 14B, 32B, and 70B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingzhe Peng, Gongrui Zhang, Miaosen Zhang, Zhiyuan You, Jie Liu, Qipeng Zhu, Kai Yang, Xingzhong Xu, Xin Geng, Xu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges from the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning, particularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural constraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.
  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LMM-R1}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.
  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that LMM-R1 achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative spoken language models produce speech in a wide range of voices, prosody, and recording conditions, seemingly approaching the diversity of natural speech. However, the extent to which generated speech is acoustically diverse remains unclear due to a lack of appropriate metrics. We address this gap by developing lightweight metrics of acoustic diversity, which we collectively refer to as MAD Speech. We focus on measuring five facets of acoustic diversity: voice, gender, emotion, accent, and background noise. We construct the metrics as a composition of specialized, per-facet embedding models and an aggregation function that measures diversity within the embedding space. Next, we build a series of datasets with a priori known diversity preferences for each facet. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve a stronger agreement with the ground-truth diversity than baselines. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our proposed metrics across several real-life evaluation scenarios. MAD Speech is made publicly accessible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: While unlearning knowledge from large language models (LLMs) is receiving increasing attention, one important aspect remains unexplored. Existing approaches and benchmarks assume data points to-be-forgotten are independent, ignoring their inter-connectivity - a fundamental characteristic of real-world data structures. In this paper, we propose PISTOL, a method for compiling structural datasets. PISTOL leverages the inherently structured nature of contractual relationships, offering several key benefits. First, it enables insights into the impact of structural data on unlearning effectiveness. Second, it provides precise and concise ground truths for clearer evaluation. Third, its attribute generation does not require input from pre-trained LLMs, mitigating confounding risks. Leveraging datasets synthesized using PISTOL, we demonstrate how data inter-connectivity impacts LLM unlearning. Specifically, (a) in both the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, unlearning difficulty increases as data inter-connectivity grows, (b) there is a positive correlation between the density of the knowledge graph and unlearning difficulty, and (c) when the to-be-forgotten data is skewed towards one domain, balancing retaining performance across all domains is challenging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The impact of social media on critical issues such as echo chambers needs to be addressed, as these phenomena can have disruptive consequences for our society. Traditional research often oversimplifies emotional tendencies and opinion evolution into numbers and formulas, neglecting that news and communication are conveyed through text, which limits these approaches. Hence, in this work, we propose an LLM-based simulation for the social opinion network to evaluate and counter polarization phenomena. We first construct three typical network structures to simulate different characteristics of social interactions. Then, agents interact based on recommendation algorithms and update their strategies through reasoning and analysis. By comparing these interactions with the classic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), the Friedkin Johnsen (FJ) model, and using echo chamber-related indices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in simulating opinion dynamics and reproducing phenomena such as opinion polarization and echo chambers. We propose two mitigation methods, active and passive nudges, that can help reduce echo chambers, specifically within language-based simulations. We hope our work will offer valuable insights and guidance for social polarization mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4x increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Tang, Ao Qu, Zhaokai Wang, Dingyi Zhuang, Zhaofeng Wu, Wei Ma, Shenhao Wang, Yunhan Zheng, Zhan Zhao, Jinhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of these tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model solely on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving, with generalized improvements in real-world visual-spatial tasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle: a framework that uses synthetic data generation to provide targeted supervision for vision language models (VLMs) in three basic spatial capabilities, creating an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These findings offer insights into systematic strategies for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nate Gillman, Daksh Aggarwal, Michael Freeman, Saurabh Singh, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Wijmans, Brody Huval, Alexander Hertzberg, Vladlen Koltun, Philipp Kr\"ahenb\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one single layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds up a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary items and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than the rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that computes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens into global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom kernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction over the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the Gemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss computation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption of the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we leverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the gradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision) contribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic reduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training speed or convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Kimhi, Idan Kashani, Avi Mendelson, Chaim Baskin</p>
<p>Abstract: The widely used ReLU is favored for its hardware efficiency, {as the implementation at inference is a one bit sign case,} yet suffers from issues such as the ``dying ReLU'' problem, where during training, neurons fail to activate and constantly remain at zero, as highlighted by Lu et al. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunsheng Ma, Burhaneddin Yaman, Xin Ye, Jingru Luo, Feng Tao, Abhirup Mallik, Ziran Wang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heejeong Nam, Jinwoo Ahn, Keummin Ka, Jiwan Chung, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human communication often relies on visual cues to resolve ambiguity. While humans can intuitively integrate these cues, AI systems often find it challenging to engage in sophisticated multimodal reasoning. We introduce VAGUE, a benchmark evaluating multimodal AI systems' ability to integrate visual context for intent disambiguation. VAGUE consists of 1.6K ambiguous textual expressions, each paired with an image and multiple-choice interpretations, where the correct answer is only apparent with visual context. The dataset spans both staged, complex (Visual Commonsense Reasoning) and natural, personal (Ego4D) scenes, ensuring diversity. Our experiments reveal that existing multimodal AI models struggle to infer the speaker's true intent. While performance consistently improves from the introduction of more visual cues, the overall accuracy remains far below human performance, highlighting a critical gap in multimodal reasoning. Analysis of failure cases demonstrates that current models fail to distinguish true intent from superficial correlations in the visual scene, indicating that they perceive images but do not effectively reason with them. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Hazel-Heejeong-Nam/VAGUE.git.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18203">Critic-V: VLM Critics Help Catch VLM Errors in Multimodal Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Zhang, Junxian Li, Jingdi Lei, Xunzhi Wang, Yujie Liu, Zonglin Yang, Jiatong Li, Weida Wang, Suorong Yang, Jianbo Wu, Peng Ye, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zukang Xu, Yuxuan Yue, Xing Hu, Zhihang Yuan, Zixu Jiang, Zhixuan Chen, Jiangyong Yu, Chen Xu, Sifan Zhou, Dawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba is an efficient sequence model that rivals Transformers and demonstrates significant potential as a foundational architecture for various tasks. Quantization is commonly used in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to Mamba remains underexplored, and existing quantization methods, which have been effective for CNN and Transformer models, appear inadequate for Mamba models (e.g., Quarot suffers a 21% accuracy drop on Vim-T$^\dagger$ even under W8A8). We have pioneered the exploration of this issue and identified several key challenges. First, significant outliers are present in gate projections, output projections, and matrix multiplications. Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan further amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the variance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent. To these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced rotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel distributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and can merge additional parameters into model weights. Experiments show that MambaQuant can quantize both weights and activations into 8-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss for Mamba-based vision and language tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MambaQuant is the first comprehensive PTQ design for the Mamba family, paving the way for further advancements in its application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonsang Kim, Zainab Aamir, Mithilesh Singh, Saeed Boorboor, Klaus Mueller, Arie E. Kaufman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Explainable XR, an end-to-end framework for analyzing user behavior in diverse eXtended Reality (XR) environments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data interpretation assistance. Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Rudman, Michal Golovanesky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Cui, Johnny Tian-Zheng Wei, Swabha Swayamdipta, Robin Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Data watermarking in language models injects traceable signals, such as specific token sequences or stylistic patterns, into copyrighted text, allowing copyright holders to track and verify training data ownership. Previous data watermarking techniques primarily focus on effective memorization after pretraining, while overlooking challenges that arise in other stages of the LLM pipeline, such as the risk of watermark filtering during data preprocessing, or potential forgetting through post-training, or verification difficulties due to API-only access. We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes. Our watermarks are designed to be memorized by the LLM through seamlessly integrating in its training data, making them harder to detect lexically during preprocessing. We demonstrate that our watermarks can be effectively memorized by LLMs, and that increasing our watermarks' density, length, and diversity of attributes strengthens their memorization. We further show that our watermarks remain robust throughout LLM development, maintaining their effectiveness after continual pretraining and supervised finetuning. Finally, we show that our data watermarks can be evaluated even under API-only access via question answering.</p>

We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework's validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizheng Sun, Hao Li, Chang Xu, Chenghua Lin, Riza Batista-Navarro, Jingyuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have excelled in visual reasoning but often incur high computational costs. One key reason is the redundancy of visual tokens. Although recent token reduction methods claim to achieve minimal performance loss, our extensive experiments reveal that token reduction can substantially alter a model's output distribution, leading to changes in prediction patterns that standard metrics such as accuracy loss do not fully capture. Such inconsistencies are especially concerning for practical applications where system stability is critical. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyze how token reduction influences the energy distribution of a VLM's internal representations using a lower-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our results show that changes in the Inverse Participation Ratio of the singular value spectrum are strongly correlated with the model's consistency after token reduction. Based on these insights, we propose LoFi--a training-free visual token reduction method that utilizes the leverage score from SVD for token pruning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LoFi not only reduces computational costs with minimal performance degradation but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of output consistency.</p>
