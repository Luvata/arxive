<p><b>Authors:</b> Enora Rice, Ali Marashian, Hannah Haynie, Katharina von der Wense, Alexis Palmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer learning is an invaluable tool for overcoming data scarcity, yet selecting a suitable transfer language remains a challenge. The precise roles of linguistic typology, training data, and model architecture in transfer language choice are not fully understood. We take a holistic approach, examining how both dataset-specific and fine-grained typological features influence transfer language selection for part-of-speech tagging, considering two different sources for morphosyntactic features. While previous work examines these dynamics in the context of bilingual biLSTMS, we extend our analysis to a more modern transfer learning pipeline: zero-shot prediction with pretrained multilingual models. We train a series of transfer language ranking systems and examine how different feature inputs influence ranker performance across architectures. Word overlap, type-token ratio, and genealogical distance emerge as top features across all architectures. Our findings reveal that a combination of typological and dataset-dependent features leads to the best rankings, and that good performance can be obtained with either feature group on its own.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine translation for low resource language pairs is a challenging task. This task could become extremely difficult once a speaker uses code switching. We propose a method to build a machine translation model for code-switched Kazakh-Russian language pair with no labeled data. Our method is basing on generation of synthetic data. Additionally, we present the first codeswitching Kazakh-Russian parallel corpus and the evaluation results, which include a model achieving 16.48 BLEU almost reaching an existing commercial system and beating it by human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsook Lee, AJ Alvero, Thorsten Joachims, Ren\'e Kizilcec</p>
<p>Abstract: People are increasingly using technologies equipped with large language models (LLM) to write texts for formal communication, which raises two important questions at the intersection of technology and society: Who do LLMs write like (model alignment); and can LLMs be prompted to change who they write like (model steerability). We investigate these questions in the high-stakes context of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing lexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to two types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question used by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic information about each applicant. We consistently find that both types of LLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays, regardless of the specific model and analytical approach. Further, prompting a specific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the model with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity group. This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation status, and geographic location. The demographically prompted and unprompted synthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text, meaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. These issues of model alignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs in high-stakes contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Minixhofer, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods predominantly require the same tokenizer between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable cross-tokenizer distillation without a next-token prediction loss as the main objective, instead purely maximizing the student predictions' similarity to the teacher's predictions (known as pure distillation), while also being robust to large mismatches between the teacher and the student tokenizer function and vocabulary. Empirically, our method enables substantially improved performance as tested on two use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedently effective transfer across tokenizers. We transfer (subword-level) Llama and Gemma models to byte-level tokenization more effectively than prior methods transfer to a similar subword tokenizer under a comparable training budget. Transferring different base models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling them (e.g., via averaging their predicted probabilities) which boosts performance. Second, we use our cross-tokenizer distillation method to distil a large maths-specialized LLM into a smaller model, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Overall, our results make substantial strides toward better adaptability and enhanced interaction between different LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20088">Generative Linguistics, Large Language Models, and the Social Nature of Scientific Success</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophie Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Chesi's (forthcoming) target paper depicts a generative linguistics in crisis, foreboded by Piantadosi's (2023) declaration that "modern language models refute Chomsky's approach to language." In order to survive, Chesi warns, generativists must hold themselves to higher standards of formal and empirical rigor. This response argues that the crisis described by Chesi and Piantadosi actually has little to do with rigor, but is rather a reflection of generativists' limited social ambitions. Chesi ties the fate of generative linguistics to its intellectual merits, but the current success of language model research is social in nature as much as it is intellectual. In order to thrive, then, generativists must do more than heed Chesi's call for rigor; they must also expand their ambitions by giving outsiders a stake in their future success.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20103">Bigger But Not Better: Small Neural Language Models Outperform Large Language Models in Detection of Thought Disorder</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Changye Li, Weizhe Xu, Serguei Pakhomov, Ellen Bradley, Dror Ben-Zeev, Trevor Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Disorganized thinking is a key diagnostic indicator of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Recently, clinical estimates of the severity of disorganized thinking have been shown to correlate with measures of how difficult speech transcripts would be for large language models (LLMs) to predict. However, LLMs' deployment challenges -- including privacy concerns, computational and financial costs, and lack of transparency of training data -- limit their clinical utility. We investigate whether smaller neural language models can serve as effective alternatives for detecting positive formal thought disorder, using the same sliding window based perplexity measurements that proved effective with larger models. Surprisingly, our results show that smaller models are more sensitive to linguistic differences associated with formal thought disorder than their larger counterparts. Detection capability declines beyond a certain model size and context length, challenging the common assumption of ``bigger is better'' for LLM-based applications. Our findings generalize across audio diaries and clinical interview speech samples from individuals with psychotic symptoms, suggesting a promising direction for developing efficient, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving screening tools that can be deployed in both clinical and naturalistic settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20104">&quot;Is There Anything Else?&#x27;&#x27;: Examining Administrator Influence on Linguistic Features from the Cookie Theft Picture Description Cognitive Test</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Changye Li, Zhecheng Sheng, Trevor Cohen, Serguei Pakhomov</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that negatively impacts patients' cognitive ability. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in naturalistic language samples can be useful for early screening of AD dementia. However, the nature of language deficits often requires test administrators to use various speech elicitation techniques during spontaneous language assessments to obtain enough propositional utterances from dementia patients. This could lead to the ``observer's effect'' on the downstream analysis that has not been fully investigated. Our study seeks to quantify the influence of test administrators on linguistic features in dementia assessment with two English corpora the ``Cookie Theft'' picture description datasets collected at different locations and test administrators show different levels of administrator involvement. Our results show that the level of test administrator involvement significantly impacts observed linguistic features in patient speech. These results suggest that many of significant linguistic features in the downstream classification task may be partially attributable to differences in the test administration practices rather than solely to participants' cognitive status. The variations in test administrator behavior can lead to systematic biases in linguistic data, potentially confounding research outcomes and clinical assessments. Our study suggests that there is a need for a more standardized test administration protocol in the development of responsible clinical speech analytics frameworks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20110">Efficient Model Development through Fine-tuning Transfer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pin-Jie Lin, Rishab Balasubramanian, Fengyuan Liu, Nikhil Kandpal, Tu Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs struggle with efficient updates, as each new pretrained model version requires repeating expensive alignment processes. This challenge also applies to domain- or language-specific models, where fine-tuning on specialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this paper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions. Specifically, we derive the diff vector from one source model version, which represents the weight changes from fine-tuning, and apply it to the base model of a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various open-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can significantly improve the target base model, often achieving performance comparable to its fine-tuned counterpart. For example, reusing the fine-tuning updates from Llama 3.0 8B leads to an absolute accuracy improvement of 10.7% on GPQA over the base Llama 3.1 8B without additional training, surpassing Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. In a multilingual model development setting, we show that this approach can significantly increase performance on target-language tasks without retraining, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.7% and 15.5% on Global MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively, compared to Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. Our controlled experiments reveal that fine-tuning transfer is most effective when the source and target models are linearly connected in the parameter space. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning transfer offers a stronger and more computationally efficient starting point for further fine-tuning. Finally, we propose an iterative recycling-then-finetuning approach for continuous model development, which improves both efficiency and effectiveness. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning transfer is a viable strategy to reduce training costs while maintaining model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) studies in genomic repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is vital for cancer research yet remains challenging due to semantic ambiguity, extreme class imbalance, and limited labeled data in low-resource settings. We present ProtoBERT-LoRA, a hybrid framework that combines PubMedBERT with prototypical networks and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model enforces class-separable embeddings via episodic prototype training while preserving biomedical domain knowledge. Our dataset was divided as: Training (20 positive, 20 negative), Prototype Set (10 positive, 10 negative), Validation (20 positive, 200 negative), and Test (71 positive, 765 negative). Evaluated on test dataset, ProtoBERT-LoRA achieved F1-score of 0.624 (precision: 0.481, recall: 0.887), outperforming the rule-based system, machine learning baselines and finetuned PubMedBERT. Application to 44,287 unlabeled studies reduced manual review efforts by 82%. Ablation studies confirmed that combining prototypes with LoRA improved performance by 29% over stand-alone LoRA.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20182">Leveraging Implicit Sentiments: Enhancing Reliability and Validity in Psychological Trait Evaluation of LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanhuan Ma, Haisong Gong, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, Dongkuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their increasing integration into human life. With the transition from mere tools to human-like assistants, understanding their psychological aspects-such as emotional tendencies and personalities-becomes essential for ensuring their trustworthiness. However, current psychological evaluations of LLMs, often based on human psychological assessments like the BFI, face significant limitations. The results from these approaches often lack reliability and have limited validity when predicting LLM behavior in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel evaluation instrument specifically designed for LLMs, called Core Sentiment Inventory (CSI). CSI is a bilingual tool, covering both English and Chinese, that implicitly evaluates models' sentiment tendencies, providing an insightful psychological portrait of LLM across three dimensions: optimism, pessimism, and neutrality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that: 1) CSI effectively captures nuanced emotional patterns, revealing significant variation in LLMs across languages and contexts; 2) Compared to current approaches, CSI significantly improves reliability, yielding more consistent results; and 3) The correlation between CSI scores and the sentiment of LLM's real-world outputs exceeds 0.85, demonstrating its strong validity in predicting LLM behavior.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhouhong Gu, Xingzhou Chen, Xiaoran Shi, Tao Wang, Suhang Zheng, Tianyu Li, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints. While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO. Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Gao, Yihua Bao, Dongdong Weng, Jiayi Zhao, Jia Li, Yan Zhou, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation enhances human-computer interaction realism through speech-synchronized gesture synthesis. However, generating semantically meaningful gestures remains a challenging problem. We propose SARGes, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse speech content and generate reliable semantic gesture labels, which subsequently guide the synthesis of meaningful co-speech gestures.First, we constructed a comprehensive co-speech gesture ethogram and developed an LLM-based intent chain reasoning mechanism that systematically parses and decomposes gesture semantics into structured inference steps following ethogram criteria, effectively guiding LLMs to generate context-aware gesture labels. Subsequently, we constructed an intent chain-annotated text-to-gesture label dataset and trained a lightweight gesture label generation model, which then guides the generation of credible and semantically coherent co-speech gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that SARGes achieves highly semantically-aligned gesture labeling (50.2% accuracy) with efficient single-pass inference (0.4 seconds). The proposed method provides an interpretable intent reasoning pathway for semantic gesture synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose \textbf{Thinker-Talker} architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianhao Wu, Yu Wang, Ngoc Quach</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative leap with the advent of transformer-based architectures, which have significantly enhanced the ability of machines to understand and generate human-like text. This paper explores the advancements in transformer models, such as BERT and GPT, focusing on their superior performance in text understanding tasks compared to traditional methods like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By analyzing statistical properties through visual representations-including probability density functions of text length distributions and feature space classifications-the study highlights the models' proficiency in handling long-range dependencies, adapting to conditional shifts, and extracting features for classification, even with overlapping classes. Drawing on recent 2024 research, including enhancements in multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning and context-aware chat interactions, the paper outlines a methodology involving data preparation, model selection, pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD, with F1 scores exceeding 90%, though challenges such as high computational costs persist. This work underscores the pivotal role of transformers in modern NLP and suggests future directions, including efficiency optimization and multimodal integration, to further advance language-based AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sejin Lee, Jian Kim, Haon Park, Ashkan Yousefpour, Sangyoon Yu, Min Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents, autonomously performing tasks within real desktop or web environments. While this evolution greatly expands practical use cases for humans, it also creates serious security exposures. We present SUDO (Screen-based Universal Detox2Tox Offense), a novel attack framework that systematically bypasses refusal trained safeguards in commercial computer-use agents, such as Claude Computer Use. The core mechanism, Detox2Tox, transforms harmful requests (that agents initially reject) into seemingly benign requests via detoxification, secures detailed instructions from advanced vision language models (VLMs), and then reintroduces malicious content via toxification just before execution. Unlike conventional jailbreaks, SUDO iteratively refines its attacks based on a built-in refusal feedback, making it increasingly effective against robust policy filters. In extensive tests spanning 50 real-world tasks and multiple state-of-the-art VLMs, SUDO achieves a stark attack success rate of 24% (with no refinement), and up to 41% (by its iterative refinement) in Claude Computer Use. By revealing these vulnerabilities and demonstrating the ease with which they can be exploited in real-world computing environments, this paper highlights an immediate need for robust, context-aware safeguards. WARNING: This paper includes harmful or offensive model outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Misgendering is the act of referring to someone by a gender that does not match their chosen identity. It marginalizes and undermines a person's sense of self, causing significant harm. English-based approaches have clear-cut approaches to avoiding misgendering, such as the use of the pronoun ``they''. However, other languages pose unique challenges due to both grammatical and cultural constructs. In this work we develop methodologies to assess and mitigate misgendering across 42 languages and dialects using a participatory-design approach to design effective and appropriate guardrails across all languages. We test these guardrails in a standard large language model-based application (meeting transcript summarization), where both the data generation and the annotation steps followed a human-in-the-loop approach. We find that the proposed guardrails are very effective in reducing misgendering rates across all languages in the summaries generated, and without incurring loss of quality. Our human-in-the-loop approach demonstrates a method to feasibly scale inclusive and responsible AI-based solutions across multiple languages and cultures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shih-Wen Ke, Guan-Yu Lai, Guo-Lin Fang, Hsi-Yuan Kao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are designed to align with human values in their responses. This study exploits LLMs with an iterative prompting technique where each prompt is systematically modified and refined across multiple iterations to enhance its effectiveness in jailbreaking attacks progressively. This technique involves analyzing the response patterns of LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, allowing us to adjust and optimize prompts to evade the LLMs' ethical and security constraints. Persuasion strategies enhance prompt effectiveness while maintaining consistency with malicious intent. Our results show that the attack success rates (ASR) increase as the attacking prompts become more refined with the highest ASR of 90% for GPT4 and ChatGLM and the lowest ASR of 68% for LLaMa2. Our technique outperforms baseline techniques (PAIR and PAP) in ASR and shows comparable performance with GCG and ArtPrompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghan Yu, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Humor plays a significant role in daily language communication. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language processing has made significant strides in understanding and generating various genres of texts. However, most LLMs exhibit poor performance in generating and processing Chinese humor. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive Chinese humor-related dataset, the Chinese Fun Set (CFunSet). This dataset aggregates existing Chinese humor datasets and includes over 20,000 jokes collected from Tieba-JokeBar, a Chinese online platform known for joke sharing. The resulting corpus comprises more than 160,000 entries. Leveraging CFunSet, we developed the Chinese Fun Model (CFunModel), the first large language model designed to handle various Chinese humor-related tasks including Crosstalk Response Selection, Humor Recognition, Joke Generation, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that CFunModel outperforms popular large language models in these tasks. Our CFunSet is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZhenghanYU/CFunSet and CFunModel is available at https://huggingface.co/ZhenghanYU/CFunModel.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Kempton, Stuart Burrell, Connor Cheverall</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for the zero-shot detection of machine-generated text are dominated by three statistical quantities: log-likelihood, log-rank, and entropy. As language models mimic the distribution of human text ever closer, this will limit our ability to build effective detection algorithms. To combat this, we introduce a method for detecting machine-generated text that is entirely agnostic of the generating language model. This is achieved by targeting a defect in the way that decoding strategies, such as temperature or top-k sampling, normalize conditional probability measures. This method can be rigorously theoretically justified, is easily explainable, and is conceptually distinct from existing methods for detecting machine-generated text. We evaluate our detector in the white and black box settings across various language models, datasets, and passage lengths. We also study the effect of paraphrasing attacks on our detector and the extent to which it is biased against non-native speakers. In each of these settings, the performance of our test is at least comparable to that of other state-of-the-art text detectors, and in some cases, we strongly outperform these baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aishik Mandal, Dana Atzil-Slonim, Thamar Solorio, Iryna Gurevych</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling condition that incurs substantial personal and societal costs. Current depression diagnosis involves determining the depression severity of a person through self-reported questionnaires or interviews conducted by clinicians. This often leads to delayed treatment and involves substantial human resources. Thus, several works try to automate the process using multimodal data. However, they usually overlook the following: i) The variable contribution of each modality for each question in the questionnaire and ii) Using ordinal classification for the task. This results in sub-optimal fusion and training methods. In this work, we propose a novel Question-wise Modality Fusion (QuestMF) framework trained with a novel Imbalanced Ordinal Log-Loss (ImbOLL) function to tackle these issues. The performance of our framework is comparable to the current state-of-the-art models on the E-DAIC dataset and enhances interpretability by predicting scores for each question. This will help clinicians identify an individual's symptoms, allowing them to customise their interventions accordingly. We also make the code for the QuestMF framework publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonor Barreiros, Isabel Coutinho, Gon\c{c}alo M. Correia, Bruno Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical coding is a critical task in healthcare, although traditional methods for automating clinical coding may not provide sufficient explicit evidence for coders in production environments. This evidence is crucial, as medical coders have to make sure there exists at least one explicit passage in the input health record that justifies the attribution of a code. We therefore propose to reframe the task as an entity linking problem, in which each document is annotated with its set of codes and respective textual evidence, enabling better human-machine collaboration. By leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), together with constrained decoding, we introduce three approaches to solve this problem that prove effective at disambiguating clinical mentions and that perform well in few-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhicheng Guo, Sijie Cheng, Yuchen Niu, Hao Wang, Sicheng Zhou, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in tool learning, where LLMs are augmented with external tools to tackle complex tasks. However, existing tool environments face challenges in balancing stability, scalability, and realness, particularly for benchmarking purposes. To address this problem, we propose MirrorAPI, a novel framework that trains specialized LLMs to accurately simulate real API responses, effectively acting as "mirrors" to tool environments. Using a comprehensive dataset of request-response pairs from 7,000+ APIs, we employ supervised fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance simulation fidelity. MirrorAPI achieves superior accuracy and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by its performance on the newly constructed MirrorAPI-Bench and its integration into StableToolBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy, particularly for complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, by employing detailed and comprehensive reasoning processes. However, generating these lengthy reasoning sequences is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this inefficiency, we leverage the inherent parallelizability of certain tasks to accelerate the reasoning process. Specifically, when multiple parallel reasoning branches exist, we decode multiple tokens per step using a specialized attention mask, processing them within a single sequence. Experimental results show that our method achieves over 100% speedup in decoding time while basically maintaining accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Niculae, Adrian Cosma, Emilian Radoi</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately mapping medical procedure names from healthcare providers to standardized terminology used by insurance companies is a crucial yet complex task. Inconsistencies in naming conventions lead to missclasified procedures, causing administrative inefficiencies and insurance claim problems in private healthcare settings. Many companies still use human resources for manual mapping, while there is a clear opportunity for automation. This paper proposes a retrieval-based architecture leveraging sentence embeddings for medical name matching in the Romanian healthcare system. This challenge is significantly more difficult in underrepresented languages such as Romanian, where existing pretrained language models lack domain-specific adaptation to medical text. We evaluate multiple embedding models, including Romanian, multilingual, and medical-domain-specific representations, to identify the most effective solution for this task. Our findings contribute to the broader field of medical NLP for low-resource languages such as Romanian.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present E3C-3.0, a multilingual dataset in the medical domain, comprising clinical cases annotated with diseases and test-result relations. The dataset includes both native texts in five languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish and Basque) and texts translated and projected from the English source into five target languages (Greek, Italian, Polish, Slovak, and Slovenian). A semi-automatic approach has been implemented, including automatic annotation projection based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and human revision. We present several experiments showing that current state-of-the-art LLMs can benefit from being fine-tuned on the E3C-3.0 dataset. We also show that transfer learning in different languages is very effective, mitigating the scarcity of data. Finally, we compare performance both on native data and on projected data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frances Yung, Varsha Suresh, Zaynab Reza, Mansoor Ahmad, Vera Demberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) -- the task of identifying the implicit coherence relation between two text spans -- requires deep semantic understanding. Recent studies have shown that zero- or few-shot approaches significantly lag behind supervised models, but LLMs may be useful for synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs generate a second argument following a specified coherence relation. We applied this approach in a cross-domain setting, generating discourse continuations using unlabelled target-domain data to adapt a base model which was trained on source-domain labelled data. Evaluations conducted on a large-scale test set revealed that different variations of the approach did not result in any significant improvements. We conclude that LLMs often fail to generate useful samples for IDRR, and emphasize the importance of considering both statistical significance and comparability when evaluating IDRR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Maisto</p>
<p>Abstract: Role-playing games (RPG) are games in which players interact with one another to create narratives. The role of players in the RPG is largely based on the interaction between players and their characters. This emerging form of shared narrative, primarily oral, is receiving increasing attention. In particular, many authors investigated the use of an LLM as an actor in the game. In this paper, we aim to discover to what extent the language of Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit oral or written features when asked to generate an RPG session without human interference. We will conduct a linguistic analysis of the lexical and syntactic features of the generated texts and compare the results with analyses of conversations, transcripts of human RPG sessions, and books. We found that LLMs exhibit a pattern that is distinct from all other text categories, including oral conversations, human RPG sessions and books. Our analysis has shown how training influences the way LLMs express themselves and provides important indications of the narrative capabilities of these tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wu, Yuxuan Yao, Shuqi Liu, Zehua Liu, Xiaojin Fu, Xiongwei Han, Xing Li, Hui-Ling Zhen, Tao Zhong, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking. However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raj Sanjay Shah, Lei Xu, Qianchu Liu, Jon Burnsky, Drew Bertagnolli, Chaitanya Shivade</p>
<p>Abstract: Behavioral therapy notes are important for both legal compliance and patient care. Unlike progress notes in physical health, quality standards for behavioral therapy notes remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, we collaborated with licensed therapists to design a comprehensive rubric for evaluating therapy notes across key dimensions: completeness, conciseness, and faithfulness. Further, we extend a public dataset of behavioral health conversations with therapist-written notes and LLM-generated notes, and apply our evaluation framework to measure their quality. We find that: (1) A rubric-based manual evaluation protocol offers more reliable and interpretable results than traditional Likert-scale annotations. (2) LLMs can mimic human evaluators in assessing completeness and conciseness but struggle with faithfulness. (3) Therapist-written notes often lack completeness and conciseness, while LLM-generated notes contain hallucination. Surprisingly, in a blind test, therapists prefer and judge LLM-generated notes to be superior to therapist-written notes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic similarity measures (SSMs) are widely used in biomedical research but remain underutilized in pharmacovigilance. This study evaluates six ontology-based SSMs for clustering MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) in drug safety data. Using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), we assess each method's ability to group PTs around medically meaningful centroids. A high-throughput framework was developed with a Java API and Python and R interfaces support large-scale similarity computations. Results show that while path-based methods perform moderately with F1 scores of 0.36 for WUPALMER and 0.28 for LCH, intrinsic information content (IC)-based measures, especially INTRINSIC-LIN and SOKAL, consistently yield better clustering accuracy (F1 score of 0.403). Validated against expert review and standard MedDRA queries (SMQs), our findings highlight the promise of IC-based SSMs in enhancing pharmacovigilance workflows by improving early signal detection and reducing manual review.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research shows that LLMs can simulate ``believable'' human behaviors to power LLM agents via prompt-only methods. In this work, we focus on evaluating and improving LLM's objective ``accuracy'' rather than the subjective ``believability'' in the web action generation task, leveraging a large-scale, real-world dataset collected from online shopping human actions. We present the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Llama, and Claude) on the task of web action generation. Our results show that fine-tuning LLMs on real-world behavioral data substantially improves their ability to generate actions compared to prompt-only methods. Furthermore, incorporating synthesized reasoning traces into model training leads to additional performance gains, demonstrating the value of explicit rationale in behavior modeling. This work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in behavior simulation and offers actionable insights into how real-world action data and reasoning augmentation can enhance the fidelity of LLM agents.</p>

Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

<p>Abstract: We introduce MCTS-RAG, a novel approach that enhances the reasoning capabilities of small language models on knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide relevant context and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine reasoning paths. MCTS-RAG dynamically integrates retrieval and reasoning through an iterative decision-making process. Unlike standard RAG methods, which typically retrieve information independently from reasoning and thus integrate knowledge suboptimally, or conventional MCTS reasoning, which depends solely on internal model knowledge without external facts, MCTS-RAG combines structured reasoning with adaptive retrieval. This integrated approach enhances decision-making, reduces hallucinations, and ensures improved factual accuracy and response consistency. The experimental results on multiple reasoning and knowledge-intensive datasets datasets (i.e., ComplexWebQA, GPQA, and FoolMeTwice) show that our method enables small-scale LMs to achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by effectively scaling inference-time compute, setting a new standard for reasoning in small-scale models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Mukul Ranjan, Aidar Myrzakhan, Jiacheng Liu, Bowei Guo, Shengkun Tang, Zhuang Liu, Yuanzhi Li, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have increased interest in deploying them on mobile devices for on-device AI applications. Mobile users interact differently with LLMs compared to desktop users, creating unique expectations and data biases. Current benchmark datasets primarily target at server and desktop environments, and there is a notable lack of extensive datasets specifically designed for mobile contexts. Additionally, mobile devices face strict limitations in storage and computing resources, constraining model size and capabilities, thus requiring optimized efficiency and prioritized knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-MMLU, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for mobile intelligence. It consists of 16,186 questions across 80 mobile-related fields, designed to evaluate LLM performance in realistic mobile scenarios. A challenging subset, Mobile-MMLU-Pro, provides advanced evaluation similar in size to MMLU-Pro but significantly more difficult than our standard full set. Both benchmarks use multiple-choice, order-invariant questions focused on practical mobile interactions, such as recipe suggestions, travel planning, and essential daily tasks. The dataset emphasizes critical mobile-specific metrics like inference latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and response quality, offering comprehensive insights into model performance under mobile constraints. Moreover, it prioritizes privacy and adaptability, assessing models' ability to perform on-device processing, maintain user privacy, and adapt to personalized usage patterns. Mobile-MMLU family offers a standardized framework for developing and comparing mobile-optimized LLMs, enabling advancements in productivity and decision-making within mobile computing environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Chen, Zicong Jiang, Zining Zhang, Bingsheng He, Pingyi Luo, Mian Lu, Yuqiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LogQuant, a groundbreaking 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in large language model (LLM) inference, delivering substantial memory savings while preserving superior performance. Previous methods either assume that later tokens are more important or attempt to predict important tokens based on earlier attention patterns. Both approaches, however, can result in performance bottlenecks or frequent mispredictions.
  LogQuant takes a different approach. By applying a log-based filtering mechanism, it selectively compresses the KV Cache across the entire context, achieving better performance with the same or even reduced memory footprint compared to existing methods. In benchmark tests, it enhances throughput by 25% and boosts batch size by 60% without increasing memory consumption. For challenging tasks such as Math and Code Completion, LogQuant improves accuracy by 40% to 200% at the same compression ratio, outperforming comparable techniques.LogQuant integrates effortlessly with popular inference frameworks like Python's transformers library. Implementation can be available in https://github.com/Concyclics/LogQuantKV.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the increasing gap between the proprietary search AI solutions, such as Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning Pro and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview, and their open-source counterparts. The main innovation introduced in ODS is to augment the reasoning capabilities of the latest open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can judiciously use web search tools to answer queries. Concretely, ODS consists of two components that work with a base LLM chosen by the user: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Reasoning Agent interprets the given task and completes it by orchestrating a sequence of actions that includes calling tools, one of which is the Open Search Tool. Open Search Tool is a novel web search tool that outperforms proprietary counterparts. Together with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses the existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. For example, on the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves the best existing baseline of the recently released GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy. ODS is a general framework for seamlessly augmenting any LLMs -- for example, DeepSeek-R1 that achieves 82.4% on SimpleQA and 30.1% on FRAMES -- with search and reasoning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance: 88.3% on SimpleQA and 75.3% on FRAMES.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Lin, Manoj Acharya, Anirban Roy, Susmit Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating Trojans in Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of many tasks where alignment data is LLM specific, as different LLMs have different Trojan triggers and trigger behaviors to be removed. In this paper, we introduce TeleLoRA (Teleporting Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel framework that synergizes model-specific alignment data across multiple LLMs to enable zero-shot Trojan mitigation on unseen LLMs without alignment data. TeleLoRA learns a unified generator of LoRA adapter weights by leveraging local activation information across multiple LLMs. This generator is designed to be permutation symmetric to generalize across models with different architectures and sizes. We optimize the model design for memory efficiency, making it feasible to learn with large-scale LLMs with minimal computational resources. Experiments on LLM Trojan mitigation benchmarks demonstrate that TeleLoRA effectively reduces attack success rates while preserving the benign performance of the models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqin Tu, Weitao Feng, Hardy Chen, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Process-supervised reward models serve as a fine-grained function that provides detailed step-wise feedback to model responses, facilitating effective selection of reasoning trajectories for complex tasks. Despite its advantages, evaluation on PRMs remains less explored, especially in the multimodal domain. To address this gap, this paper first benchmarks current vision large language models (VLLMs) as two types of reward models: output reward models (ORMs) and process reward models (PRMs) on multiple vision-language benchmarks, which reveal that neither ORM nor PRM consistently outperforms across all tasks, and superior VLLMs do not necessarily yield better rewarding performance. To further advance evaluation, we introduce ViLBench, a vision-language benchmark designed to require intensive process reward signals. Notably, OpenAI's GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) achieves only 27.3% accuracy, indicating the benchmark's challenge for current VLLMs. Lastly, we preliminarily showcase a promising pathway towards bridging the gap between general VLLMs and reward models -- by collecting 73.6K vision-language process reward data using an enhanced tree-search algorithm, our 3B model is able to achieve an average improvement of 3.3% over standard CoT and up to 2.5% compared to its untrained counterpart on ViLBench by selecting OpenAI o1's generations. We release the implementations at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/ViLBench with our code, model, and data.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Vogel, Walid Bousselham, Anna Kukleva, Nina Shvetsova, Hilde Kuehne</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have shown impressive capabilities across various zero-shot tasks, including training-free localization and grounding, primarily focusing on localizing objects in images. However, leveraging those capabilities to localize actions and events in videos is challenging, as actions have less physical outline and are usually described by higher-level concepts. In this work, we propose VideoGEM, the first training-free spatial action grounding method based on pretrained image- and video-language backbones. Namely, we adapt the self-self attention formulation of GEM to spatial activity grounding. We observe that high-level semantic concepts, such as actions, usually emerge in the higher layers of the image- and video-language models. We, therefore, propose a layer weighting in the self-attention path to prioritize higher layers. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic weighting method to automatically tune layer weights to capture each layer`s relevance to a specific prompt. Finally, we introduce a prompt decomposition, processing action, verb, and object prompts separately, resulting in a better spatial localization of actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on three image- and video-language backbones, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and ViCLIP, and on four video grounding datasets, V-HICO, DALY, YouCook-Interactions, and GroundingYouTube, showing that the proposed training-free approach is able to outperform current trained state-of-the-art approaches for spatial video grounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Cheng, Ruiliang Lyu, Xiaotao Gu, Xiao Liu, Jiazheng Xu, Yida Lu, Jiayan Teng, Zhuoyi Yang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks. These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured. This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos. Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks. Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness. The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach. First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment. Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods. Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liza Darwesh, Jaspreet Singh, Marin Marian, Eduard Alexa, Koen Hindriks, Kim Baraka</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the elicitation of empathy toward a third party through interaction with social agents. Participants engaged with either a physical robot or a voice-enabled chatbot, both driven by a large language model (LLM) programmed to exhibit either an empathetic tone or remain neutral. The interaction is focused on a fictional character, Katie Banks, who is in a challenging situation and in need of financial donations. The willingness to help Katie, measured by the number of hours participants were willing to volunteer, along with their perceptions of the agent, were assessed for 60 participants. Results indicate that neither robotic embodiment nor empathetic tone significantly influenced participants' willingness to volunteer. While the LLM effectively simulated human empathy, fostering genuine empathetic responses in participants proved challenging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Guo, Huiwu Liu, Xiaolong Chen, Yuming Xie, Liang Zhang, Tao Han, Hechang Chen, Yi Chang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating functional test scripts, which necessitates understanding the dynamically evolving code structure of the target software. To achieve this, we propose a case-based reasoning (CBR) system utilizing a 4R cycle (i.e., retrieve, reuse, revise, and retain), which maintains and leverages a case bank of test intent descriptions and corresponding test scripts to facilitate LLMs for test script generation. To improve user experience further, we introduce Re4, an optimization method for the CBR system, comprising reranking-based retrieval finetuning and reinforced reuse finetuning. Specifically, we first identify positive examples with high semantic and script similarity, providing reliable pseudo-labels for finetuning the retriever model without costly labeling. Then, we apply supervised finetuning, followed by a reinforcement learning finetuning stage, to align LLMs with our production scenarios, ensuring the faithful reuse of retrieved cases. Extensive experimental results on two product development units from Huawei Datacom demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CBR+Re4. Notably, we also show that the proposed Re4 method can help alleviate the repetitive generation issues with LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thematic analysis (TA) is a widely used qualitative approach for uncovering latent meanings in unstructured text data. TA provides valuable insights in healthcare but is resource-intensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been introduced to perform TA, yet their applications in healthcare remain unexplored. Here, we propose TAMA: A Human-AI Collaborative Thematic Analysis framework using Multi-Agent LLMs for clinical interviews. We leverage the scalability and coherence of multi-agent systems through structured conversations between agents and coordinate the expertise of cardiac experts in TA. Using interview transcripts from parents of children with Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery (AAOCA), a rare congenital heart disease, we demonstrate that TAMA outperforms existing LLM-assisted TA approaches, achieving higher thematic hit rate, coverage, and distinctiveness. TAMA demonstrates strong potential for automated TA in clinical settings by leveraging multi-agent LLM systems with human-in-the-loop integration by enhancing quality while significantly reducing manual workload.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Yongjie Ye, Bingru Li, Yuxiang Nie, Jinghui Lu, Jingqun Tang, Yanjie Wang, Can Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Vision as LoRA (VoRA), a novel paradigm for transforming an LLM into an MLLM. Unlike prevalent MLLM architectures that rely on external vision modules for vision encoding, VoRA internalizes visual capabilities by integrating vision-specific LoRA layers directly into the LLM. This design allows the added parameters to be seamlessly merged into the LLM during inference, eliminating structural complexity and minimizing computational overhead. Moreover, inheriting the LLM's ability of handling flexible context, VoRA can process inputs at arbitrary resolutions.
  To further strengthen VoRA's visual capabilities, we introduce a block-wise distillation method that transfers visual priors from a pre-trained ViT into the LoRA layers, effectively accelerating training by injecting visual knowledge. Additionally, we apply bi-directional attention masks to better capture the context information of an image. We successfully demonstrate that with additional pre-training data, VoRA can perform comparably with conventional encode-based MLLMs. All training data, codes, and model weights will be released at https://github.com/Hon-Wong/VoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Liu, Changyu Chen, Wenjun Li, Penghui Qi, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Wee Sun Lee, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cl\'ement Guerner, Tianyu Liu, Anej Svete, Alexander Warstadt, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: The linear subspace hypothesis (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) states that, in a language model's representation space, all information about a concept such as verbal number is encoded in a linear subspace. Prior work has relied on auxiliary classification tasks to identify and evaluate candidate subspaces that might give support for this hypothesis. We instead give a set of intrinsic criteria which characterize an ideal linear concept subspace and enable us to identify the subspace using only the language model distribution. Our information-theoretic framework accounts for spuriously correlated features in the representation space (Kumar et al., 2022) by reconciling the statistical notion of concept information and the geometric notion of how concepts are encoded in the representation space. As a byproduct of this analysis, we hypothesize a causal process for how a language model might leverage concepts during generation. Empirically, we find that linear concept erasure is successful in erasing most concept information under our framework for verbal number as well as some complex aspect-level sentiment concepts from a restaurant review dataset. Our causal intervention for controlled generation shows that, for at least one concept across two languages models, the concept subspace can be used to manipulate the concept value of the generated word with precision.</p>

This is a continuous and scalable representation, self-supervised from the value-relevant output of 8 LLMs and evaluated on 15 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through UniVaR, we visualize and explore how LLMs prioritize different values in 25 languages and cultures, shedding light on complex interplay between human values and language modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023) SFR-Embedding-Mistral (Meng et al., 2024), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,1 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-mixing, the integration of lexical and grammatical elements from multiple languages within a single sentence, is a widespread linguistic phenomenon, particularly prevalent in multilingual societies. In India, social media users frequently engage in code-mixed conversations using the Roman script, especially among migrant communities who form online groups to share relevant local information. This paper focuses on the challenges of extracting relevant information from code-mixed conversations, specifically within Roman transliterated Bengali mixed with English. This study presents a novel approach to address these challenges by developing a mechanism to automatically identify the most relevant answers from code-mixed conversations. We have experimented with a dataset comprising of queries and documents from Facebook, and Query Relevance files (QRels) to aid in this task. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting pertinent information from complex, code-mixed digital conversations, contributing to the broader field of natural language processing in multilingual and informal text environments. We use GPT-3.5 Turbo via prompting alongwith using the sequential nature of relevant documents to frame a mathematical model which helps to detect relevant documents corresponding to a query.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael C. Wood, Adam A. Forbes</p>
<p>Abstract: The issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in enterprise and other high-stakes applications. Despite advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve more than 80% accuracy in generating faithful and factually correct outputs, even when provided with relevant and accurate context. In this work, we introduce Acurai, a novel systematic approach that achieves 100% hallucination-free responses in LLMs by reformatting queries and context data prior to input. Leveraging a deep understanding of LLM internal representations, the importance of noun-phrase dominance, and the role of discrete functional units (DFUs), Acurai ensures alignment between input context and generated output. We validate this method using the RAGTruth corpus, demonstrating its ability to eliminate 100% hallucinations for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Acurai sets a new standard for achieving consistent, accurate, and faithful AI responses, marking a significant step forward in the development of trustworthy AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenni Bi, Kai Han, Chuanjian Liu, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a significant challenge. While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Katrix, Quentin Carroway, Rowan Hawkesbury, Matthias Heathfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Context-aware processing mechanisms have increasingly become a critical area of exploration for improving the semantic and contextual capabilities of language generation models. The Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism (CASRM) was introduced as a novel framework designed to address limitations in coherence, contextual adaptability, and error propagation in large-scale text generation tasks. Through the integration of dynamically generated context vectors and attention modulation layers, CASRM enhances the alignment between token-level representations and broader contextual dependencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated significant improvements in semantic coherence across multiple domains, including technical, conversational, and narrative text. The ability to adapt to unseen domains and ambiguous inputs was evaluated using a diverse set of test scenarios, highlighting the robustness of the proposed mechanism. A detailed computational analysis revealed that while CASRM introduces additional processing overhead, the gains in linguistic precision and contextual relevance outweigh the marginal increase in complexity. The framework also successfully mitigates error propagation in sequential tasks, improving performance in dialogue continuation and multi-step text synthesis. Additional investigations into token-level attention distribution emphasized the dynamic focus shifts enabled through context-aware enhancements. The findings suggest that CASRM offers a scalable and flexible solution for integrating contextual intelligence into existing language model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Blades, Frederick Somerfield, William Langley, Susan Everingham, Maurice Witherington</p>
<p>Abstract: Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Modarressi, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui, Ryan A. Rossi, Seunghyun Yoon, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information. We publicly release the dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/adobe-research/NoLiMa.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patricia Porretta, Sylvester Pakenham, Huxley Ainsworth, Gregory Chatten, Godfrey Allerton, Simon Hollingsworth, Vance Periwinkle</p>
<p>Abstract: Token prediction stability remains a challenge in autoregressive generative models, where minor variations in early inference steps often lead to significant semantic drift over extended sequences. A structured modulation mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alistair Wren, Beatrice Loxley, Hamish Cadwallader, Simon Beckwith, Fabian Pargeter, James Blades</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal representations within deep neural architectures encode high-dimensional abstractions of linguistic structures, yet they often exhibit inefficiencies in feature distribution, limiting expressiveness and adaptability. Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection introduces a structured refinement technique that selectively reconfigures token embeddings through controlled subspace constraints, ensuring more stable and geometrically well-defined feature distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization. Perplexity evaluations confirmed that the adjustments did not negatively impact sequence coherence, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koinis Vassilis, Godfrey Milbourne, Harriet Featherstone, Xanthe Peverell, Yorick Bletchley, Zachary Montford</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextual adaptation in token embeddings plays a central role in determining how well language models maintain coherence and retain semantic relationships over extended text sequences. Static embeddings often impose constraints on lexical flexibility, leading to suboptimal performance when faced with complex sentence structures or domain-specific terminology shifts. To address this limitation, a structured approach was developed for dynamically reconfiguring token embeddings through continuous geometric transformations, ensuring that representations evolved in response to evolving discourse structures. A manifold-based transformation mechanism was integrated to regulate lexical positioning, allowing embeddings to undergo controlled shifts while preserving linguistic relationships across varying textual contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that embedding reconfiguration contributed to reductions in perplexity, improved lexical coherence, and enhanced sentence-level continuity, particularly in structured and domain-adaptive text generation tasks. Comparative analyses of embedding drift indicated that dynamically restructured representations maintained stronger contextual consistency, reducing misalignment in token dependencies while preserving fluency in language modeling outputs. Computational overhead assessments confirmed that while training complexity increased due to the iterative refinement of embeddings, inference remained efficient, ensuring practical feasibility for real-time generation. Evaluations across multiple datasets further demonstrated that dynamically modulated embeddings exhibited broader lexical diversity, reducing repetitive token patterns and enabling a more adaptable representation learning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Clive Pendleton, Ewan Harrington, Giles Fairbrother, Jasper Arkwright, Nigel Fenwick, Richard Katrix</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical vector field interpolation introduces a structured probabilistic framework for lexical representation, ensuring that word embeddings transition smoothly across a continuous manifold rather than being constrained to discrete token mappings. The proposed methodology constructs a probabilistic function space where word representations adhere to topological consistency, mitigating representational discontinuities commonly observed in transformer-based embeddings. Empirical evaluations reveal that probabilistic constraints enhance lexical coherence by refining contextual relationships, leading to improvements in semantic stability across multiple linguistic distributions. The application of divergence minimization techniques ensures that interpolated embeddings maintain probabilistic consistency while preserving computational feasibility for large-scale implementations. Experimental findings demonstrate that interpolated lexical manifolds improve representation density alignment, reducing anisotropic distortions in contextual embedding distributions. Comparative analyses with standard transformer-based models highlight that structured interpolation yields more stable representations, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic differentiation. The statistical evaluation of embedding divergence confirms that probabilistic lexical manifolds reduce representational inconsistencies while maintaining coherence across varying scales of contextual abstraction. An assessment of computational efficiency reveals that while interpolation introduces minor processing overhead, the structured representation learning approach remains scalable for practical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongye Jin, Pei Chen, Jingfeng Yang, Zhengyang Wang, Meng Jiang, Yifan Gao, Binxuan Huang, Xinyang Zhang, Zheng Li, Tianyi Liu, Huasheng Li, Bing Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, they are often distracted by irrelevant or noisy context in input sequences that degrades output quality. This problem affects both long- and short-context scenarios, such as retrieval-augmented generation, table question-answering, and in-context learning. We reveal that LLMs can implicitly identify whether input sequences contain useful information at early layers, prior to token generation. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Early Noise Dropping (\textsc{END}), a novel approach to mitigate this issue without requiring fine-tuning the LLMs. \textsc{END} segments input sequences into chunks and employs a linear prober on the early layers of LLMs to differentiate between informative and noisy chunks. By discarding noisy chunks early in the process, \textsc{END} preserves critical information, reduces distraction, and lowers computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{END} significantly improves both performance and efficiency across different LLMs on multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, by investigating LLMs' implicit understanding to the input with the prober, this work also deepens understanding of how LLMs do reasoning with contexts internally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatsuya Ishizaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of vowel tenseness has traditionally been examined through the binary distinction of tense and lax vowels. However, no universally accepted quantitative definition of tenseness has been established in any language. Previous studies, including those by Jakobson, Fant, and Halle (1951) and Chomsky and Halle (1968), have explored the relationship between vowel tenseness and the vocal tract. Building on these foundations, Ishizaki (2019, 2022) proposed an indirect quantification of vowel tenseness using formant angles {\theta}1 and {\theta}F1 and their first and second derivatives, dZ1(t)/dt = lim tan {\theta}1(t) and d2Z1(t)/dt2 = d/dt lim tan {\theta}1(t). This study extends this approach by investigating the potential role of a force-related parameter in determining vowel quality. Specifically, we introduce a simplified model based on the Lagrangian equation to describe the dynamic interaction of the tongue and jaw within the oral cavity during the articulation of close vowels. This model provides a theoretical framework for estimating the forces involved in vowel production across different languages, offering new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying vowel articulation. The findings suggest that this force-based perspective warrants further exploration as a key factor in phonetic and phonological studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models are strong few-shot learners and achieve good overall accuracy in text classification tasks, masking the fact that their results suffer from great class accuracy imbalance. We believe that the pursuit of overall accuracy should not come from enriching the strong classes, but from raising up the weak ones. To address the imbalance, we propose a Heaviside step function based ensemble debiasing method, which enables flexible rectifications of in-context learned class probabilities at both class and sample levels. Evaluations with Llama-2-13B on seven text classification benchmarks show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy gains with balanced class accuracies. More importantly, we perform analyses on the resulted probability correction scheme, showing that sample-level corrections are necessary to elevate weak classes. Due to effectively correcting weak classes, our method also brings significant performance gains to a larger model variant, Llama-2-70B, especially on a biomedical domain task, further demonstrating the necessity of ensemble debiasing at both levels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Document Key Information Extraction (KIE) is a technology that transforms valuable information in document images into structured data, and it has become an essential function in industrial settings. However, current evaluation metrics of this technology do not accurately reflect the critical attributes of its industrial applications. In this paper, we present KIEval, a novel application-centric evaluation metric for Document KIE models. Unlike prior metrics, KIEval assesses Document KIE models not just on the extraction of individual information (entity) but also of the structured information (grouping). Evaluation of structured information provides assessment of Document KIE models that are more reflective of extracting grouped information from documents in industrial settings. Designed with industrial application in mind, we believe that KIEval can become a standard evaluation metric for developing or applying Document KIE models in practice.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenglu Hong, Ravi Raju, Jonathan Lingjie Li, Bo Li, Urmish Thakker, Avinash Ravichandran, Swayambhoo Jain, Changran Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective method for accelerating inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a small draft model to predict the output of a target model. However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, aligning them with human preferences remains an open challenge. Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dewei Wang, Wei Zhu, Liyang Ling, Ettore Tiotto, Quintin Wang, Whitney Tsang, Julian Opperman, Jacky Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of LLMs, dense operations such as GEMM and MHA are critical components. These operations are well-suited for parallel execution using a tilebased approach. While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level interfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more user-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level. The current Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly lowers to per-thread level. And then attempt to coalesce and amend through a series of passes, promoting information from low-level representation. We believe this is pre-mature lowering based on the below observations. 1. GPU has a hierarchical structure both physically and logically. Modern GPUs often feature SIMD units capable of directly operating on tiles on a warp or warpgroup basis, such as blocked load and blocked MMA. 2. Multi-level gradual lowering can make compiler decoupled and clean by separating considerations inter and intra a logical layer. 3. Kernel developers often need fine control to get good performance on the latest hardware. FlashAttention2 advocates explicit data partition between warps to make a performance boost. In this context, we propose ML-Triton which features multi-level compilation flow and programming interface. Our approach begins at the workgroup level and progressively lowers to the warp and intrinsic level, implementing a multilevel lowering align with the hierarchical nature of GPU. Additionally, we extend triton language to support user-set compiler hint and warp level programming, enabling researchers to get good out-of-the box performance without awaiting compiler updates. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance above 95% of expert-written kernels on Intel GPU, as measured by the geometric mean.</p>

Despite considerable similarities between emotional reappraisal and cognitive reframing as emotion regulation techniques, these concepts have largely been examined in isolation. This research explores the relationship between cognitive distortions and emotional appraisal dimensions, examining their potential connections and relevance for future interdisciplinary studies. Under this pretext, we conduct an exploratory computational study, aimed at investigating the relationship between cognitive distortion and emotional appraisals. We show that the patterns of statistically significant relationships between cognitive distortions and appraisal dimensions vary across different distortion categories, giving rise to distinct appraisal profiles for individual distortion classes. Additionally, we analyze the impact of cognitive restructuring on appraisal dimensions, exemplifying the emotion regulation aspect of cognitive restructuring.</p>

Moreover, we reveal that PAD complements traditional data construction methods and enhances their effectiveness when combined.

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models have gained attention, many service developers still rely on embedding-based models due to practical constraints. In such cases, the quality of fine-tuning data directly impacts performance, and English datasets are often used as seed data for training non-English models. In this study, we propose LANGALIGN, which enhances target language processing by aligning English embedding vectors with those of the target language at the interface between the language model and the task header. Experiments on Korean, Japanese, and Chinese demonstrate that LANGALIGN significantly improves performance across all three languages. Additionally, we show that LANGALIGN can be applied in reverse to convert target language data into a format that an English-based model can process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, largely driven by high-quality web data used in pre-training. However, recent studies indicate this data source is rapidly depleting. Synthetic data emerges as a promising alternative, but it remains unclear whether synthetic datasets exhibit predictable scalability comparable to raw pre-training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by introducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora into diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by automatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple documents using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical experiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that reliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2) Performance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models approach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B model peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons with existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate that SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability. Our findings highlight synthetic data as a scalable and reliable alternative to organic pre-training corpora, offering a viable path toward continued improvement in model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangde Wang, Weidong Qiu, Peng Tang, Hao Tian, Shujun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Much research has been done on user-generated textual passwords. Surprisingly, semantic information in such passwords remain under-investigated, with passwords created by English- and/or Chinese-speaking users being more studied with limited semantics. This paper fills this gap by proposing a general framework based on semantically enhanced PCFG (probabilistic context-free grammars) named SE#PCFG. It allowed us to consider 43 types of semantic information, the richest set considered so far, for password analysis. Applying SE#PCFG to 17 large leaked password databases of user speaking four languages (English, Chinese, German and French), we demonstrate its usefulness and report a wide range of new insights about password semantics at different levels such as cross-website password correlations. Furthermore, based on SE#PCFG and a new systematic smoothing method, we proposed the Semantically Enhanced Password Cracking Architecture (SEPCA), and compared its performance against three SOTA (state-of-the-art) benchmarks in terms of the password coverage rate: two other PCFG variants and neural network. Our experimental results showed that SEPCA outperformed all the three benchmarks consistently and significantly across 52 test cases, by up to 21.53%, 52.55% and 7.86%, respectively, at the user-level (with duplicate passwords). At the level of unique passwords, SEPCA also beats the three counterparts by up to 43.83%, 94.11% and 11.16%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Bai, Ishika Singh, David Traum, Jesse Thomason</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible. However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, such as concurrent actions between two agents when there are no conflicting conditions, without significant modification and definition to existing PDDL domains. A human expert aware of such constraints can decompose a goal into subgoals, each reachable through single agent planning, to take advantage of simultaneous actions. In contrast to classical planning, large language models (LLMs) directly used for inferring plan steps rarely guarantee execution success, but are capable of leveraging commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. We combine the strengths of both classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for multi-agent planning goal decomposition. We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone, as well as most multiagent plans, while guaranteeing execution success. Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals result in similar multi-agent execution lengths to those specified by human experts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyeon Shin, Sujin jeon, Junghyun Kim, Gi-Cheon Kang, Byoung-Tak Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is the task of executing natural language instructions by navigating and interacting with objects in interactive environments. A key challenge in EIF is compositional task planning, typically addressed through supervised learning or few-shot in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, a self-QA-based zero-shot planning method that infers an appropriate plan without any further training. The Socratic Planner first facilitates self-questioning and answering by the Large Language Model (LLM), which in turn helps generate a sequence of subgoals. While executing the subgoals, an embodied agent may encounter unexpected situations, such as unforeseen obstacles. The Socratic Planner then adjusts plans based on dense visual feedback through a visually-grounded re-planning mechanism. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, outperforming current state-of-the-art planning models on the ALFRED benchmark across all metrics, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks that demand complex inference. We further demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on a physical robot for long-horizon tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingwei Ma, Qingping Yang, Rongyu Cao, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Alibaba LingmaAgent, a novel Automated Software Engineering method designed to comprehensively understand and utilize whole software repositories for issue resolution. Deployed in TONGYI Lingma, an IDE-based coding assistant developed by Alibaba Cloud, LingmaAgent addresses the limitations of existing LLM-based agents that primarily focus on local code information. Our approach introduces a top-down method to condense critical repository information into a knowledge graph, reducing complexity, and employs a Monte Carlo tree search based strategy enabling agents to explore and understand entire repositories. We guide agents to summarize, analyze, and plan using repository-level knowledge, allowing them to dynamically acquire information and generate patches for real-world GitHub issues. In extensive experiments, LingmaAgent demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an 18.5\% relative improvement on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark compared to SWE-agent. In production deployment and evaluation at Alibaba Cloud, LingmaAgent automatically resolved 16.9\% of in-house issues faced by development engineers, and solved 43.3\% of problems after manual intervention. Additionally, we have open-sourced a Python prototype of LingmaAgent for reference by other industrial developers https://github.com/RepoUnderstander/RepoUnderstander. In fact, LingmaAgent has been used as a developed reference by many subsequently agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gentiana Rashiti, Geethan Karunaratne, Mrinmaya Sachan, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system such as Retro has been shown to improve language modeling capabilities and reduce toxicity and hallucinations by retrieving from a database of non-parametric memory containing trillions of entries. We introduce Retro-li that shows retrieval can also help using a small-scale database, but it demands more accurate and better neighbors when searching in a smaller hence sparser non-parametric memory. This can be met by using a proper semantic similarity search. We further propose adding a regularization to the non-parametric memory for the first time: it significantly reduces perplexity when the neighbor search operations are noisy during inference, and it improves generalization when a domain shift occurs. We also show that Retro-li's non-parametric memory can potentially be implemented on analog in-memory computing hardware, exhibiting O(1) search time while causing noise in retrieving neighbors, with minimal (<1%) performance loss.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have been driven by extensive pretraining on large datasets followed by post-training. However, current post-training methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct alignment from preference methods (DAP) primarily utilize single-sample comparisons. These approaches often fail to capture critical characteristics such as generative diversity and bias, which are more accurately assessed through multiple samples. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that extends post-training to include multi-sample comparisons. To achieve this, we propose Multi-sample Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) and Multi-sample Identity Preference Optimization (mIPO). These methods improve traditional DAP methods by focusing on group-wise characteristics. Empirically, we demonstrate that multi-sample comparison is more effective in optimizing collective characteristics~(e.g., diversity and bias) for generative models than single-sample comparison. Additionally, our findings suggest that multi-sample comparisons provide a more robust optimization framework, particularly for dataset with label noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Huang, Yunfei Long, Cunjin Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success by leveraging label information; however, determining positive samples in multi-label scenarios remains a critical challenge. In multi-label supervised contrastive learning (MSCL), relations among multi-label samples are not yet fully defined, leading to ambiguity in identifying positive samples and formulating contrastive loss functions to construct the representation space. To address these challenges, we: (i) first define five distinct multi-label relations in MSCL to systematically identify positive samples, (ii) introduce a novel Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss that dynamically re-weights samples through computing the similarity and dissimilarity factors between positive samples and given anchors based on multi-label relations, and (iii) further provide theoretical grounded proof for our method through rigorous mathematical analysis that supports the formulation and effectiveness of the proposed loss function. We conduct the experiments across both image and text modalities, and extend the evaluation to medical domain. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in a comprehensive evaluation, confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Siyan, Vethavikashini Chithrra Raghuram, Omar Khattab, Julia Hirschberg, Zhou Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Users can divulge sensitive information to proprietary LLM providers, raising significant privacy concerns. While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code is available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Hee Song, Valts Blukis, Jonathan Tremblay, Stephen Tyree, Yu Su, Stan Birchfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robot manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of the contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/cosmos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, Sajib Acharjee Dip, Khizar Hussain, Lang Zhang, Chris Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and describing visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision-language tasks. However, these models often generate descriptions containing objects or details that are absent in the input image, a phenomenon commonly known as hallucination. Our work investigates the key reasons behind this issue by analyzing the pattern of self-attention in transformer layers. We find that hallucinations often arise from the progressive weakening of attention weight to visual tokens in the deeper layers of the LLM. Some previous works naively boost the attention of all visual tokens to mitigate this issue, resulting in suboptimal hallucination reduction. To address this, we identify two critical sets of visual tokens that facilitate the transfer of visual information from the vision encoder to the LLM. Local tokens encode grounded information about objects present in an image, while summary tokens capture the overall aggregated representation of the image. Importantly, these two sets of tokens require different levels of weight enhancement. To this end, we propose \textbf{PAINT} (\textbf{P}aying \textbf{A}ttention to \textbf{IN}formed \textbf{T}okens), a plug-and-play framework that intervenes in the self-attention mechanism of the LLM, selectively boosting the attention weights of local and summary tokens with experimentally learned margins. Evaluation on the MSCOCO image captioning dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baseline models while maintaining accuracy.

<p>Abstract: Long-form writing agents require flexible integration and interaction across information retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Current approaches rely on predetermined workflows and rigid thinking patterns to generate outlines before writing, resulting in constrained adaptability during writing. In this paper we propose a general agent framework that achieves human-like adaptive writing through recursive task decomposition and dynamic integration of three fundamental task types, i.e. retrieval, reasoning, and composition. Our methodology features: 1) a planning mechanism that interleaves recursive task decomposition and execution, eliminating artificial restrictions on writing workflow; and 2) integration of task types that facilitates heterogeneous task decomposition. Evaluations on both fiction writing and technical report generation show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all automatic evaluation metrics, which demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Junyan Wang, Victor Xiaoqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent application system designed to enhance office collaboration efficiency and work quality. The system integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing technologies, achieving functionalities such as task allocation, progress monitoring, and information sharing. The agents within the system are capable of providing personalized collaboration support based on team members' needs and incorporate data analysis tools to improve decision-making quality. The paper also proposes an intelligent agent architecture that separates Plan and Solver, and through techniques such as multi-turn query rewriting and business tool retrieval, it enhances the agent's multi-intent and multi-turn dialogue capabilities. Furthermore, the paper details the design of tools and multi-turn dialogue in the context of office collaboration scenarios, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments and evaluations. Ultimately, the system has demonstrated outstanding performance in real business applications, particularly in query understanding, task planning, and tool calling. Looking forward, the system is expected to play a more significant role in addressing complex interaction issues within dynamic environments and large-scale multi-agent systems.</p>
