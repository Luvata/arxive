<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan D. Pinto, Luc Paquette</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing use of complex machine learning models in education has led to concerns about their interpretability, which in turn has spurred interest in developing explainability techniques that are both faithful to the model's inner workings and intelligible to human end-users. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to creating a neural-network-based behavior detection model that is interpretable by design. Our model is fully interpretable, meaning that the parameters we extract for our explanations have a clear interpretation, fully capture the model's learned knowledge about the learner behavior of interest, and can be used to create explanations that are both faithful and intelligible. We achieve this by implementing a series of constraints to the model that both simplify its inference process and bring it closer to a human conception of the task at hand. We train the model to detect gaming-the-system behavior, evaluate its performance on this task, and compare its learned patterns to those identified by human experts. Our results show that the model is successfully able to learn patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior while providing evidence for fully interpretable explanations. We discuss the implications of our approach and suggest ways to evaluate explainability using a human-grounded approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Altun Shukurlu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) models student learning behavior by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict future performance based on historical interaction data. However, the original implementation relied on standard RNNs in the Lua-based Torch framework, which limited extensibility and reproducibility. In this work, we revisit the DKT model from two perspectives: architectural improvements and optimization efficiency. First, we enhance the model using gated recurrent units, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which better capture long-term dependencies and help mitigate vanishing gradient issues. Second, we re-implement DKT using the PyTorch framework, enabling a modular and accessible infrastructure compatible with modern deep learning workflows. We also benchmark several optimization algorithms SGD, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, and AdamW to evaluate their impact on convergence speed and predictive accuracy in educational modeling tasks. Experiments on the Synthetic-5 and Khan Academy datasets show that GRUs and LSTMs achieve higher accuracy and improved training stability compared to basic RNNs, while adaptive optimizers such as Adam and AdamW consistently outperform SGD in both early-stage learning and final model performance. Our open-source PyTorch implementation provides a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research in neural knowledge tracing and personalized learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents presents unique challenges including long-horizon decision making and interacting with stochastic environment feedback. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on three stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and decoupled clipping. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kalyan Cherukuri, Aarav Lala</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often constrained by their large memories and computational restrictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) that dynamically chooses the rank increase of the fully connected layers below a certain threshold in energy expenditure. Unlike conventional SVD compression methods that apply a fixed rank reduction in all layers, our ARSVD method uses energy distribution to adaptively select rank per layer while retaining accuracy. This is done for each layer in an effort to use as much energy as possible while maintaining the lowest accuracy loss. Such accuracy-adaptive approaches outperform traditional static rank reduction methods by providing an improved balance between compression and model performance. We first train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 dataset and evaluate its performance using accuracy and F1-score. After applying ARSVD, our results demonstrate that the technique can achieve substantial model compression without compromising classification accuracy. These results illustrate the usefulness of ARSVD in computing scenarios where both computational and memory resources are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Rao, Bo Zhao, Derong Liu, Cesare Alippi</p>
<p>Abstract: Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20080">DNAD: Differentiable Neural Architecture Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Rao, Bo Zhao, Derong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate trade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and computational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation (DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and search by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where cells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network progressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike conventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with simple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure, SNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible structures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure to a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of an over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD algorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences between the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level DARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both SNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar or lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD achieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20096">Towards Practical Second-Order Optimizers in Deep Learning: Insights from Fisher Information Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien Martins Gomes</p>
<p>Abstract: First-order optimization methods remain the standard for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, ex- hibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed. The code is available from https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AdaFisher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inmaculada Santamaria-Valenzuela, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, Javier Huertas-Tato, Jong Hyuk Park, David Camacho</p>
<p>Abstract: The present study explores the interpretability of latent spaces produced by time series foundation models, focusing on their potential for visual analysis tasks. Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingzhi Yu, Shuai Yan, Wenfeng Dai, Xiang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental for deciphering cellular functions,disease pathways,and drug discovery.Although existing neural networks and machine learning methods have achieved high accuracy in PPI prediction,their black-box nature leads to a lack of causal interpretation of the prediction results and difficulty in capturing hierarchical geometries and multi-scale dynamic interaction patterns among proteins.To address these challenges, we propose HyboWaveNet,a novel deep learning framework that collaborates with hyperbolic graphical neural networks (HGNNs) and multiscale graphical wavelet transform for robust PPI prediction. Mapping protein features to Lorentz space simulates hierarchical topological relationships among biomolecules via a hyperbolic distance metric,enabling node feature representations that better fit biological a priori.HyboWaveNet inherently simulates hierarchical and scale-free biological relationships, while the integration of wavelet transforms enables adaptive extraction of local and global interaction features across different resolutions. Our framework generates node feature representations via a graph neural network under the Lorenz model and generates pairs of positive samples under multiple different views for comparative learning, followed by further feature extraction via multi-scale graph wavelet transforms to predict potential PPIs. Experiments on public datasets show that HyboWaveNet improves over both existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate through ablation experimental studies that the multi-scale graph wavelet transform module improves the predictive performance and generalization ability of HyboWaveNet. This work links geometric deep learning and signal processing to advance PPI prediction, providing a principled approach for analyzing complex biological systems</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20106">Adaptive Helpfulness-Harmlessness Alignment with Preference Vectors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ren-Wei Liang, Chin-Ting Hsu, Chan-Hung Yu, Saransh Agrawal, Shih-Cheng Huang, Shang-Tse Chen, Kuan-Hao Huang, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless is a critical challenge, as overly strict constraints can lead to excessive refusals, while permissive models risk generating harmful content. Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), attempt to balance these trade-offs but suffer from performance conflicts, limited controllability, and poor extendability. To address these issues, we propose Preference Vector, a novel framework inspired by task arithmetic. Instead of optimizing multiple preferences within a single objective, we train separate models on individual preferences, extract behavior shifts as preference vectors, and dynamically merge them at test time. This modular approach enables fine-grained, user-controllable preference adjustments and facilitates seamless integration of new preferences without retraining. Experiments show that our proposed Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, allows smooth control over preference trade-offs, and supports scalable multi-preference alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Ekaputra Limantoro, Jhe-Hao Lin, Chih-Yu Wang, Yi-Lung Tsai, Hong-Han Shuai, Ching-Chun Huang, Wen-Huang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses the network capacity by transferring knowledge from a large (teacher) network to a smaller one (student). It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-hsuan Chen, Jing Bi, Cyril Ngo Ngoc, Victor Oancea, Jonathan Cagan, Levent Burak Kara</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-driven surrogate modeling has become an increasingly effective alternative to physics-based simulations for 3D design, analysis, and manufacturing. These models leverage data-driven methods to predict physical quantities traditionally requiring computationally expensive simulations. However, the scarcity of labeled CAD-to-simulation datasets has driven recent advancements in self-supervised and foundation models, where geometric representation learning is performed offline and later fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. While these approaches have shown promise, their effectiveness is limited in applications requiring fine-scale geometric detail preservation. This work introduces a self-supervised geometric representation learning method designed to capture fine-scale geometric features from non-parametric 3D models. Unlike traditional end-to-end surrogate models, this approach decouples geometric feature extraction from downstream physics tasks, learning a latent space embedding guided by geometric reconstruction losses. Key elements include the essential use of near-zero level sampling and the innovative batch-adaptive attention-weighted loss function, which enhance the encoding of intricate design features. The proposed method is validated through case studies in structural mechanics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing design features and enabling accurate few-shot physics predictions. Comparisons with traditional parametric surrogate modeling highlight its potential to bridge the gap between geometric and physics-based representations, providing an effective solution for surrogate modeling in data-scarce scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chowdhury Mohammad Abid Rahman, Aldo H. Romero, Prashnna K. Gyawali</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Kazemi, Helia Rezvani, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferability scores aim to quantify how well a model trained on one domain generalizes to a target domain. Despite numerous methods proposed for measuring transferability, their reliability and practical usefulness remain inconclusive, often due to differing experimental setups, datasets, and assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate transferability scores across diverse settings. Through extensive experiments, we observe variations in how different metrics perform under various scenarios, suggesting that current evaluation practices may not fully capture each method's strengths and limitations. Our findings underscore the value of standardized assessment protocols, paving the way for more reliable transferability measures and better-informed model selection in cross-domain applications. Additionally, we achieved a 3.5\% improvement using our proposed metric for the head-training fine-tuning experimental setup.

<p>Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Jahn, Karthik Karnik, Leonard J. Schulman</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the Causal Identification algorithm to causal time series graphs with latent confounders. Since these graphs extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Sun, Heeseung Bang, Andreas A. Malikopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an adherence-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach aimed at seeking optimal lane-changing recommendations within a semi-autonomous driving environment to enhance a single vehicle's travel efficiency. The problem is framed within a Markov decision process setting and is addressed through an adherence-aware deep Q network, which takes into account the partial compliance of human drivers with the recommended actions. This approach is evaluated within CARLA's driving environment under realistic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Cui, Shuxian Zhang, Kangzhi Lou, Le-Nam Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents ProFi-Net, a novel few-shot learning framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition that overcomes the chal- lenges of limited training data and sparse feature representations. ProFi- Net employs a prototype-based metric learning architecture enhanced with a feature-level attention mechanism, which dynamically refines the Euclidean distance by emphasizing the most discriminative feature di- mensions. Additionally, our approach introduces a curriculum-inspired data augmentation strategy exclusively on the query set. By progressively incorporating Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude, the model is ex- posed to a broader range of challenging variations, thereby improving its generalization and robustness to overfitting. Extensive experiments con- ducted across diverse real-world environments demonstrate that ProFi- Net significantly outperforms conventional prototype networks and other state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods in terms of classification ac- curacy and training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryeh Brill</p>
<p>Abstract: Decomposing a deep neural network's learned representations into interpretable features could greatly enhance its safety and reliability. To better understand features, we adopt a geometric perspective, viewing them as a learned coordinate system for mapping an embedded data distribution. We motivate a model of a generic data distribution as a random lattice and analyze its properties using percolation theory. Learned features are categorized into context, component, and surface features. The model is qualitatively consistent with recent findings in mechanistic interpretability and suggests directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Xia, Akanksha Atrey, Fadoua Khmaissia, Kedar S. Namjoshi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). For a precisely defined yet tractable formulation, we choose the conceptually simple but technically complex task of constructing proofs in Boolean logic. A trained LLM receives as input a set of assumptions and a goal, and produces as output a proof that formally derives the goal from the assumptions. Incorrect proofs are caught by an automated proof checker. A critical obstacle for training is the scarcity of real-world proofs. We propose an efficient, randomized procedure for synthesizing valid proofs and introduce Template Transformation, a data augmentation technique that enhances the model's ability to handle complex logical expressions. The central evaluation question is whether an LLM has indeed learned to reason. We propose tests to measure the reasoning ability of a black-box LLM. By these measures, experiments demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for assertions with short proofs, which decline with proof complexity. Notably, template transformation improves accuracy even for smaller models, suggesting its effectiveness across model scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> W. Diab, M. Al-Kobaisi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) are machine learning models designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning to map between function spaces. Neural Operators such as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated excellent generalization properties when mapping between spatial function spaces. However, they struggle in mapping the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs, especially for time steps not explicitly seen during training. This limits their temporal accuracy as they do not leverage these dynamics in the training process. In addition, most NOs tend to be prohibitively costly to train, especially for higher-dimensional PDEs. In this paper, we propose the Temporal Neural Operator (TNO), an efficient neural operator specifically designed for spatio-temporal operator learning for time-dependent PDEs. TNO achieves this by introducing a temporal-branch to the DeepONet framework, leveraging the best architectural design choices from several other NOs, and a combination of training strategies including Markov assumption, teacher forcing, temporal bundling, and the flexibility to condition the output on the current state or past states. Through extensive benchmarking and an ablation study on a diverse set of example problems we demonstrate the TNO long range temporal extrapolation capabilities, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and flexibility to handle multiple input functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Yang, Nikhil Krishnan, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20271">Investigating task-specific prompts and sparse autoencoders for activation monitoring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Henk Tillman, Dan Mossing</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models can behave in unexpected and unsafe ways, and so it is valuable to monitor their outputs. Internal activations of language models encode additional information that could be useful for this. The baseline approach for activation monitoring is some variation of linear probing on a particular layer: starting from a labeled dataset, train a logistic regression classifier on that layer's activations. Recent work has proposed several approaches which may improve on naive linear probing, by leveraging additional computation. One class of techniques, which we call "prompted probing," leverages test time computation to improve monitoring by (1) prompting the model with a description of the monitoring task, and (2) applying a learned linear probe to resulting activations. Another class of techniques uses computation at train time: training sparse autoencoders offline to identify an interpretable basis for the activations, and e.g. max-pooling activations across tokens using that basis before applying a linear probe. However, one can also prompt the model with a description of the monitoring task and use its output directly. We develop and test novel refinements of these methods and compare them against each other. We find asking the model zero-shot is a reasonable baseline when inference-time compute is not limited; however, activation probing methods can substantially outperform this baseline given sufficient training data. Specifically, we recommend prompted probing when inference-time compute is available, due to its superior data efficiency and good generalization performance. Alternatively, if inference-time compute is limited, we find SAE-based probing methods outperform raw activation probing.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control in multi-user interference networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael A. Helcig, Stefan Nastic</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed model training is crucial for modern machine learning applications, yet existing Federated Learning approaches struggle with heterogeneous data distributions and varying computational capabilities. Traditional solutions either treat all participants uniformly or require costly dynamic clustering during training, leading to reduced efficiency and delayed model specialization. We present FedCCL (Federated Clustered Continual Learning), a framework specifically designed for environments with static organizational characteristics but dynamic client availability. By combining static pre-training clustering with an adapted asynchronous FedAvg algorithm, FedCCL enables new clients to immediately profit from specialized models without prior exposure to their data distribution, while maintaining reduced coordination overhead and resilience to client disconnections. Our approach implements an asynchronous Federated Learning protocol with a three-tier model topology - global, cluster-specific, and local models - that efficiently manages knowledge sharing across heterogeneous participants. Evaluation using photovoltaic installations across central Europe demonstrates that FedCCL's location-based clustering achieves an energy prediction error of 3.93% (+-0.21%), while maintaining data privacy and showing that the framework maintains stability for population-independent deployments, with 0.14 percentage point degradation in performance for new installations. The results demonstrate that FedCCL offers an effective framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning, maintaining high accuracy and adaptability even with dynamic participant populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Kober</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional k-means clustering underperforms on non-convex shapes and requires the number of clusters k to be specified in advance. We propose a simple geometric enhancement: after standard k-means, each cluster center is assigned a radius (the distance to its farthest assigned point), and clusters whose radii overlap are merged. This post-processing step loosens the requirement for exact k: as long as k is overestimated (but not excessively), the method can often reconstruct non-convex shapes through meaningful merges. We also show that this approach supports recursive partitioning: clustering can be performed independently on tiled regions of the feature space, then globally merged, making the method scalable and suitable for distributed systems. Implemented as a lightweight post-processing step atop scikit-learn's k-means, the algorithm performs well on benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy with minimal additional computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadhossein Homaei, Victor Gonzalez Morales, Oscar Mogollon-Gutierrez, Andres Caro</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are improving water distribution systems by using real-time data, analytics, and prediction models to optimize operations. This paper presents a DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict water consumption. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). These attacks manipulate critical model parameters, injecting subtle distortions that degrade forecasting accuracy. To further exploit these vulnerabilities, we introduce a Learning Automata (LA) and Random LA-based approach that dynamically adjusts perturbations, making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. Experimental results show that this approach significantly impacts prediction reliability, causing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to rise from 26% to over 35%. Moreover, adaptive attack strategies amplify this effect, highlighting cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust defenses, including adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure data pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Chen, Xuhui Fan, Zhangkai Wu, Longbing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, consisting of two main components: a surrogate model and an acquisition function. In recent years, myopic acquisition functions have been widely adopted for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, their lack of look-ahead capability limits their performance. To address this limitation, we propose FigBO, a generalized acquisition function that incorporates the future impact of candidate points on global information gain. FigBO is a plug-and-play method that can integrate seamlessly with most existing myopic acquisition functions. Theoretically, we analyze the regret bound and convergence rate of FigBO when combined with the myopic base acquisition function expected improvement (EI), comparing them to those of standard EI. Empirically, extensive experimental results across diverse tasks demonstrate that FigBO achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly faster convergence compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Greg Gluch, Shafi Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a cryptographically inspired theoretical study of detection versus mitigation of adversarial inputs produced by attackers of Machine Learning algorithms during inference time.
  We formally define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation (DbM). Our definitions come in the form of a 3-round protocol between two resource-bounded parties: a trainer/defender and an attacker. The attacker aims to produce inference-time inputs that fool the training algorithm. We define correctness, completeness, and soundness properties to capture successful defense at inference time while not degrading (too much) the performance of the algorithm on inputs from the training distribution.
  We first show that achieving DbD and achieving DbM are equivalent for ML classification tasks. Surprisingly, this is not the case for ML generative learning tasks, where there are many possible correct outputs that can be generated for each input. We show a separation between DbD and DbM by exhibiting a generative learning task for which is possible to defend by mitigation but is provably impossible to defend by detection under the assumption that the Identity-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (IB-FHE), publicly-verifiable zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) and Strongly Unforgeable Signatures exist. The mitigation phase uses significantly fewer samples than the initial training algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN) training paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings. However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\% and 12.7\%, and saves at maximum 86\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huchen Yang, Xinghao Dong, Jin-Long Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) offers a principled framework for optimizing data acquisition by leveraging probabilistic inference. However, practical implementations of BED are often compromised by model discrepancy, i.e., the mismatch between predictive models and true physical systems, which can potentially lead to biased parameter estimates. While data-driven approaches have been recently explored to characterize the model discrepancy, the resulting high-dimensional parameter space poses severe challenges for both Bayesian updating and design optimization. In this work, we propose a hybrid BED framework enabled by auto-differentiable ensemble Kalman inversion (AD-EKI) that addresses these challenges by providing a computationally efficient, gradient-free alternative to estimate the information gain for high-dimensional network parameters. The AD-EKI allows a differentiable evaluation of the utility function in BED and thus facilitates the use of standard gradient-based methods for design optimization. In the proposed hybrid framework, we iteratively optimize experimental designs, decoupling the inference of low-dimensional physical parameters handled by standard BED methods, from the high-dimensional model discrepancy handled by AD-EKI. The identified optimal designs for the model discrepancy enable us to systematically collect informative data for its calibration. The performance of the proposed method is studied by a classical convection-diffusion BED example, and the hybrid framework enabled by AD-EKI efficiently identifies informative data to calibrate the model discrepancy and robustly infers the unknown physical parameters in the modeled system. Besides addressing the challenges of BED with model discrepancy, AD-EKI also potentially fosters efficient and scalable frameworks in many other areas with bilevel optimization, such as meta-learning and structure optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellis R. Crabtree, Dimitris G. Giovanis, Nikolaos Evangelou, Juan M. Bello-Rivas, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis</p>
<p>Abstract: In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit.
  In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.</p>

<p>Abstract: Manifold clustering, with its exceptional ability to capture complex data structures, holds a pivotal position in cluster analysis. However, existing methods often focus only on finding the optimal combination between K-means and manifold learning, and overlooking the consistency between the data structure and labels. To address this issue, we deeply explore the relationship between K-means and manifold learning, and on this basis, fuse them to develop a new clustering framework. Specifically, the algorithm uses labels to guide the manifold structure and perform clustering on it, which ensures the consistency between the data structure and labels. Furthermore, in order to naturally maintain the class balance in the clustering process, we maximize the Schatten p-norm of labels, and provide a theoretical proof to support this. Additionally, our clustering framework is designed to be flexible and compatible with many types of distance functions, which facilitates efficient processing of nonlinear separable data. The experimental results of several databases confirm the superiority of our proposed model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Boltzmann equation, a fundamental model in kinetic theory, describes the evolution of particle distribution functions through a nonlinear, high-dimensional collision operator. However, its numerical solution remains computationally demanding, particularly for inelastic collisions and high-dimensional velocity domains. In this work, we propose the Fourier Neural Spectral Network (FourierSpecNet), a hybrid framework that integrates the Fourier spectral method with deep learning to approximate the collision operator in Fourier space efficiently. FourierSpecNet achieves resolution-invariant learning and supports zero-shot super-resolution, enabling accurate predictions at unseen resolutions without retraining. Beyond empirical validation, we establish a consistency result showing that the trained operator converges to the spectral solution as the discretization is refined. We evaluate our method on several benchmark cases, including Maxwellian and hard-sphere molecular models, as well as inelastic collision scenarios. The results demonstrate that FourierSpecNet offers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional spectral solvers. Our approach provides a robust and scalable alternative for solving the Boltzmann equation across both elastic and inelastic regimes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using diffusion models with an asynchronous noise schedule. At each step of the diffusion process, the noise schedule injects noise of varying scales into different parts of the data. With a careful design of the noise schedules, earlier events are generated faster than later ones, thus providing stronger conditioning for forecasting the more distant future. We derive an objective to effectively train these models for a general family of noise schedules based on conditional flow matching. Our method models the joint distribution of the latent representations of events in a sequence and achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting both the next inter-event time and event type on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it flexibly accommodates varying lengths of observation and prediction windows in different forecasting settings by adjusting the starting and ending points of the generation process. Finally, our method shows superior performance in long-horizon prediction tasks, outperforming existing baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Homophily, as a measure, has been critical to increasing our understanding of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, to date this measure has only been analyzed in the context of static graphs. In our work, we explore homophily in dynamic settings. Focusing on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), we demonstrate theoretically that in dynamic settings, current GCN discriminative performance is characterized by the probability that a node's future label is the same as its neighbors' current labels. Based on this insight, we propose dynamic homophily, a new measure of homophily that applies in the dynamic setting. This new measure correlates with GNN discriminative performance and sheds light on how to potentially design more powerful GNNs for dynamic graphs. Leveraging a variety of dynamic node classification datasets, we demonstrate that popular GNNs are not robust to low dynamic homophily. Going forward, our work represents an important step towards understanding homophily and GNN performance in dynamic node classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that current graph positional encodings (PEs) are not beneficial and could potentially hurt performance in tasks involving heterophilous graphs, where nodes that are close tend to have different labels. This limitation is critical as many real-world networks exhibit heterophily, and even highly homophilous graphs can contain local regions of strong heterophily. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable Laplacian Positional Encodings (LLPE), a new PE that leverages the full spectrum of the graph Laplacian, enabling them to capture graph structure on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. Theoretically, we prove LLPE's ability to approximate a general class of graph distances and demonstrate its generalization properties. Empirically, our evaluation on 12 benchmarks demonstrates that LLPE improves accuracy across a variety of GNNs, including graph transformers, by up to 35% and 14% on synthetic and real-world graphs, respectively. Going forward, our work represents a significant step towards developing PEs that effectively capture complex structures in heterophilous graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation but face significant memory bottlenecks during training. GaLore, Gradient Low-Rank Projection, addresses this issue by leveraging the inherent low-rank structure of weight gradients, enabling substantial memory savings without sacrificing performance. Recent works further extend GaLore from various aspects, including low-bit quantization and higher-order tensor structures. However, there are several remaining challenges for GaLore, such as the computational overhead of SVD for subspace updates and the integration with state-of-the-art training parallelization strategies (e.g., FSDP). In this paper, we present GaLore 2, an efficient and scalable GaLore framework that addresses these challenges and incorporates recent advancements. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of GaLore 2 by pre-training Llama 7B from scratch using up to 500 billion training tokens, highlighting its potential impact on real LLM pre-training scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Wang, Pengfei Jia, Zhitao Shu, Keyan Liu, Abdul Rashid Mohamed Shariff</p>
<p>Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of weather indicators is of great significance in disaster prevention and mitigation, agricultural production, and transportation. Precipitation, as one of the key meteorological indicators, plays a crucial role in water resource management, agricultural production, and urban flood control. This study proposes a multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a CNN- LSTM hybrid framework, aiming to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts. The dataset is sourced from Pune, Maharashtra, India, covering monthly mean precipitation data from 1972 to 2002. This dataset includes nearly 31 years (1972-2002) of monthly average precipitation, reflecting the long-term fluctuations and seasonal variations of precipitation in the region. By analyzing these time series data, the CNN-LSTM model effectively captures local features and long-term dependencies. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752, which demonstrates a significant advantage over traditional time series prediction methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Furthermore, this study provides new research ideas for precipitation prediction. However, the model requires high computational resources when dealing with large-scale datasets, and its predictive ability for multidimensional precipitation data still needs improvement. Future research could extend the model to support and predict multidimensional precipitation data, thereby promoting the development of more accurate and efficient meteorological prediction technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Xiao, Wenhao Song, Miaojiang Chen, Ruikun Luo, Min Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent fault-tolerant (FT) computing has recently demonstrated significant advantages of predicting and diagnosing faults in advance, enabling reliable service delivery. However, due to heterogeneity of fault knowledge and complex dependence relationships of time series log data, existing deep learning-based FT algorithms further improve detection performance relying on single neural network model with difficulty. To this end, we propose FT-MoE, a sustainable-learning mixture-of-experts model for fault-tolerant computing with multiple tasks, which enables different parameters learning distinct fault knowledge to achieve high-reliability for service system. Firstly, we use decoder-based transformer models to obtain fault prototype vectors of decoupling long-distance dependencies. Followed by, we present a dual mixture of experts networks for high-accurate prediction for both fault detection and classification tasks. Then, we design a two-stage optimization scheme of offline training and online tuning, which allows that in operation FT-MoE can also keep learning to adapt to dynamic service environments. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of FT-MoE, we conduct extensive experiments on the FT benchmark. Experimental results show that FT-MoE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabe Guo, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: In arbitrary-order language models, it is an open question how to sample tokens in parallel from the correct joint distribution. With discrete diffusion models, the more tokens they generate in parallel, the less their predicted distributions adhere to the originally learned data distribution, as they rely on a conditional independence assumption that only works with infinitesimally small timesteps. We find that a different class of models, any-subset autoregressive models (AS-ARMs), holds the solution. As implied by the name, AS-ARMs can generate tokens in any order, and in parallel. Moreover, AS-ARMs support parallelized joint probability density estimation, allowing them to correct their own parallel-generated token distributions, via our Any-Subset Speculative Decoding (ASSD) algorithm. ASSD provably enables generation of tokens from the correct joint distribution, with the number of neural network calls upper bounded by the number of tokens predicted. We empirically verify that ASSD speeds up language generation, without sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we provide a mathematically justified scheme for training AS-ARMs for generation, and show that AS-ARMs achieve state-of-the-art performance among sub-200M parameter models on infilling benchmark tasks, and nearly match the performance of models 50X larger on code generation. Our theoretical and empirical results indicate that the once-forgotten AS-ARMs are a promising direction of language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baining Chen, Yiming Zhang, Yuqiao Han, Ruyue Zhang, Ruihuan Du, Zhishuo Zhou, Zhengdan Zhu, Xun Liu, Jiecheng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal effect estimation has been widely used in marketing optimization. The framework of an uplift model followed by a constrained optimization algorithm is popular in practice. To enhance performance in the online environment, the framework needs to be improved to address the complexities caused by temporal dataset shift. This paper focuses on capturing the dataset shift from user behavior and domain distribution changing over time. We propose an Incremental Causal Effect with Proxy Knowledge Distillation (ICE-PKD) framework to tackle this challenge. The ICE-PKD framework includes two components: (i) a multi-treatment uplift network that eliminates confounding bias using counterfactual regression; (ii) an incremental training strategy that adapts to the temporal dataset shift by updating with the latest data and protects generalization via replay-based knowledge distillation. We also revisit the uplift modeling metrics and introduce a novel metric for more precise online evaluation in multiple treatment scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and online datasets show that the proposed framework achieves better performance. The ICE-PKD framework has been deployed in the marketing system of Huaxiaozhu, a ride-hailing platform in China.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Li, Changhua Zhou, Jia Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model by minimizing differences between their output distributions. However, existing distillation approaches largely focus on mimicking absolute probabilities and neglect the valuable relational inductive biases embedded in the teacher's relative predictions, leading to exposure bias. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Knowledge Distillation (GRKD), a novel framework that distills teacher knowledge by learning the relative ranking among classes, rather than directly fitting the absolute distribution. Specifically, we introduce a group relative loss that encourages the student model to preserve the pairwise preference orderings provided by the teacher's outputs. Extensive experiments on classification benchmarks demonstrate that GRKD achieves superior generalization compared to existing methods, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained class differentiation. Our method provides a new perspective on exploiting teacher knowledge, focusing on relational structure rather than absolute likelihood.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gissel Velarde, Tillman Weyde, David Meredith</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate a machine-learning method in which symbolic representations of folk songs are segmented and classified into tune families with Haar-wavelet filtering. The method is compared with previously proposed Gestalt-based method. Melodies are represented as discrete symbolic pitch-time signals. We apply the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the Haar wavelet at specific scales, obtaining filtered versions of melodies emphasizing their information at particular time-scales. We use the filtered signal for representation and segmentation, using the wavelet coefficients' local maxima to indicate local boundaries and classify segments by means of k-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics (Euclidean, cityblock), and compare the results to a Gestalt-based segmentation method and metrics applied directly to the pitch signal. We found that the wavelet based segmentation and wavelet-filtering of the pitch signal lead to better classification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation when the time-scale and other parameters are optimized.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Child, Lam Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: The DeeP-Mod framework builds an environment model using features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN), trained via a Deep Q-Network (DQN). While Deep Q-Learning is effective in decision-making, state information is lost in deeper DQN layers due to mixed state-action representations. We address this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to train a DDPN, where Value Iteration ensures the output represents state values, not state-action pairs. Extracting features from the DDPN preserves state information, enabling task and action set independence. We show that a reduced DDPN can be trained using features extracted from the original DDPN trained on an identical problem. This reduced DDPN achieves faster convergence under noise and outperforms the original DDPN. Finally, we introduce the DeeP-Mod framework, which creates an environment model using the evolution of features extracted from a DDPN in response to actions. A second DDPN, which learns directly from this feature model rather than raw states, can learn an effective feature-value representation and thus optimal policy. A key advantage of DeeP-Mod is that an externally defined environment model is not needed at any stage, making DDPN applicable to a wide range of environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shunjie Wen, Thomas Heinis, Dong-Wan Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danilo Avola, Federica Bruni, Gian Luca Foresti, Daniele Pannone, Amedeo Ranaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing uses radio-frequency signals from Wi-Fi devices to analyze environments, enabling tasks such as tracking people, detecting intrusions, and recognizing gestures. The rise of this technology is driven by the IEEE 802.11bf standard and growing demand for tools that can ensure privacy and operate through obstacles. However, the performance of Wi-Fi sensing is heavily influenced by environmental conditions, especially when extracting spatial and temporal features from the surrounding scene. A key challenge is achieving robust generalization across domains, ensuring stable performance even when the sensing environment changes significantly. This paper introduces a novel deep learning model for cross-domain adaptation of Wi-Fi signals, inspired by physical signal shielding. The model uses a Relativistic average Generative Adversarial Network (RaGAN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architectures for both the generator and discriminator. To simulate physical shielding, an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was constructed, mimicking a Faraday cage. Wi-Fi signal spectra were collected from various materials both inside (domain-free) and outside (domain-dependent) the box to train the model. A multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained on domain-free spectra and tested on signals denoised by the RaGAN. The system achieved 96% accuracy and demonstrated strong material discrimination capabilities, offering potential for use in security applications to identify concealed objects based on their composition.</p>

<p>Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20579">Representation Learning Preserving Ignorability and Covariate Matching for Treatment Effects</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Praharsh Nanavati, Ranjitha Prasad, Karthikeyan Shanmugam</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating treatment effects from observational data is challenging due to two main reasons: (a) hidden confounding, and (b) covariate mismatch (control and treatment groups not having identical distributions). Long lines of works exist that address only either of these issues. To address the former, conventional techniques that require detailed knowledge in the form of causal graphs have been proposed. For the latter, covariate matching and importance weighting methods have been used. Recently, there has been progress in combining testable independencies with partial side information for tackling hidden confounding. A common framework to address both hidden confounding and selection bias is missing. We propose neural architectures that aim to learn a representation of pre-treatment covariates that is a valid adjustment and also satisfies covariate matching constraints. We combine two different neural architectures: one based on gradient matching across domains created by subsampling a suitable anchor variable that assumes causal side information, followed by the other, a covariate matching transformation. We prove that approximately invariant representations yield approximate valid adjustment sets which would enable an interval around the true causal effect. In contrast to usual sensitivity analysis, where an unknown nuisance parameter is varied, we have a testable approximation yielding a bound on the effect estimate. We also outperform various baselines with respect to ATE and PEHE errors on causal benchmarks that include IHDP, Jobs, Cattaneo, and an image-based Crowd Management dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rilind Sahitaj, Paulius Sasnauskas, Yi\u{g}it Yal{\i}n, Debmalya Mandal, Goran Radanovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Performative Reinforcement Learning (PRL) refers to a scenario in which the deployed policy changes the reward and transition dynamics of the underlying environment. In this work, we study multi-agent PRL by incorporating performative effects into Markov Potential Games (MPGs). We introduce the notion of a performatively stable equilibrium (PSE) and show that it always exists under a reasonable sensitivity assumption. We then provide convergence results for state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve MPGs. Specifically, we show that independent policy gradient ascent (IPGA) and independent natural policy gradient (INPG) converge to an approximate PSE in the best-iterate sense, with an additional term that accounts for the performative effects. Furthermore, we show that INPG asymptotically converges to a PSE in the last-iterate sense. As the performative effects vanish, we recover the convergence rates from prior work. For a special case of our game, we provide finite-time last-iterate convergence results for a repeated retraining approach, in which agents independently optimize a surrogate objective. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley Segal, Joshua Fieggen, David Clifton, Lei Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the generalisability of clinical machine learning (ML) models across diverse healthcare settings remains a significant challenge due to variability in patient demographics, disease prevalence, and institutional practices. Existing model evaluation approaches often rely on real-world datasets, which are limited in availability, embed confounding biases, and lack the flexibility needed for systematic experimentation. Furthermore, while generative models aim for statistical realism, they often lack transparency and explicit control over factors driving distributional shifts. In this work, we propose a novel structured synthetic data framework designed for the controlled benchmarking of model robustness, fairness, and generalisability. Unlike approaches focused solely on mimicking observed data, our framework provides explicit control over the data generating process, including site-specific prevalence variations, hierarchical subgroup effects, and structured feature interactions. This enables targeted investigation into how models respond to specific distributional shifts and potential biases. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the framework's ability to isolate the impact of site variations, support fairness-aware audits, and reveal generalisation failures, particularly highlighting how model complexity interacts with site-specific effects. This work contributes a reproducible, interpretable, and configurable tool designed to advance the reliable deployment of ML in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon De Vos, Jente Van Belle, Andres Algaba, Wouter Verbeke, Sam Verboven</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven decision support tools play an increasingly central role in decision-making across various domains. In this work, we focus on binary classification models for predicting positive-outcome scores and deciding on resource allocation, e.g., credit scores for granting loans or churn propensity scores for targeting customers with a retention campaign. Such models may exhibit discriminatory behavior toward specific demographic groups through their predicted scores, potentially leading to unfair resource allocation. We focus on demographic parity as a fairness metric to compare the proportions of instances that are selected based on their positive outcome scores across groups. In this work, we propose a decision-centric fairness methodology that induces fairness only within the decision-making region -- the range of relevant decision thresholds on the score that may be used to decide on resource allocation -- as an alternative to a global fairness approach that seeks to enforce parity across the entire score distribution. By restricting the induction of fairness to the decision-making region, the proposed decision-centric approach avoids imposing overly restrictive constraints on the model, which may unnecessarily degrade the quality of the predicted scores. We empirically compare our approach to a global fairness approach on multiple (semi-synthetic) datasets to identify scenarios in which focusing on fairness where it truly matters, i.e., decision-centric fairness, proves beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqing Fan, Siyuan Du, Shengchao Hu, Pingjie Wang, Li Shen, Ya Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting high-quality pre-training data for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their overall performance under limited computation budget, improving both training and sample efficiency. Recent advancements in file selection primarily rely on using an existing or trained proxy model to assess the similarity of samples to a target domain, such as high quality sources BookCorpus and Wikipedia. However, upon revisiting these methods, the domain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma, i.e.dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the domain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance. To prevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection algorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature space. We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more uniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts, analyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of $\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a benchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with models from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the Harness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall performance. Specifically, DiSF saves 98.5% of 590M training files in SlimPajama, outperforming the full-data pre-training within a 50B training budget, and achieving about 1.5x training efficiency and 5x data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows multiple devices or institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data with a third-party. FL is considered a promising way to address patient privacy concerns in medical artificial intelligence. The ethical risks of medical FL systems themselves, however, have thus far been underexamined. This paper aims to address this gap. We argue that medical FL presents a new variety of opacity -- federation opacity -- that, in turn, generates a distinctive double black box problem in healthcare AI. We highlight several instances in which the anticipated benefits of medical FL may be exaggerated, and conclude by highlighting key challenges that must be overcome to make FL ethically feasible in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhonghao Li, Ji Shi, Xinming Zhang, Miao Zhang, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional message-passing graph neural networks in many studies, especially in processing graph data with long-range dependencies. However, GTs tend to suffer from weak inductive bias, overfitting and over-globalizing problems due to the dense attention. In this paper, we introduce SFi-attention, a novel attention mechanism designed to learn sparse pattern by minimizing an energy function based on network flows with l1-norm regularization, to relieve those issues caused by dense attention. Furthermore, SFi-Former is accordingly devised which can leverage the sparse attention pattern of SFi-attention to generate sparse network flows beyond adjacency matrix of graph data. Specifically, SFi-Former aggregates features selectively from other nodes through flexible adaptation of the sparse attention, leading to a more robust model. We validate our SFi-Former on various graph datasets, especially those graph data exhibiting long-range dependencies. Experimental results show that our SFi-Former obtains competitive performance on GNN Benchmark datasets and SOTA performance on LongRange Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets. Additionally, our model gives rise to smaller generalization gaps, which indicates that it is less prone to over-fitting. Click here for codes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Piaggesi, Riccardo Guidotti, Fosca Giannotti, Dino Pedreschi</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc explainability is essential for understanding black-box machine learning models. Surrogate-based techniques are widely used for local and global model-agnostic explanations but have significant limitations. Local surrogates capture non-linearities but are computationally expensive and sensitive to parameters, while global surrogates are more efficient but struggle with complex local behaviors. In this paper, we present ILLUME, a flexible and interpretable framework grounded in representation learning, that can be integrated with various surrogate models to provide explanations for any black-box classifier. Specifically, our approach combines a globally trained surrogate with instance-specific linear transformations learned with a meta-encoder to generate both local and global explanations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ILLUME in producing feature attributions and decision rules that are not only accurate but also robust and faithful to the black-box, thus providing a unified explanation framework that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional surrogate methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Kapar, Niklas Koenen, Martin Jullum</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating synthetic tabular data is challenging, since they can differ from the real data in so many ways. There exist numerous metrics of synthetic data quality, ranging from statistical distances to predictive performance, often providing conflicting results. Moreover, they fail to explain or pinpoint the specific weaknesses in the synthetic data. To address this, we apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques to a binary detection classifier trained to distinguish real from synthetic data. While the classifier identifies distributional differences, XAI concepts such as feature importance and feature effects, analyzed through methods like permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, Shapley values and counterfactual explanations, reveal why synthetic data are distinguishable, highlighting inconsistencies, unrealistic dependencies, or missing patterns. This interpretability increases transparency in synthetic data evaluation and provides deeper insights beyond conventional metrics, helping diagnose and improve synthetic data quality. We apply our approach to two tabular datasets and generative models, showing that it uncovers issues overlooked by standard evaluation techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that learn a neural network representation, i.e. regular patterns of normal data, which anomalies are deviating from. Inspired by a similar concept in engineering, we refer to our methodology as surrogate anomaly detection. We formalize the concept of surrogate anomaly detection into a set of axioms required for optimal surrogate models and propose a new algorithm, named DEAN (Deep Ensemble ANomaly detection), designed to fulfill these criteria. We evaluate DEAN on 121 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against 19 existing methods, as well as the scalability and reliability of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tariq Qayyum, Asadullah Tariq, Muhammad Ali, Mohamed Adel Serhani, Zouheir Trabelsi, Maite L\'opez-S\'anchez</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are integral to intelligent transportation systems, enabling vehicles to offload computational tasks to nearby roadside units (RSUs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) servers for real-time processing. However, the highly dynamic nature of VANETs introduces challenges, such as unpredictable network conditions, high latency, energy inefficiency, and task failure. This research addresses these issues by proposing a hybrid AI framework that integrates supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for intelligent task offloading and resource allocation. The framework leverages supervised models for predicting optimal offloading strategies, reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making, and PSO for optimizing latency and energy consumption. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant reductions in latency and energy usage while improving task success rates and network throughput. By offering an efficient, and scalable solution, this framework sets the foundation for enhancing real-time applications in dynamic vehicular environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Luan, See-Kiong Ng, Chun Kai Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models form an important class of generative models today, accounting for much of the state of the art in cutting edge AI research. While numerous extensions beyond image and video generation exist, few of such approaches address the issue of explicit constraints in the samples generated. In this paper, we study the problem of generating paths in a layered graph (a variant of a directed acyclic graph) using discrete diffusion models, while guaranteeing that our generated samples are indeed paths. Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective representation for paths which we call the padded adjacency-list matrix (PALM). In addition, we show how to effectively perform classifier guidance, which helps steer the sampled paths to specific preferred edges without any retraining of the diffusion model. Our preliminary results show that empirically, our method outperforms alternatives which do not explicitly account for path constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Shi, Chengxun Xie, Zhonghao Li, Xinming Zhang, Miao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The discovery of new molecules based on the original chemical molecule distributions is of great importance in medicine. The graph transformer, with its advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional graph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of graph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to effectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage only sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of molecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based framework for molecular generation, which we call \textbf{JTreeformer} as it transforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN parallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed acyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can iteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the partially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a diffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical results demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule generation methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collin Beaudoin, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying molecular properties, including side effects, is a critical yet time-consuming step in drug development. Failing to detect these side effects before regulatory submission can result in significant financial losses and production delays, and overlooking them during the regulatory review can lead to catastrophic consequences. This challenge presents an opportunity for innovative machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid quantum-classical models like the Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM) network. The QK-LSTM integrates quantum kernel functions into the classical LSTM framework, enabling the capture of complex, non-linear patterns in sequential data. By mapping input data into a high-dimensional quantum feature space, the QK-LSTM model reduces the need for large parameter sets, allowing for model compression without sacrificing accuracy in sequence-based tasks. Recent advancements have been made in the classical domain using augmented variations of the Simplified Molecular Line-Entry System (SMILES). However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has explored the impact of augmented SMILES in the quantum domain, nor the role of augmented Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) in either classical or hybrid quantum-classical settings. This study presents the first analysis of these approaches, providing novel insights into their potential for enhancing molecular property prediction and side effect identification. Results reveal that augmenting SELFIES yields in statistically significant improvements from SMILES by a 5.97% improvement for the classical domain and a 5.91% improvement for the hybrid quantum-classical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collin Beaudoin, Swaroop Ghosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing holds great potential for solving socially relevant and computationally complex problems. Furthermore, quantum machine learning (QML) promises to rapidly improve our current machine learning capabilities. However, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by limitations in the number of qubits and gate counts, which hinder their full capabilities. Furthermore, the design of quantum algorithms remains a laborious task, requiring significant domain expertise and time. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel quantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to generate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that utilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational autoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently generates 100% valid quantum circuit outputs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20821">The When and How of Target Variable Transformations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Loren Nuyts, Jesse Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: The machine learning pipeline typically involves the iterative process of (1) collecting the data, (2) preparing the data, (3) learning a model, and (4) evaluating a model. Practitioners recognize the importance of the data preparation phase in terms of its impact on the ability to learn accurate models. In this regard, significant attention is often paid to manipulating the feature set (e.g., selection, transformations, dimensionality reduction). A point that is less well appreciated is that transformations on the target variable can also have a large impact on whether it is possible to learn a suitable model. These transformations may include accounting for subject-specific biases (e.g., in how someone uses a rating scale), contexts (e.g., population size effects), and general trends (e.g., inflation). However, this point has received a much more cursory treatment in the existing literature. The goal of this paper is three-fold. First, we aim to highlight the importance of this problem by showing when transforming the target variable has been useful in practice. Second, we will provide a set of generic ``rules of thumb'' that indicate situations when transforming the target variable may be needed. Third, we will discuss which transformations should be considered in a given situation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gissel Velarde, Tillman Weyde, David Meredith</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method of classification and segmentation of melodies in symbolic representation. The method is based on filtering pitch as a signal over time with the Haar-wavelet, and we evaluate it on two tasks. The filtered signal corresponds to a single-scale signal ws from the continuous Haar wavelet transform. The melodies are first segmented using local maxima or zero-crossings of w_s. The segments of w_s are then classified using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm with Euclidian and city-block distances. The method proves more effective than using unfiltered pitch signals and Gestalt-based segmentation when used to recognize the parent works of segments from Bach's Two-Part Inventions (BWV 772-786). When used to classify 360 Dutch folk tunes into 26 tune families, the performance of the method is comparable to the use of pitch signals, but not as good as that of string-matching methods based on multiple features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance reasoning within targeted problem spaces in large language models (LLMs) under memory and compute constraints. Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Fang, Huimin Liu, Han Yang, Jiajing Wu, Zibin Zheng, Chi K. Tse</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in addressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks. However, recent studies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial attacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real world, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks and enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of these defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural bias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail nodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes with low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the hetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low degree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is adopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of graph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and debiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayananda Herurkar, J\"orn Hees, Vesselin Tzvetkov, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Learning approaches is often based and demonstrated on large public datasets. However, when applying such approaches to internal, private datasets, one frequently faces challenges arising from structural differences in the datasets, domain shift, and the lack of labels. In this work, we introduce Tabular Data Adapters (TDA), a novel method for generating soft labels for unlabeled tabular data in outlier detection tasks. By identifying statistically similar public datasets and transforming private data (based on a shared autoencoder) into a format compatible with state-of-the-art public models, our approach enables the generation of weak labels. It thereby can help to mitigate the cold start problem of labeling by basing on existing outlier detection models for public datasets. In experiments on 50 tabular datasets across different domains, we demonstrate that our method is able to provide more accurate annotations than baseline approaches while reducing computational time. Our approach offers a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution, to bridge the gap between public research models and real-world industrial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyuan Fang, Han Yang, Haixian Wen, Jiajing Wu, Zibin Zheng, Chi K. Tse</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks have been widely utilized to solve graph-related tasks because of their strong learning power in utilizing the local information of neighbors. However, recent studies on graph adversarial attacks have proven that current graph neural networks are not robust against malicious attacks. Yet much of the existing work has focused on the optimization objective based on attack performance to obtain (near) optimal perturbations, but paid less attention to the strength quantification of each perturbation such as the injection of a particular node/link, which makes the choice of perturbations a black-box model that lacks interpretability. In this work, we propose the concept of noise to quantify the attack strength of each adversarial link. Furthermore, we propose three attack strategies based on the defined noise and classification margins in terms of single and multiple steps optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets against three representative graph neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies. Particularly, we also investigate the preferred patterns of effective adversarial perturbations by analyzing the corresponding properties of the selected perturbation nodes.</p>

We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajecto- ries used in training, rather than simply discard- ing them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Merve Karakas, Osama Hanna, Lin F. Yang, Christina Fragouli</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem over arm erasure channels, motivated by the increasing adoption of MAB algorithms over communication-constrained networks. In this setup, the learner communicates the chosen arm to play to an agent over an erasure channel with probability $\epsilon \in [0,1)$; if an erasure occurs, the agent continues pulling the last successfully received arm; the learner always observes the reward of the arm pulled. In past work, we considered the case where the agent cannot convey feedback to the learner, and thus the learner does not know whether the arm played is the requested or the last successfully received one. In this paper, we instead consider the case where the agent can send feedback to the learner on whether the arm request was received, and thus the learner exactly knows which arm was played. Surprisingly, we prove that erasure feedback does not improve the worst-case regret upper bound order over the previously studied no-feedback setting. In particular, we prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT} + K / (1 - \epsilon))$, where $K$ is the number of arms and $T$ the time horizon, that matches no-feedback upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. We note however that the availability of feedback enables simpler algorithm designs that may achieve better constants (albeit not better order) regret bounds; we design one such algorithm and evaluate its performance numerically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayananda Herurkar, Ahmad Ali, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have revolutionized multiple domains, yet their application to tabular data remains underexplored. Evaluating generative models for tabular data presents unique challenges due to structural complexity, large-scale variability, and mixed data types, making it difficult to intuitively capture intricate patterns. Existing evaluation metrics offer only partial insights, lacking a comprehensive measure of generative performance. To address this limitation, we propose three novel evaluation metrics: FAED, FPCAD, and RFIS. Our extensive experimental analysis, conducted on three standard network intrusion detection datasets, compares these metrics with established evaluation methods such as Fidelity, Utility, TSTR, and TRTS. Our results demonstrate that FAED effectively captures generative modeling issues overlooked by existing metrics. While FPCAD exhibits promising performance, further refinements are necessary to enhance its reliability. Our proposed framework provides a robust and practical approach for assessing generative models in tabular data applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxin Chen, Weishen Pan, Kyra Gan, Fei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying subgroups that benefit from specific treatments using observational data is a critical challenge in personalized medicine. Most existing approaches solely focus on identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. However, practical considerations, such as ensuring a minimum subgroup size for representativeness or achieving sufficient confounder balance for reliability, are also important for making findings clinically meaningful and actionable. While some studies address these constraints individually, none offer a unified approach to handle them simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic framework for optimal subgroup identification under multiple constraints. We reformulate this combinatorial problem as an unconstrained min-max optimization problem with novel modifications and solve it by a gradient descent ascent algorithm. We further prove its convergence to a feasible and locally optimal solution. Our method is stable and highly flexible, supporting various models and techniques for estimating and optimizing treatment effectiveness with observational data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying subgroups that satisfy multiple constraints, achieving higher treatment effects and better confounder balancing results across different group sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Leyli-abadi, Jean-Patrick Brunet, Axel Tahmasebimoradi</p>
<p>Abstract: Based on recent studies, some COVID-19 symptoms can persist for months after infection, leading to what is termed long COVID. Factors such as vaccination timing, patient characteristics, and symptoms during the acute phase of infection may contribute to the prolonged effects and intensity of long COVID. Each patient, based on their unique combination of factors, develops a specific risk or intensity of long COVID. In this work, we aim to achieve two objectives: (1) conduct a statistical analysis to identify relationships between various factors and long COVID, and (2) perform predictive analysis of long COVID intensity using these factors. We benchmark and interpret various data-driven approaches, including linear models, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks, using data from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort. Our results show that Neural Networks (NN) achieve the best performance in terms of MAPE, with predictions averaging 19\% error. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals key factors such as loss of smell, headache, muscle pain, and vaccination timing as significant predictors, while chronic disease and gender are critical risk factors.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20932">Improvements of Dark Experience Replay and Reservoir Sampling towards Better Balance between Consolidation and Plasticity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Taisuke Kobayashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills. For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently. DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them. However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them. In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects. This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity. The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it. To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS. Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs. RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data. These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengfu He, Junxuan Wang, Rui Lin, Xuyang Ge, Wentao Shu, Qiong Tang, Junping Zhang, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Low-Rank Sparse Attention (Lorsa), a sparse replacement model of Transformer attention layers to disentangle original Multi Head Self Attention (MHSA) into individually comprehensible components. Lorsa is designed to address the challenge of attention superposition to understand attention-mediated interaction between features in different token positions. We show that Lorsa heads find cleaner and finer-grained versions of previously discovered MHSA behaviors like induction heads, successor heads and attention sink behavior (i.e., heavily attending to the first token). Lorsa and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) are both sparse dictionary learning methods applied to different Transformer components, and lead to consistent findings in many ways. For instance, we discover a comprehensive family of arithmetic-specific Lorsa heads, each corresponding to an atomic operation in Llama-3.1-8B. Automated interpretability analysis indicates that Lorsa achieves parity with SAE in interpretability while Lorsa exhibits superior circuit discovery properties, especially for features computed collectively by multiple MHSA heads. We also conduct extensive experiments on architectural design ablation, Lorsa scaling law and error analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Watson, Rajeev Alur, Divya Gopinath, Ravi Mangal, Corina S. Pasareanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of autonomous systems that use deep neural networks for perception. Formal verification of these systems is challenging due to the size and complexity of the perception DNNs as well as hard-to-quantify, changing environment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic verification framework for autonomous systems based on the following key concepts: (1) Scenario-based Modeling: We decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a composition of scenarios, each representing a different environment condition. (2) Probabilistic Abstractions: For each scenario, we build a compact abstraction of perception based on the DNN's performance on an offline dataset that represents the scenario's environment condition. (3) Symbolic Reasoning and Acceleration: The abstractions enable efficient compositional verification of the autonomous system via symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds the error probability of the system under arbitrary variations of environment conditions. We illustrate our approach on two case studies: an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs and a simulation model of an F1Tenth autonomous car using LiDAR observations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying physiological and behavioral markers for mental health conditions is a longstanding challenge in psychiatry. Depression and suicidal ideation, in particular, lack objective biomarkers, with screening and diagnosis primarily relying on self-reports and clinical interviews. Here, we investigate eye tracking as a potential marker modality for screening purposes. Eye movements are directly modulated by neuronal networks and have been associated with attentional and mood-related patterns; however, their predictive value for depression and suicidality remains unclear. We recorded eye-tracking sequences from 126 young adults as they read and responded to affective sentences, and subsequently developed a deep learning framework to predict their clinical status. The proposed model included separate branches for trials of positive and negative sentiment, and used 2D time-series representations to account for both intra-trial and inter-trial variations. We were able to identify depression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and suicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852). The model also exhibited moderate, yet significant, accuracy in differentiating depressed from suicidal participants, with 0.609 AUC (95% CI 0.571-0.646). Discriminative patterns emerge more strongly when assessing the data relative to response generation than relative to the onset time of the final word of the sentences. The most pronounced effects were observed for negative-sentiment sentences, that are congruent to depressed and suicidal participants. Our findings highlight eye tracking as an objective tool for mental health assessment and underscore the modulatory impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive processes affecting oculomotor control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikui Cai, Shayan Shabihi, Bang An, Zora Che, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zayd M. K. Zuhri, Erland Hilman Fuadi, Alham Fikri Aji</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce softpick, a rectified, not sum-to-one, drop-in replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms that eliminates attention sink and massive activations. Our experiments with 340M parameter models demonstrate that softpick maintains performance parity with softmax on standard benchmarks while achieving 0% sink rate. The softpick transformer produces hidden states with significantly lower kurtosis (340 vs 33,510) and creates sparse attention maps (46.97% sparsity). Models using softpick consistently outperform softmax when quantized, with particularly pronounced advantages at lower bit precisions. Our analysis and discussion shows how softpick has the potential to open new possibilities for quantization, low-precision training, sparsity optimization, pruning, and interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Nyholm, Oscar Carlsson, Maurice Weiler, Daniel Persson</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for non-linear equivariant neural network layers on homogeneous spaces. The seminal work of Cohen et al. on equivariant $G$-CNNs on homogeneous spaces characterized the representation theory of such layers in the linear setting, finding that they are given by convolutions with kernels satisfying so-called steerability constraints. Motivated by the empirical success of non-linear layers, such as self-attention or input dependent kernels, we set out to generalize these insights to the non-linear setting. We derive generalized steerability constraints that any such layer needs to satisfy and prove the universality of our construction. The insights gained into the symmetry-constrained functional dependence of equivariant operators on feature maps and group elements informs the design of future equivariant neural network layers. We demonstrate how several common equivariant network architectures - $G$-CNNs, implicit steerable kernel networks, conventional and relative position embedded attention based transformers, and LieTransformers - may be derived from our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atul Sharma, Kavindu Herath, Saurabh Bagchi, Chaoyue Liu, Somali Chaterji</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Hubs and Spokes Learning (HSL) framework, a novel paradigm for collaborative machine learning that combines the strengths of Federated Learning (FL) and Decentralized Learning (P2PL). HSL employs a two-tier communication structure that avoids the single point of failure inherent in FL and outperforms the state-of-the-art P2PL framework, Epidemic Learning Local (ELL). At equal communication budgets (total edges), HSL achieves higher performance than ELL, while at significantly lower communication budgets, it can match ELL's performance. For instance, with only 400 edges, HSL reaches the same test accuracy that ELL achieves with 1000 edges for 100 peers (spokes) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating its suitability for resource-constrained systems. HSL also achieves stronger consensus among nodes after mixing, resulting in improved performance with fewer training rounds. We substantiate these claims through rigorous theoretical analyses and extensive experimental results, showcasing HSL's practicality for large-scale collaborative learning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20997">Toward Efficient Exploration by Large Language Model Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dilip Arumugam, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ambedkar Dukkipati, Kawin Mayilvaghanan, Naveen Kumar Pallekonda, Sai Prakash Hadnoor, Ranga Shaarad Ayyagari</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluctuations in stock prices are influenced by a complex interplay of factors that go beyond mere historical data. These factors, themselves influenced by external forces, encompass inter-stock dynamics, broader economic factors, various government policy decisions, outbreaks of wars, etc. Furthermore, all of these factors are dynamic and exhibit changes over time. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle the forecasting problem under external influence by proposing learning mechanisms that not only learn from historical trends but also incorporate external knowledge from temporal knowledge graphs. Since there are no such datasets or temporal knowledge graphs available, we study this problem with stock market data, and we construct comprehensive temporal knowledge graph datasets. In our proposed approach, we model relations on external temporal knowledge graphs as events of a Hawkes process on graphs. With extensive experiments, we show that learned dynamic representations effectively rank stocks based on returns across multiple holding periods, outperforming related baselines on relevant metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhang, Zhiyu Wu, Yi Mu, Banruo Liu, Myungjin Lee, Fan Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse applications, ranging from interactive chatbots and cloud AIOps to intelligent agents, has introduced a wide spectrum of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These workloads include latency-sensitive requests focused on per-token latency in streaming chat, throughput-intensive requests that require rapid full responses to invoke tools, and collective requests with dynamic dependencies arising from self-reflection or agent-based reasoning. This workload diversity, amplified by unpredictable request information such as response lengths and runtime dependencies, makes existing schedulers inadequate even within their design envelopes.
  In this paper, we define service gain as the useful service delivered by completing requests. We observe that as SLO directly reflects the actual performance needs of requests, completing a request much faster than its SLO (e.g., deadline) yields limited additional service gain. Based on this insight, we introduce Tempo, the first systematic SLO-aware scheduler designed to maximize service gain across diverse LLM workloads. Tempo allocates just enough serving bandwidth to meet each SLO, maximizing residual capacity for others best-effort workloads. Instead of assuming request information or none at all, it adopts a hybrid scheduling strategy: using quantile-based response upper bounds and dependency-graph matching for conservative initial estimates, prioritizing requests by service gain density, and refining decisions online as generation progresses. Our evaluation across diverse workloads, including chat, reasoning, and agentic pipelines, shows that Tempo improves end-to-end service gain by up to 8.3$\times$ and achieves up to 10.3$\times$ SLO goodput compared to state-of-the-art designs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khurram Khalil, Khaza Anuarul Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of approximate computing in deep neural network accelerators (AxDNNs) promises significant energy efficiency gains. However, permanent faults in AxDNNs can severely degrade their performance compared to their accurate counterparts (AccDNNs). Traditional fault detection and mitigation approaches, while effective for AccDNNs, introduce substantial overhead and latency, making them impractical for energy-constrained real-time deployment. To address this, we introduce EPSILON, a lightweight framework that leverages pre-computed statistical signatures and layer-wise importance metrics for efficient fault detection and mitigation in AxDNNs. Our framework introduces a novel non-parametric pattern-matching algorithm that enables constant-time fault detection without interrupting normal execution while dynamically adapting to different network architectures and fault patterns. EPSILON maintains model accuracy by intelligently adjusting mitigation strategies based on a statistical analysis of weight distribution and layer criticality while preserving the energy benefits of approximate computing. Extensive evaluations across various approximate multipliers, AxDNN architectures, popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k), and fault scenarios demonstrate that EPSILON maintains 80.05\% accuracy while offering 22\% improvement in inference time and 28\% improvement in energy efficiency, establishing EPSILON as a practical solution for deploying reliable AxDNNs in safety-critical edge applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: To responsibly develop Generative AI (GenAI) products, it is critical to define the scope of acceptable inputs and outputs. What constitutes a "safe" response is an actively debated question. Academic work puts an outsized focus on evaluating models by themselves for general purpose aspects such as toxicity, bias, and fairness, especially in conversational applications being used by a broad audience. In contrast, less focus is put on considering sociotechnical systems in specialized domains. Yet, those specialized systems can be subject to extensive and well-understood legal and regulatory scrutiny. These product-specific considerations need to be set in industry-specific laws, regulations, and corporate governance requirements. In this paper, we aim to highlight AI content safety considerations specific to the financial services domain and outline an associated AI content risk taxonomy. We compare this taxonomy to existing work in this space and discuss implications of risk category violations on various stakeholders. We evaluate how existing open-source technical guardrail solutions cover this taxonomy by assessing them on data collected via red-teaming activities. Our results demonstrate that these guardrails fail to detect most of the content risks we discuss.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores the use of deep residual networks for pricing European options on Petrobras, one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and compares its performance with the Black-Scholes (BS) model. Using eight years of historical data from B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange) collected via web scraping, a deep learning model was trained using a custom built hybrid loss function that incorporates market data and analytical pricing. The data for training and testing were drawn between the period spanning November 2016 to January 2025, using an 80-20 train-test split. The test set consisted of data from the final three months: November, December, and January 2025. The deep residual network model achieved a 64.3\% reduction in the mean absolute error for the 3-19 BRL (Brazilian Real) range when compared to the Black-Scholes model on the test set. Furthermore, unlike the Black-Scholes solution, which tends to decrease its accuracy for longer periods of time, the deep learning model performed accurately for longer expiration periods. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in financial modeling, with future work focusing on specialized models for different price ranges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a core task in drug development and precision medicine in the biomedical field. However, traditional machine learning methods generally have the black box problem, which makes it difficult to reveal the deep correlation between the model decision mechanism and the interaction pattern between biological molecules. This study proposes a heterogeneous network drug target interaction prediction framework, integrating graph neural network and multi scale signal processing technology to construct a model with both efficient prediction and multi level interpretability. Its technical breakthroughs are mainly reflected in the following three dimensions:Local global feature collaborative perception module. Based on heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network (HGCN), a multi order neighbor aggregation strategy is designed.Multi scale graph signal decomposition and biological interpretation module. A deep hierarchical node feature transform (GWT) architecture is proposed.Contrastive learning combining multi dimensional perspectives and hierarchical representations. By comparing the learning models, the node representations from the two perspectives of HGCN and GWT are aligned and fused, so that the model can integrate multi dimensional information and improve the prediction robustness. Experimental results show that our framework shows excellent prediction performance on all datasets. This study provides a complete solution for drug target discovery from black box prediction to mechanism decoding, and its methodology has important reference value for modeling complex biomolecular interaction systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has made remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by increasingly large deep learning models. However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge.
  This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation.
  Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingbo Li, Anuradha Mathrani, Teo Susnjak</p>
<p>Abstract: Exponential growth in scientific literature has heightened the demand for efficient evidence-based synthesis, driving the rise of the field of Automated Meta-analysis (AMA) powered by natural language processing and machine learning. This PRISMA systematic review introduces a structured framework for assessing the current state of AMA, based on screening 978 papers from 2006 to 2024, and analyzing 54 studies across diverse domains. Findings reveal a predominant focus on automating data processing (57%), such as extraction and statistical modeling, while only 17% address advanced synthesis stages. Just one study (2%) explored preliminary full-process automation, highlighting a critical gap that limits AMA's capacity for comprehensive synthesis. Despite recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and advanced AI, their integration into statistical modeling and higher-order synthesis, such as heterogeneity assessment and bias evaluation, remains underdeveloped. This has constrained AMA's potential for fully autonomous meta-analysis. From our dataset spanning medical (67%) and non-medical (33%) applications, we found that AMA has exhibited distinct implementation patterns and varying degrees of effectiveness in actually improving efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility. While automation has enhanced specific meta-analytic tasks, achieving seamless, end-to-end automation remains an open challenge. As AI systems advance in reasoning and contextual understanding, addressing these gaps is now imperative. Future efforts must focus on bridging automation across all meta-analysis stages, refining interpretability, and ensuring methodological robustness to fully realize AMA's potential for scalable, domain-agnostic synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Testi, Luca Clissa, Matteo Ballabio, Salvatore Ricciardi, Federico Baldo, Emanuele Frontoni, Sara Moccia, Gennario Vessio</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models offer significant potential for advancing cell counting applications in neuroscience, medical research, pharmaceutical development, and environmental monitoring. However, implementing these models effectively requires robust operational frameworks. This paper introduces Cell Counting Machine Learning Operations (CC-MLOps), a comprehensive framework that streamlines the integration of ML in cell counting workflows. CC-MLOps encompasses data access and preprocessing, model training, monitoring, explainability features, and sustainability considerations. Through a practical use case, we demonstrate how MLOps principles can enhance model reliability, reduce human error, and enable scalable Cell Counting solutions. This work provides actionable guidance for researchers and laboratory professionals seeking to implement machine learning (ML)- powered cell counting systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyang Hong, Xinkai Wu, Hongyu Sun, Qi Wang, Yuquan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, HimNet. Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing significantly to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun M. Saranathan, Mahmoud Saeedimoghaddam, Brandon Smith, Deepthi Raghunandan, Grey Nearing, Craig Pelissier</p>
<p>Abstract: Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishant Subramani, Jason Eisner, Justin Svegliato, Benjamin Van Durme, Yu Su, Sam Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-using agents that act in the world need to be both useful and safe. Well-calibrated model confidences can be used to weigh the risk versus reward of potential actions, but prior work shows that many models are poorly calibrated. Inspired by interpretability literature exploring the internals of models, we propose a novel class of model-internal confidence estimators (MICE) to better assess confidence when calling tools. MICE first decodes from each intermediate layer of the language model using logitLens and then computes similarity scores between each layer's generation and the final output. These features are fed into a learned probabilistic classifier to assess confidence in the decoded output. On the simulated trial and error (STE) tool-calling dataset using Llama3 models, we find that MICE beats or matches the baselines on smoothed expected calibration error. Using MICE confidences to determine whether to call a tool significantly improves over strong baselines on a new metric, expected tool-calling utility. Further experiments show that MICE is sample-efficient, can generalize zero-shot to unseen APIs, and results in higher tool-calling utility in scenarios with varying risk levels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Cui, Yuli Li, Le-Nam Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Current crowd-counting models often rely on single-modal inputs, such as visual images or wireless signal data, which can result in significant information loss and suboptimal recognition performance. To address these shortcomings, we propose TransFusion, a novel multimodal fusion-based crowd- counting model that integrates Channel State Information (CSI) with image data. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Transformer networks, TransFusion effectively combines these two distinct data modalities, enabling the capture of comprehen- sive global contextual information that is critical for accurate crowd estimation. However, while transformers are well capable of capturing global features, they potentially fail to identify finer- grained, local details essential for precise crowd counting. To mitigate this, we incorporate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the model architecture, enhancing its ability to extract detailed local features that complement the global context provided by the Transformer. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that TransFusion achieves high accuracy with minimal counting errors while maintaining superior efficiency.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20179">Integration Flow Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Wang, Dan Zhang, Joshua Luo, Yin Yang, Feng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Ordinary differential equation (ODE) based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for producing high-quality samples in many applications. However, the ODE-based methods either suffer the discretization error of numerical solvers of ODE, which restricts the quality of samples when only a few NFEs are used, or struggle with training instability. In this paper, we proposed Integration Flow, which directly learns the integral of ODE-based trajectory paths without solving the ODE functions. Moreover, Integration Flow explicitly incorporates the target state $\mathbf{x}_0$ as the anchor state in guiding the reverse-time dynamics. We have theoretically proven this can contribute to both stability and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, Integration Flow is the first model with a unified structure to estimate ODE-based generative models and the first to show the exact straightness of 1-Rectified Flow without reflow. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we show that Integration Flows achieve improved performance when it is applied to existing ODE-based models, such as diffusion models, Rectified Flows, and PFGM++. Specifically, Integration Flow achieves one-step generation on CIFAR10 with FIDs of 2.86 for the Variance Exploding (VE) diffusion model, 3.36 for rectified flow without reflow, and 2.91 for PFGM++; and on ImageNet with FIDs of 4.09 for VE diffusion model, 4.35 for rectified flow without reflow and 4.15 for PFGM++.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce CO2, an efficient algorithm to produce convexly-weighted coresets with respect to generic smooth divergences. By employing a functional Taylor expansion, we show a local equivalence between sufficiently regular losses and their second order approximations, reducing the coreset selection problem to maximum mean discrepancy minimization. We apply CO2 to the Sinkhorn divergence, providing a novel sampling procedure that requires logarithmically many data points to match the approximation guarantees of random sampling. To show this, we additionally verify several new regularity properties for entropically regularized optimal transport of independent interest. Our approach leads to a new perspective linking coreset selection and kernel quadrature to classical statistical methods such as moment and score matching. We showcase this method with a practical application of subsampling image data, and highlight key directions to explore for improved algorithmic efficiency and theoretical guarantees.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of neural network graph compilers across heterogeneous hardware platforms, addressing the critical gap between theoretical optimization techniques and practical deployment scenarios. We demonstrate how vendor-specific optimizations can invalidate relative performance comparisons between architectural archetypes, with performance advantages sometimes completely reversing after compilation. Our systematic analysis reveals that graph compilers exhibit performance patterns highly dependent on both neural architecture and batch sizes. Through fine-grained block-level experimentation, we establish that vendor-specific compilers can leverage repeated patterns in simple architectures, yielding disproportionate throughput gains as model depth increases. We introduce novel metrics to quantify a compiler's ability to mitigate performance friction as batch size increases. Our methodology bridges the gap between academic research and practical deployment by incorporating compiler effects throughout the research process, providing actionable insights for practitioners navigating complex optimization landscapes across heterogeneous hardware environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> P. Trent Vonich, Gregory J. Hakim</p>
<p>Abstract: Atmospheric predictability research has long held that the limit of skillful deterministic weather forecasts is about 14 days. We challenge this limit using GraphCast, a machine-learning weather model, by optimizing forecast initial conditions using gradient-based techniques for twice-daily forecasts spanning 2020. This approach yields an average error reduction of 86% at 10 days, with skill lasting beyond 30 days. Mean optimal initial-condition perturbations reveal large-scale, spatially coherent corrections to ERA5, primarily reflecting an intensification of the Hadley circulation. Forecasts using GraphCast-optimal initial conditions in the Pangu-Weather model achieve a 21% error reduction, peaking at 4 days, indicating that analysis corrections reflect a combination of both model bias and a reduction in analysis error. These results demonstrate that, given accurate initial conditions, skillful deterministic forecasts are consistently achievable far beyond two weeks, challenging long-standing assumptions about the limits of atmospheric predictability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Derek W. Jollie, Scott G. McCalla</p>
<p>Abstract: Many model selection algorithms rely on sparse dictionary learning to provide interpretable and physics-based governing equations. The optimization algorithms typically use a hard thresholding process to enforce sparse activations in the model coefficients by removing library elements from consideration. By introducing an annealing scheme that reactivates a fraction of the removed terms with a cooling schedule, we are able to improve the performance of these sparse learning algorithms. We concentrate on two approaches to the optimization, SINDy, and an alternative using hard thresholding pursuit. We see in both cases that annealing can improve model accuracy. The effectiveness of annealing is demonstrated through comparisons on several nonlinear systems pulled from convective flows, excitable systems, and population dynamics. Finally we apply these algorithms to experimental data for projectile motion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) help improve real-time monitoring and decision-making in water distribution systems. However, their connectivity makes them easy targets for cyberattacks such as scanning, denial-of-service (DoS), and unauthorized access. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that manage these systems often do not have enough budget or staff to build strong cybersecurity teams. To solve this problem, we present a Virtual Cybersecurity Department (VCD), an affordable and automated framework designed for SMEs. The VCD uses open-source tools like Zabbix for real-time monitoring, Suricata for network intrusion detection, Fail2Ban to block repeated login attempts, and simple firewall settings. To improve threat detection, we also add a machine-learning-based IDS trained on the OD-IDS2022 dataset using an improved ensemble model. This model detects cyber threats such as brute-force attacks, remote code execution (RCE), and network flooding, with 92\% accuracy and fewer false alarms. Our solution gives SMEs a practical and efficient way to secure water systems using low-cost and easy-to-manage tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Water distribution systems in rural areas face serious challenges such as a lack of real-time monitoring, vulnerability to cyberattacks, and unreliable data handling. This paper presents an integrated framework that combines LoRaWAN-based data acquisition, a machine learning-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and a blockchain-enabled Digital Twin (BC-DT) platform for secure and transparent water management. The IDS filters anomalous or spoofed data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder and Isolation Forest before validated data is logged via smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. The verified data feeds into a real-time DT model supporting leak detection, consumption forecasting, and predictive maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves over 80 transactions per second (TPS) with under 2 seconds of latency while remaining cost-effective and scalable for up to 1,000 smart meters. This work demonstrates a practical and secure architecture for decentralized water infrastructure in under-connected rural environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumit Mamtani, Yash Thesia</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification aims to recognize objects belonging to multiple subordinate categories within a super-category. However, this remains a challenging problem, as appearance information alone is often insufficient to accurately differentiate between fine-grained visual categories. To address this, we propose a novel and unified framework that leverages meta-information to assist fine-grained identification. We tackle the joint learning of visual and meta-information through cross-contrastive pre-training. In the first stage, we employ three encoders for images, text, and meta-information, aligning their projected embeddings to achieve better representations. We then fine-tune the image and meta-information encoders for the classification task. Experiments on the NABirds dataset demonstrate that our framework effectively utilizes meta-information to enhance fine-grained recognition performance. With the addition of meta-information, our framework surpasses the current baseline on NABirds by 7.83%. Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy of 84.44% on the NABirds dataset, outperforming many existing state-of-the-art approaches that utilize meta-information.</p>

<p>Abstract: This report addresses the challenge of limited labeled datasets for developing legal recommender systems, particularly in specialized domains like labor disputes. We propose a new approach leveraging the co-citation of legal articles within cases to establish similarity and enable algorithmic annotation. This method draws a parallel to the concept of case co-citation, utilizing cited precedents as indicators of shared legal issues. To evaluate the labeled results, we employ a system that recommends similar cases based on plaintiffs' accusations, defendants' rebuttals, and points of disputes. The evaluation demonstrates that the recommender, with finetuned text embedding models and a reasonable BiLSTM module can recommend labor cases whose similarity was measured by the co-citation of the legal articles. This research contributes to the development of automated annotation techniques for legal documents, particularly in areas with limited access to comprehensive legal databases.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the use of prompts to guide the output of Large Language Models have increased dramatically. However, even the best of experts struggle to choose the correct words to stitch up a prompt for the desired task. To solve this, LLM driven prompt optimization emerged as an important problem. Existing prompt optimization methods optimize a prompt globally, where in all the prompt tokens have to be optimized over a large vocabulary while solving a complex task. The large optimization space (tokens) leads to insufficient guidance for a better prompt. In this work, we introduce Local Prompt Optimization (LPO) that integrates with any general automatic prompt engineering method. We identify the optimization tokens in a prompt and nudge the LLM to focus only on those tokens in its optimization step. We observe remarkable performance improvements on Math Reasoning (GSM8k and MultiArith) and BIG-bench Hard benchmarks across various automatic prompt engineering methods. Further, we show that LPO converges to the optimal prompt faster than global methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Gordon, Panayiotis Petousis, Susanne B. Nicholas, Alex A. T. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Diagnostic reasoning entails a physician's local (mental) model based on an assumed or known shared perspective (global model) to explain patient observations with evidence assigned towards a clinical assessment. But in several (complex) medical situations, multiple experts work together as a team to optimize health evaluation and decision-making by leveraging different perspectives. Such consensus-driven reasoning reflects individual knowledge contributing toward a broader perspective on the patient. In this light, we introduce STRUCture-following for Multiagent Systems (STRUC-MAS), a framework automating the learning of these global models and their incorporation as prior beliefs for agents in multiagent systems (MAS) to follow. We demonstrate proof of concept with a prosocial MAS application for predicting acute kidney injuries (AKIs). In this case, we found that incorporating a global structure enabled multiple agents to achieve better performance (average precision, AP) in predicting AKI 48 hours before onset (structure-following-fine-tuned, SF-FT, AP=0.195; SF-FT-retrieval-augmented generation, SF-FT-RAG, AP=0.194) vs. baseline (non-structure-following-FT, NSF-FT, AP=0.141; NSF-FT-RAG, AP=0.180) for balanced precision-weighted-recall-weighted voting. Markedly, SF-FT agents with higher recall scores reported lower confidence levels in the initial round on true positive and false negative cases. But after explicit interactions, their confidence in their decisions increased (suggesting reinforced belief). In contrast, the SF-FT agent with the lowest recall decreased its confidence in true positive and false negative cases (suggesting a new belief). This approach suggests that learning and leveraging global structures in MAS is necessary prior to achieving competitive classification and diagnostic reasoning performance.</p>

In this work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully linear media.

Leveraging this positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated, topology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized optical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and machine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning classification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear methods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Sethi, Sai Reddy, Mansi Sakarvadia, Jordan Serotte, Darlington Nwaudo, Nicholas Maassen, Lewis Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, existing work has largely focused on pathologies where diagnosis is not a clinical challenge, leaving more difficult problems underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. Diagnosing these lesions is challenging due to their subtle imaging features, often leading to reliance on invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This study introduces ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and presents a deep learning (DL) framework for detecting Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI includes 586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent arthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the gold standard for diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were trained using a combination of CNNs and transformers. Predictions from sagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The models were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71 standard MRIs). The models achieved an AUC of 0.91 and 0.93, sensitivity of 83% and 94%, and specificity of 91% and 86% for standard MRIs and MRAs, respectively. Notably, model performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched or surpassed radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. This study demonstrates that DL models can achieve radiologist-level diagnostic performance on standard MRIs, reducing the need for invasive MRAs. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluating deep learning models on 3D medical imaging data, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and support the development of new datasets for clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Combining physics-based modeling with data-driven methods is critical to enabling the translation of computational methods to clinical use in cardiology. The use of rigorous differential equations combined with machine learning tools allows for model personalization with uncertainty quantification in time frames compatible with clinical practice. However, accurate and efficient surrogate models of cardiac function, built from physics-based numerical simulation, are still mostly geometry-specific and require retraining for different patients and pathological conditions. We propose a novel computational pipeline to embed cardiac anatomies into full-field surrogate models. We generate a dataset of electrophysiology simulations using a complex multi-scale mathematical model coupling partial and ordinary differential equations. We adopt Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) as an effective scientific machine learning method to encode activation maps extracted from physics-based numerical simulations into a neural network. Leveraging large deformation diffeomorphic metric mappings, we build a biventricular anatomical atlas and parametrize the anatomical variability of a small and challenging cohort of 13 pediatric patients affected by Tetralogy of Fallot. We propose a novel statistical shape modeling based z-score sampling approach to generate a new synthetic cohort of 52 biventricular geometries that are compatible with the original geometrical variability. This synthetic cohort acts as the training set for BLNMs. Our surrogate model demonstrates robustness and great generalization across the complex original patient cohort, achieving an average adimensional mean squared error of 0.0034.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huimin Lu, Masaru Isonuma, Junichiro Mori, Ichiro Sakata</p>
<p>Abstract: We present UniDetox, a universally applicable method designed to mitigate toxicity across various large language models (LLMs). Previous detoxification methods are typically model-specific, addressing only individual models or model families, and require careful hyperparameter tuning due to the trade-off between detoxification efficacy and language modeling performance. In contrast, UniDetox provides a detoxification technique that can be universally applied to a wide range of LLMs without the need for separate model-specific tuning. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient dataset distillation technique for detoxification using contrastive decoding. This approach distills detoxifying representations in the form of synthetic text data, enabling universal detoxification of any LLM through fine-tuning with the distilled text. Our experiments demonstrate that the detoxifying text distilled from GPT-2 can effectively detoxify larger models, including OPT, Falcon, and LLaMA-2. Furthermore, UniDetox eliminates the need for separate hyperparameter tuning for each model, as a single hyperparameter configuration can be seamlessly applied across different models. Additionally, analysis of the detoxifying text reveals a reduction in politically biased content, providing insights into the attributes necessary for effective detoxification of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to address electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs) and shown superior imaging performances, which can be affected by the training dataset, the network architecture and the applied loss function. Here, the quality of data samples is cared and valued by the defined quality factor. Based on the quality factor, the composition of the training dataset is optimized. The network architecture is integrated with the residual connections and channel attention mechanism to improve feature extraction. A loss function that incorporates data-fitting error, physical-information constraints and the desired feature of the solution is designed and analyzed to suppress the background artifacts and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Various numerical analysis are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quality-factor inspired deep neural network (QuaDNN) solver and the imaging performance is finally verified by experimental imaging test.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Sede\~no, Jamal Toutouh, Francisco Chicano</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are very useful methods to address semi-supervised learning (SSL) datasets, thanks to their ability to generate samples similar to real data. This approach, called SSL-GAN has attracted many researchers in the last decade. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to guide the evolution and training of SSL-GANs with great success. In particular, several co-evolutionary approaches have been applied where the two networks of a GAN (the generator and the discriminator) are evolved in separate populations. The co-evolutionary approaches published to date assume some spatial structure of the populations, based on the ideas of cellular evolutionary algorithms. They also create one single individual per generation and follow a generational replacement strategy in the evolution. In this paper, we re-consider those algorithmic design decisions and propose a new co-evolutionary approach, called Co-evolutionary Elitist SSL-GAN (CE-SSLGAN), with panmictic population, elitist replacement, and more than one individual in the offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that creating more than one offspring per population and using elitism improves the results in comparison with a classical SSL-GAN.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ReasonIR-8B, the first retriever specifically trained for general reasoning tasks. Existing retrievers have shown limited gains on reasoning tasks, in part because existing training datasets focus on short factual queries tied to documents that straightforwardly answer them. We develop a synthetic data generation pipeline that, for each document, our pipeline creates a challenging and relevant query, along with a plausibly related but ultimately unhelpful hard negative. By training on a mixture of our synthetic data and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a widely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When applied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4% and 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming other retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time compute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases with longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to outperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker. Our training recipe is general and can be easily extended to future LLMs; to this end, we open-source our code, data, and model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Pasula, Deepak N. Subramani</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change alters ocean conditions, notably temperature and sea level. In the Bay of Bengal, these changes influence monsoon precipitation and marine productivity, critical to the Indian economy. In Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), Global Climate Models (GCMs) use different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to obtain future climate projections. However, significant discrepancies are observed between these models and the reanalysis data in the Bay of Bengal for 2015-2024. Specifically, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the climate model output and the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5) is 1.2C for the sea surface temperature (SST) and 1.1 m for the dynamic sea level (DSL). We introduce a new data-driven deep learning model to correct for this bias. The deep neural model for each variable is trained using pairs of climatology-removed monthly climate projections as input and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as output. This model is trained with historical data (1950 to 2014), validated with future projection data from 2015 to 2020, and tested with future projections from 2021 to 2023. Compared to the conventional EquiDistant Cumulative Distribution Function (EDCDF) statistical method for bias correction in climate models, our approach decreases RMSE by 0.15C for SST and 0.3 m for DSL. The trained model subsequently corrects the projections for 2024-2100. A detailed analysis of the monthly, seasonal, and decadal means and variability is performed to underscore the implications of the novel dynamics uncovered in our corrected projections.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Fitzgibbon, Stephen Felix</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale numerical computations make increasing use of low-precision (LP) floating point formats and mixed precision arithmetic, which can be enhanced by the technique of stochastic rounding (SR), that is, rounding an intermediate high-precision value up or down randomly as a function of the value's distance to the two rounding candidates. Stochastic rounding requires, in addition to the high-precision input value, a source of random bits. As the provision of high-quality random bits is an additional computational cost, it is of interest to require as few bits as possible while maintaining the desirable properties of SR in a given computation, or computational domain. This paper examines a number of possible implementations of few-bit stochastic rounding (FBSR), and shows how several natural implementations can introduce sometimes significant bias into the rounding process, which are not present in the case of infinite-bit, infinite-precision examinations of these implementations. The paper explores the impact of these biases in machine learning examples, and hence opens another class of configuration parameters of which practitioners should be aware when developing or adopting low-precision floating point.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Mizrahi, Chen Shani, Gabriel Stanovsky, Dan Jurafsky, Dafna Shahaf</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at countless tasks, yet struggle with creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with structured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate more creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured representations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively explore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater diversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsh Vardhan, Avishek Ghosh, Arya Mazumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: In many, if not most, machine learning applications the training data is naturally heterogeneous (e.g. federated learning, adversarial attacks and domain adaptation in neural net training). Data heterogeneity is identified as one of the major challenges in modern day large-scale learning. A classical way to represent heterogeneous data is via a mixture model. In this paper, we study generalization performance and statistical rates when data is sampled from a mixture distribution. We first characterize the heterogeneity of the mixture in terms of the pairwise total variation distance of the sub-population distributions. Thereafter, as a central theme of this paper, we characterize the range where the mixture may be treated as a single (homogeneous) distribution for learning. In particular, we study the generalization performance under the classical PAC framework and the statistical error rates for parametric (linear regression, mixture of hyperplanes) as well as non-parametric (Lipschitz, convex and H\"older-smooth) regression problems. In order to do this, we obtain Rademacher complexity and (local) Gaussian complexity bounds with mixture data, and apply them to get the generalization and convergence rates respectively. We observe that as the (regression) function classes get more complex, the requirement on the pairwise total variation distance gets stringent, which matches our intuition. We also do a finer analysis for the case of mixed linear regression and provide a tight bound on the generalization error in terms of heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Hani Itani, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning trace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its conclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by posing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent the model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different results? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps, termed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach involves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on linguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from the end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer from every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We find that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the mode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on the answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency among the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics that correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting potential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various LLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025) show consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\% and 10\% respectively.

However, they often suffer from short descriptions and outdated or insufficient information. In this paper, we introduce Zad, a system designed to enrich NVD vulnerability descriptions by leveraging external resources. Zad consists of two pipelines: one collects and filters supplementary data using two encoders to build a detailed dataset, while the other fine-tunes a pre-trained model on this dataset to generate enriched descriptions. By addressing brevity and improving content quality, Zad produces more comprehensive and cohesive vulnerability descriptions. We evaluate Zad using standard summarization metrics and human assessments, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing vulnerability information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woongyeong Yeo, Kangsan Kim, Soyeong Jeong, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it. Also, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple modalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the early days of the Explainable AI movement, post-hoc explanations have been praised for their potential to improve user understanding, promote trust, and reduce patient safety risks in black box medical AI systems. Recently, however, critics have argued that the benefits of post-hoc explanations are greatly exaggerated since they merely approximate, rather than replicate, the actual reasoning processes that black box systems take to arrive at their outputs. In this article, we aim to defend the value of post-hoc explanations against this recent critique. We argue that even if post-hoc explanations do not replicate the exact reasoning processes of black box systems, they can still improve users' functional understanding of black box systems, increase the accuracy of clinician-AI teams, and assist clinicians in justifying their AI-informed decisions. While post-hoc explanations are not a "silver bullet" solution to the black box problem in medical AI, we conclude that they remain a useful strategy for addressing the black box problem in medical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Abramov, Felix Steinbauer, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated great success in facilitating the reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malte Luttermann, Jan Speller, Marcel Gehrke, Tanya Braun, Ralf M\"oller, Mattis Hartwig</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial and time-consuming task in clinical care, where mask precision is extremely important. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a promising approach, as it provides an interactive interface based on visual prompting and edition to refine an initial segmentation. This model has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined classes, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural images and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition, this model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on 3D images, such as CT and MRI. Recent adaptations of SAM for medical imaging are based on 2D models, thus requiring one prompt per slice to segment 3D objects, making the segmentation process tedious. They also lack important features such as editing. To bridge this gap, we propose RadSAM, a novel method for segmenting 3D objects with a 2D model from a single prompt. In practice, we train a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding boxes and points. We then use this novel prompt type with an iterative inference pipeline to reconstruct the 3D mask slice-by-slice. We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the model's ability to segment 3D objects in CT images from a single prompt and evaluate the models' out-of-domain transfer and edition capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against state-of-the-art models on this benchmark using the AMOS abdominal organ segmentation dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: As new products are emerging daily, recommendation systems are required to quickly adapt to possible new domains without needing extensive retraining. This work presents ``X-Cross'' -- a novel cross-domain sequential-recommendation model that recommends products in new domains by integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Given a recommendation prompt, operating layer by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source language model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools, Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective. Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over alternative cross-domain baselines. Overall, X-Cross enables scalable and adaptive cross-domain recommendations, reducing computational overhead and providing an efficient solution for data-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meltem Tatl{\i}, Arpan Mukherjee, Prashanth L. A., Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: The objective of canonical multi-armed bandits is to identify and repeatedly select an arm with the largest reward, often in the form of the expected value of the arm's probability distribution. Such a utilitarian perspective and focus on the probability models' first moments, however, is agnostic to the distributions' tail behavior and their implications for variability and risks in decision-making. This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting from expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed a preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different reward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that incorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward uncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric perspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly different principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal sampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in the PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of arms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs from the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways, primarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities. The paper formalizes the PM-centric framework and presents two algorithm classes (horizon-dependent and anytime) that learn and track mixtures in a regret-efficient fashion. These algorithms have two distinctions from their canonical counterparts: (i) they involve an estimation routine to form reliable estimates of optimal mixtures, and (ii) they are equipped with tracking mechanisms to navigate arm selection fractions to track the optimal mixtures. These algorithms' regret guarantees are investigated under various algebraic forms of the PMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Bhaskara, Sepideh Mahabadi, Madhusudhan Reddy Pittu, Ali Vakilian, David P. Woodruff</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we study constrained subspace approximation problem. Given a set of $n$ points $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the goal of the {\em subspace approximation} problem is to find a $k$ dimensional subspace that best approximates the input points. More precisely, for a given $p\geq 1$, we aim to minimize the $p$th power of the $\ell_p$ norm of the error vector $(\|a_1-\bm{P}a_1\|,\ldots,\|a_n-\bm{P}a_n\|)$, where $\bm{P}$ denotes the projection matrix onto the subspace and the norms are Euclidean. In \emph{constrained} subspace approximation (CSA), we additionally have constraints on the projection matrix $\bm{P}$. In its most general form, we require $\bm{P}$ to belong to a given subset $\mathcal{S}$ that is described explicitly or implicitly.
  We introduce a general framework for constrained subspace approximation. Our approach, that we term coreset-guess-solve, yields either $(1+\varepsilon)$-multiplicative or $\varepsilon$-additive approximations for a variety of constraints. We show that it provides new algorithms for partition-constrained subspace approximation with applications to {\it fair} subspace approximation, $k$-means clustering, and projected non-negative matrix factorization, among others. Specifically, while we reconstruct the best known bounds for $k$-means clustering in Euclidean spaces, we improve the known results for the remainder of the problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Guimard, Moreno D'Inc\`a, Massimiliano Mancini, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its biases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have access to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work, we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a large language model to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no constraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Shokouhinejad, Roozbeh Razavi-Far, Griffin Higgins, Ali A. Ghorbani</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretable malware detection is crucial for understanding harmful behaviors and building trust in automated security systems. Traditional explainable methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often highlight important regions within a graph but fail to associate them with known benign or malicious behavioral patterns. This limitation reduces their utility in security contexts, where alignment with verified prototypes is essential. In this work, we introduce a novel dual prototype-driven explainable framework that interprets GNN-based malware detection decisions. This dual explainable framework integrates a base explainer (a state-of-the-art explainer) with a novel second-level explainer which is designed by subgraph matching technique, called SubMatch explainer. The proposed explainer assigns interpretable scores to nodes based on their association with matched subgraphs, offering a fine-grained distinction between benign and malicious regions. This prototype-guided scoring mechanism enables more interpretable, behavior-aligned explanations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves high detection performance while significantly improving interpretability in malware analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarad Venugopalan, Sridhar Adepu</p>
<p>Abstract: The continuous monitoring of the interactions between cyber-physical components of any industrial control system (ICS) is required to secure automation of the system controls, and to guarantee plant processes are fail-safe and remain in an acceptably safe state. Safety is achieved by managing actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical movement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in decision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and unascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the safety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided. We propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of the non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily because solving linear models is easier and well understood. Further, the time complexity of the anomaly detection scenario/problem at hand is lowered using dimensionality reduction of the actuator(s) in relationship with a sensor. We accomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case. Our experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies and provide explainability; that are not simultaneously achieved by other state of the art AI/ML models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose. Further, we pin-point the sensor(s) and its actuation state for which anomaly was detected.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Nogales, Matteo Gambella, Manuel Roveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Early exits (EEs) offer a promising approach to reducing computational costs and latency by dynamically terminating inference once a satisfactory prediction confidence on a data sample is achieved. Although many works integrate EEs into encoder-only Transformers, their application to decoder-only architectures and, more importantly, Mamba models, a novel family of state-space architectures in the LLM realm, remains insufficiently explored. This work introduces DYNAMAX, the first framework to exploit the unique properties of Mamba architectures for early exit mechanisms. We not only integrate EEs into Mamba but also repurpose Mamba as an efficient EE classifier for both Mamba-based and transformer-based LLMs, showcasing its versatility. Our experiments employ the Mistral 7B transformer compared to the Codestral 7B Mamba model, using data sets such as TruthfulQA, CoQA, and TriviaQA to evaluate computational savings, accuracy, and consistency. The results highlight the adaptability of Mamba as a powerful EE classifier and its efficiency in balancing computational cost and performance quality across NLP tasks. By leveraging Mamba's inherent design for dynamic processing, we open pathways for scalable and efficient inference in embedded applications and resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the transformative potential of Mamba in redefining dynamic computing paradigms for LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Stupp, P. S. Koutsourelakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models offer an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations, yet conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data-driven dependence limits their accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG model. We introduce a data-free generative framework for coarse-graining that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. Our model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, which are statistically associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, which represent the remaining degrees of freedom with simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A potentially learnable, bijective map from the full latent space to the all-atom configuration space enables automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, relying solely on the interatomic potential rather than sampled trajectories. A tempering scheme is used to stabilize training and promote exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate unbiased, one-shot equilibrium all-atom samples. We validate the method on two synthetic systems-a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture-as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide. The model captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, accurately reconstructs atomic configurations, and learns physically meaningful coarse-grained representations, all without any simulation data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiting Zhang, Shichen Li, Elena Shrestha</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanical search (MS) in cluttered environments remains a significant challenge for autonomous manipulators, requiring long-horizon planning and robust state estimation under occlusions and partial observability. In this work, we introduce XPG-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to efficiently perform MS tasks through explainable, priority-guided decision-making based on raw sensory inputs. XPG-RL integrates a task-driven action prioritization mechanism with a learned context-aware switching strategy that dynamically selects from a discrete set of action primitives such as target grasping, occlusion removal, and viewpoint adjustment. Within this strategy, a policy is optimized to output adaptive threshold values that govern the discrete selection among action primitives. The perception module fuses RGB-D inputs with semantic and geometric features to produce a structured scene representation for downstream decision-making. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that XPG-RL consistently outperforms baseline methods in task success rates and motion efficiency, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ higher efficiency in long-horizon tasks. These results underscore the benefits of integrating domain knowledge with learnable decision-making policies for robust and efficient robotic manipulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of pneumonia through X-ray imaging is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled automated diagnostic tools that assist radiologists in making more reliable and efficient decisions. In this work, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition-based Least Squares (SVD-LS) framework for multi-class pneumonia classification, leveraging powerful feature representations from state-of-the-art self-supervised and transfer learning models. Rather than relying on computationally expensive gradient based fine-tuning, we employ a closed-form, non-iterative classification approach that ensures efficiency without compromising accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-LS achieves competitive performance while offering significantly reduced computational costs, making it a viable alternative for real-time medical imaging applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [$q$-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning; Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We prove worse-case guarantees that significantly improve upon the bounds for previous algorithms. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution.
  In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Wolinski, Julyan Arbel</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of feature propagation at initialization in neural networks lies at the root of numerous initialization designs. An assumption very commonly made in the field states that the pre-activations are Gaussian. Although this convenient Gaussian hypothesis can be justified when the number of neurons per layer tends to infinity, it is challenged by both theoretical and experimental works for finite-width neural networks. Our major contribution is to construct a family of pairs of activation functions and initialization distributions that ensure that the pre-activations remain Gaussian throughout the network's depth, even in narrow neural networks. In the process, we discover a set of constraints that a neural network should fulfill to ensure Gaussian pre-activations. Additionally, we provide a critical review of the claims of the Edge of Chaos line of works and build an exact Edge of Chaos analysis. We also propose a unified view on pre-activations propagation, encompassing the framework of several well-known initialization procedures. Finally, our work provides a principled framework for answering the much-debated question: is it desirable to initialize the training of a neural network whose pre-activations are ensured to be Gaussian?

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grace Zhang, Ayush Jain, Injune Hwang, Shao-Hua Sun, Joseph J. Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to learn several tasks simultaneously for better sample efficiency than learning them separately. Traditional methods achieve this by sharing parameters or relabeled data between tasks. In this work, we introduce a new framework for sharing behavioral policies across tasks, which can be used in addition to existing MTRL methods. The key idea is to improve each task's off-policy data collection by employing behaviors from other task policies. Selectively sharing helpful behaviors acquired in one task to collect training data for another task can lead to higher-quality trajectories, leading to more sample-efficient MTRL. Thus, we introduce a simple and principled framework called Q-switch mixture of policies (QMP) that selectively shares behavior between different task policies by using the task's Q-function to evaluate and select useful shareable behaviors. We theoretically analyze how QMP improves the sample efficiency of the underlying RL algorithm. Our experiments show that QMP's behavioral policy sharing provides complementary gains over many popular MTRL algorithms and outperforms alternative ways to share behaviors in various manipulation, locomotion, and navigation environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Jason D. Lee, Simon S. Du</p>
<p>Abstract: A central issue lying at the heart of online reinforcement learning (RL) is data efficiency. While a number of recent works achieved asymptotically minimal regret in online RL, the optimality of these results is only guaranteed in a ``large-sample'' regime, imposing enormous burn-in cost in order for their algorithms to operate optimally. How to achieve minimax-optimal regret without incurring any burn-in cost has been an open problem in RL theory.
  We settle this problem for the context of finite-horizon inhomogeneous Markov decision processes. Specifically, we prove that a modified version of Monotonic Value Propagation (MVP), a model-based algorithm proposed by \cite{zhang2020reinforcement}, achieves a regret on the order of (modulo log factors) \begin{equation*}
  \min\big\{ \sqrt{SAH^3K}, \,HK \big\}, \end{equation*} where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the planning horizon, and $K$ is the total number of episodes. This regret matches the minimax lower bound for the entire range of sample size $K\geq 1$, essentially eliminating any burn-in requirement. It also translates to a PAC sample complexity (i.e., the number of episodes needed to yield $\varepsilon$-accuracy) of $\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}$ up to log factor, which is minimax-optimal for the full $\varepsilon$-range.
  Further, we extend our theory to unveil the influences of problem-dependent quantities like the optimal value/cost and certain variances. The key technical innovation lies in the development of a new regret decomposition strategy and a novel analysis paradigm to decouple complicated statistical dependency -- a long-standing challenge facing the analysis of online RL in the sample-hungry regime.</p>

Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are gaining attention from academia and industry as a growing subject in industrial applications and as a powerful way of identifying faults. This paper provides an overview of intelligent condition monitoring and fault detection and diagnosis methods for industrial plants with a focus on the open-source benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). In this survey, the most popular and state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for industrial plant condition monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm are studied. Challenges like imbalanced data, unlabelled samples and how deep learning models can handle them are also covered. Finally, a comparison of the accuracies and specifications of different algorithms utilizing the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) is conducted.

<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the application of multiobjective optimization (MOO) in machine learning (ML). This interest is driven by the numerous real-life situations where multiple objectives must be optimized simultaneously. A key aspect of MOO is the existence of a Pareto set, rather than a single optimal solution, which represents the optimal trade-offs between different objectives. Despite its potential, there is a noticeable lack of satisfactory literature serving as an entry-level guide for ML practitioners aiming to apply MOO effectively. In this paper, our goal is to provide such a resource and highlight pitfalls to avoid. We begin by establishing the groundwork for MOO, focusing on well-known approaches such as the weighted sum (WS) method, alongside more advanced techniques like the multiobjective gradient descent algorithm (MGDA). We critically review existing studies across various ML fields where MOO has been applied and identify challenges that can lead to incorrect interpretations. One of these fields is physics informed neural networks (PINNs), which we use as a guiding example to carefully construct experiments illustrating these pitfalls. By comparing WS and MGDA with one of the most common evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II, we demonstrate that difficulties can arise regardless of the specific MOO method used. We emphasize the importance of understanding the specific problem, the objective space, and the selected MOO method, while also noting that neglecting factors such as convergence criteria can result in misleading experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyang Cai, Chuchu Fan, Stanley Bak</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Gabrielli, Bardh Prenkaj, Paola Velardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring the stress level in patients with neurodegenerative diseases can help manage symptoms, improve patient's quality of life, and provide insight into disease progression. In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like wristbands and smartwatches, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a wristband based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we finetuned for the task and equipped with explainability features. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fulong Yao, Wanqing Zhao, Matthew Forshaw, Yang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Data uncertainty is inherent in many real-world applications and poses significant challenges for accurate time series predictions. The interval type 2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) has shown exceptional performance in uncertainty modelling for single-step prediction tasks. However, extending it for multi-step ahead predictions introduces further issues in uncertainty handling as well as model interpretability and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new selforganizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO). Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network architecture is developed. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step time series prediction problems. Second, a new link layer is created to improve the accuracy by building temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Third, a new transformation layer is designed to address the problem of the vanishing rule strength caused by high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, a two-stage, self-organizing learning mechanism is developed to automatically extract fuzzy rules from data and optimize network parameters. Experimental results on chaotic and microgrid prediction problems demonstrate that SOIT2FNN-MO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, by achieving a better accuracy ranging from 1.6% to 30% depending on the level of noises in data. Additionally, the proposed model is more interpretable, offering deeper insights into the prediction process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Ghosh, Arvind Renganathan, Zac McEachran, Kelly Lindsay, Somya Sharma, Michael Steinbach, John Nieber, Christopher Duffy, Vipin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a framework for modeling multi-scale processes, and study its performance in the context of streamflow forecasting in hydrology. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical recurrent neural architecture that factorizes the system dynamics at multiple temporal scales and captures their interactions. This framework consists of an inverse and a forward model. The inverse model is used to empirically resolve the system's temporal modes from data (physical model simulations, observed data, or a combination of them from the past), and these states are then used in the forward model to predict streamflow. Experiments on several catchments from the National Weather Service North Central River Forecast Center show that FHNN outperforms standard baselines, including physics-based models and transformer-based approaches. The model demonstrates particular effectiveness in catchments with low runoff ratios and colder climates. We further validate FHNN on the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies), which is a widely used continental-scale hydrology benchmark dataset, confirming consistent performance improvements for 1-7 day streamflow forecasts across diverse hydrological conditions. Additionally, we show that FHNN can maintain accuracy even with limited training data through effective pre-training strategies and training global models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinwei Zhang, Zhiqi Bu, Borja Balle, Mingyi Hong, Meisam Razaviyayn, Vahab Mirrokni</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) offers a robust framework for safeguarding individual data privacy. To utilize DP in training modern machine learning models, differentially private optimizers have been widely used in recent years. A popular approach to privatize an optimizer is to clip the individual gradients and add sufficiently large noise to the clipped gradient. This approach led to the development of DP optimizers that have comparable performance with their non-private counterparts in fine-tuning tasks or in tasks with a small number of training parameters. However, a significant performance drop is observed when these optimizers are applied to large-scale training. This degradation stems from the substantial noise injection required to maintain DP, which disrupts the optimizer's dynamics. This paper introduces DiSK, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the performance of DP optimizers. DiSK employs Kalman filtering, a technique drawn from control and signal processing, to effectively denoise privatized gradients and generate progressively refined gradient estimations. To ensure practicality for large-scale training, we simplify the Kalman filtering process, minimizing its memory and computational demands. We establish theoretical privacy-utility trade-off guarantees for DiSK, and demonstrate provable improvements over standard DP optimizers like DPSGD in terms of iteration complexity upper-bound. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including vision tasks such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k and language fine-tuning tasks such as GLUE, E2E, and DART, validate the effectiveness of DiSK. The results showcase its ability to significantly improve the performance of DP optimizers, surpassing state-of-the-art results under the same privacy constraints on several benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Musculoskeletal injuries during military training significantly impact readiness, making prevention through activity monitoring crucial. While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices offers promising solutions, it faces challenges in processing continuous data streams and recognizing diverse activities without predefined sessions. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for preprocessing, analyzing, and recognizing activities from wearable data in military training contexts. Using data from 135 soldiers wearing \textit{Garmin--55} smartwatches over six months with over 15 million minutes. We develop a hierarchical deep learning approach that achieves 93.8% accuracy in temporal splits and 83.8% in cross-user evaluation. Our framework addresses missing data through physiologically-informed methods, reducing unknown sleep states from 40.38% to 3.66%. We demonstrate that while longer time windows (45-60 minutes) improve basic state classification, they present trade-offs in detecting fine-grained activities. Additionally, we introduce an intuitive visualization system that enables real-time comparison of individual performance against group metrics across multiple physiological indicators. This approach to activity recognition and performance monitoring provides military trainers with actionable insights for optimizing training programs and preventing injuries.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10572">Regularized Robustly Reliable Learners and Instance Targeted Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Avrim Blum, Donya Saless</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance-targeted data poisoning attacks, where an adversary corrupts a training set to induce errors on specific test points, have raised significant concerns. Balcan et al (2022) proposed an approach to addressing this challenge by defining a notion of robustly-reliable learners that provide per-instance guarantees of correctness under well-defined assumptions, even in the presence of data poisoning attacks. They then give a generic optimal (but computationally inefficient) robustly reliable learner as well as a computationally efficient algorithm for the case of linear separators over log-concave distributions.
  In this work, we address two challenges left open by Balcan et al (2022). The first is that the definition of robustly-reliable learners in Balcan et al (2022) becomes vacuous for highly-flexible hypothesis classes: if there are two classifiers h_0, h_1 \in H both with zero error on the training set such that h_0(x) \neq h_1(x), then a robustly-reliable learner must abstain on x. We address this problem by defining a modified notion of regularized robustly-reliable learners that allows for nontrivial statements in this case. The second is that the generic algorithm of Balcan et al (2022) requires re-running an ERM oracle (essentially, retraining the classifier) on each test point x, which is generally impractical even if ERM can be implemented efficiently. To tackle this problem, we show that at least in certain interesting cases we can design algorithms that can produce their outputs in time sublinear in training time, by using techniques from dynamic algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyang Li, Caesar Wu, Mohammed Chadli, Said Mammar, Pascal Bouvry</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) uses multiple nodes to accelerate training, enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a key optimization algorithm, plays a central role in this process. However, communication bottlenecks often limit scalability and efficiency, leading to increasing adoption of compressed SGD techniques to alleviate these challenges. Despite addressing communication overheads, compressed SGD introduces trustworthiness concerns, as gradient exchanges among nodes are vulnerable to attacks like gradient inversion (GradInv) and membership inference attacks (MIA). The trustworthiness of compressed SGD remains unexplored, leaving important questions about its reliability unanswered.
  In this paper, we provide a trustworthiness evaluation of compressed versus uncompressed SGD. Specifically, we conducted empirical studies using GradInv attacks, revealing that compressed SGD demonstrates significantly higher resistance to privacy leakage compared to uncompressed SGD. In addition, our findings suggest that MIA may not be a reliable metric for assessing privacy risks in distributed learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We discuss several aspects of the loss landscape of regularized neural networks: the structure of stationary points, connectivity of optimal solutions, path with nonincreasing loss to arbitrary global optimum, and the nonuniqueness of optimal solutions, by casting the problem into an equivalent convex problem and considering its dual. Starting from two-layer neural networks with scalar output, we first characterize the solution set of the convex problem using its dual and further characterize all stationary points. With the characterization, we show that the topology of the global optima goes through a phase transition as the width of the network changes, and construct counterexamples where the problem may have a continuum of optimal solutions. Finally, we show that the solution set characterization and connectivity results can be extended to different architectures, including two-layer vector-valued neural networks and parallel three-layer neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Seismic data is often sparse and unevenly distributed due to the high costs and logistical challenges associated with deploying physical seismometers, limiting the application of Machine Learning (ML) in earthquake analysis. While simulation methods exist, no tool allows the generation of large datasets containing simulated measurements of the ground motion. To address this gap, we introduce PyAWD, a Python library designed to generate high-resolution synthetic datasets simulating spatio-temporal acoustic wave propagation in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional heterogeneous media. By allowing fine control over parameters such as the wave speed, external forces, spatial and temporal discretization, and media composition, PyAWD enables the creation of ML-scale datasets that capture the complexity of seismic wave behavior. We illustrate the library's potential with an epicenter retrieval task, showcasing its suitability for designing complex, accurate seismic problems that require advanced ML approaches in the absence or lack of dense real-world data. We also show the usefulness of our tool to tackle the problem of data budgeting in the framework of epicenter retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejumade Afonja, Hui-Po Wang, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose DP-2Stage, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihang Chen, Cheng Yang, Jie Ren, Zhiqiang Li, Zheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-life deployment of federated Learning (FL) often faces non-IID data, which leads to poor accuracy and slow convergence. Personalized FL (pFL) tackles these issues by tailoring local models to individual data sources and using weighted aggregation methods for client-specific learning. However, existing pFL methods often fail to provide each local model with global knowledge on demand while maintaining low computational overhead. Additionally, local models tend to over-personalize their data during the training process, potentially dropping previously acquired global information. We propose FLAYER, a novel layer-wise learning method for pFL that optimizes local model personalization performance. FLAYER considers the different roles and learning abilities of neural network layers of individual local models. It incorporates global information for each local model as needed to initialize the local model cost-effectively. It then dynamically adjusts learning rates for each layer during local training, optimizing the personalized learning process for each local model while preserving global knowledge. Additionally, to enhance global representation in pFL, FLAYER selectively uploads parameters for global aggregation in a layer-wise manner. We evaluate FLAYER on four representative datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains. Compared to six state-of-the-art pFL methods, FLAYER improves the inference accuracy, on average, by 5.40\% (up to 14.29\%).</p>

<p>Abstract: While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. In response to this challenge, we take inspiration from recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets) and propose a reinforcement learning method for diffusion model finetuning, dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients for probabilistic diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumanth Kumar Boya, Deepak Subramani</p>
<p>Abstract: Initial boundary value problems arise commonly in applications with engineering and natural systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these equations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional input and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a combination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals (physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the requirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity for a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a physics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently generalizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a simulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in our new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using cross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an initial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient learning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is applied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering applications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the relative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen initial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading physics informed operator learning methods. Moreover, our PINTO model is able to accurately solve the advection and Burgers equations at time steps that are not included in the training collocation points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinkai Wang, Xiaohui Chen, Liping Liu, Soha Hassoun</p>
<p>Abstract: The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the "dark chemical space" without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Mahdi B. Azad, Zahra Padar, Gabriel Kalweit, Joschka Boedecker</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate forecasting of contagious diseases is critical for public health policymaking and pandemic preparedness. We propose a new infectious disease forecasting model based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an emerging scientific machine learning approach. By embedding a compartmental model into the loss function, our method integrates epidemiological theory with data, helping to prevent model overfitting. We further enhance the model with a sub-network that accounts for covariates such as mobility and cumulative vaccine doses, which influence the transmission rate. Using state-level COVID-19 data from California, we demonstrate that the PINN model accurately predicts cases, deaths, and hospitalizations, aligning well with existing benchmarks. Notably, the PINN model outperforms naive baseline forecasts and several sequence deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Transformers. It also achieves performance comparable to a sophisticated Gaussian infection state forecasting model that combines compartmental dynamics, a data observation model, and parameter regression. However, the PINN model features a simpler structure and is easier to implement. In summary, we systematically evaluate the PINN model's ability to forecast infectious disease dynamics, demonstrating its potential as an efficient computational tool to strengthen forecasting capabilities.</p>

Our data-driven approach learns the distributions resulting from human preferences and scheduling logic without the need for complex interacting combinations of sub-models and custom rules, This makes our approach significantly faster and simpler to operate than existing approaches to synthesise or anonymise schedule data. We additionally contribute a novel schedule representation and a comprehensive evaluation framework. We evaluate a range of schedule encoding and deep model architecture combinations. The evaluation shows our approach can rapidly generate large, diverse, novel, and realistic synthetic samples of activity schedules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Emily B. Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence models lie at the heart of modern deep learning. However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaddin Dughmi</p>
<p>Abstract: The main goal of this article is to convince you, the reader, that supervised learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model is closely related to -- of all things -- bipartite matching! En-route from PAC learning to bipartite matching, I will overview a particular transductive model of learning, and associated one-inclusion graphs, which can be viewed as a generalization of some of the hat puzzles that are popular in recreational mathematics. Whereas this transductive model is far from new, it has recently seen a resurgence of interest as a tool for tackling deep questions in learning theory. A secondary purpose of this article could be as a (biased) tutorial on the connections between the PAC and transductive models of learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwoo Kim, Joonhyung Lee, Gunho Park, Byeongwook Kim, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsoo Lee, Youngjoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their inference demands present significant challenges, particularly due to the high power consumption of AI accelerators in datacenters. These facilities require specialized cooling and power management systems, substantially increasing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for cloud service providers (CSPs). In this work, we analyze the computational characteristics and constraints of LLM inference from a TCO perspective, focusing on two representative accelerators: the Gaudi 2 and NVIDIA H100. We present a generalizable framework that enables CSPs to compare and select AI accelerators according to diverse operational requirements. Using this model, we analyze the impact of FP8 precision and LLM inference workload characteristics as key factors influencing TCO. We investigate FP8 quantization, which is gaining adoption in LLM training, as a technique to improve inference throughput while maintaining cost efficiency. Furthermore, our analysis of LLM inference workloads reveals that performance on thin GEMMs, which dominate the decode phase, can have a greater impact than theoretical hardware peak performance. By studying the interaction between power consumption, quantization strategies, and hardware architecture, we offer insights that support informed deployment decisions and guide future accelerator designs to improve the TCO of LLM inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhekai Du, Yinjie Min, Jingjing Li, Ke Lu, Changliang Zou, Liuhua Peng, Tingjin Chu, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a prevalent method for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. However, the simple low-rank decomposition form may constrain the hypothesis space. To address this limitation, we introduce Location-aware Cosine Adaptation (LoCA), a novel frequency-domain parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (iDCT) with selective locations of learnable components. We begin with a comprehensive theoretical comparison between frequency-domain and low-rank decompositions for fine-tuning pre-trained large models. Our analysis reveals that frequency-domain decomposition with carefully selected frequency components can surpass the expressivity of traditional low-rank-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that iDCT offers a more efficient implementation compared to inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (iDFT), allowing for better selection and tuning of frequency components while maintaining equivalent expressivity to the optimal iDFT-based adaptation. By employing finite-difference approximation to estimate gradients for discrete locations of learnable coefficients on the DCT spectrum, LoCA dynamically selects the most informative frequency components during training. Experiments on diverse language and vision fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that LoCA offers enhanced parameter efficiency while maintains computational feasibility comparable to low-rank-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingkai Xu, Yongpeng Wu, Yuxuan Shi, Xiang-Gen Xia, Wenjun Zhang, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: A latent denoising semantic communication (SemCom) framework is proposed for robust image transmission over noisy channels. By incorporating a learnable latent denoiser into the receiver, the received signals are preprocessed to effectively remove the channel noise and recover the semantic information, thereby enhancing the quality of the decoded images. Specifically, a latent denoising mapping is established by an iterative residual learning approach to improve the denoising efficiency while ensuring stable performance. Moreover, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is utilized to estimate and predict the latent similarity score (SS) for conditional denoising, where the number of denoising steps is adapted based on the predicted SS sequence, further reducing the communication latency. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively and efficiently remove the channel noise at various levels and reconstruct visual-appealing images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvind Pillai, Dimitris Spathis, Subigya Nepal, Amanda C Collins, Daniel M Mackin, Michael V Heinz, Tess Z Griffin, Nicholas C Jacobson, Andrew Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Zamboni, Mirco Mutti, Marcello Restelli</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to task-agnostic exploration when we aim to explore the environment without access to the task specification a priori. In a single-agent setting the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach cast the task-agnostic objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follows. In contrast, little is known about task-agnostic exploration in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. How should different agents explore in the presence of others? In this paper, we address this question through a generalization to multiple agents of the problem of maximizing the state distribution entropy. First, we investigate alternative formulations, highlighting respective positives and negatives. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide proof of concept experiments to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for task-agnostic exploration in challenging multi-agent settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aircraft manufacturing is the jewel in the crown of industry, among which generating high-fidelity airfoil geometries with controllable and editable representations remains a fundamental challenge. While existing deep-learning-based methods rely on predefined parametric function families, e.g., B\'ezier curves and discrete point-based representations, they suffer from inherent trade-offs between expressiveness and resolution flexibility. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FuncGenFoil, a novel function-space generative model that directly learns functional airfoil geometries. Our method inherits both the advantages of arbitrary resolution sampling and the smoothness of parametric functions, as well as the strong expressiveness of discrete point-based functions. Empirical evaluations on the AFBench dataset demonstrate that FuncGenFoil improves upon state-of-the-art methods in airfoil generation by achieving a relative -74.4 label error reduction and +23.2 diversity increase on the AF-200K dataset. Our results highlight the advantages of function-space modeling for aerodynamic shape optimization, offering a powerful and flexible framework for high-fidelity airfoil design. Our code will be released.</p>

Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DRL over traditional scheduling algorithms, particularly in managing complex task allocation, dynamic workloads, and multiple resource constraints.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Wang, Xiao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid expansion of cloud computing infrastructure, energy consumption has become a critical challenge, driving the need for accurate and efficient prediction models. This study proposes a novel Vector Weighted Average Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (VWAA-KELM) model to enhance energy consumption prediction in cloud computing environments. By integrating a vector weighted average algorithm (VWAA) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), the proposed model dynamically adjusts feature weights and optimizes kernel functions, significantly improving prediction accuracy and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of VWAA-KELM: 94.7% of test set prediction errors fall within [0, 50] units, with only three cases exceeding 100 units, indicating strong stability. The model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.987 in the training set (RMSE = 28.108, RPD = 8.872) and maintains excellent generalization with R2 = 0.973 in the test set (RMSE = 43.227, RPD = 6.202). Visual analysis confirms that predicted values closely align with actual energy consumption trends, avoiding overfitting while capturing nonlinear dependencies. A key innovation of this study is the introduction of adaptive feature weighting, allowing the model to dynamically assign importance to different input parameters, thereby enhancing high-dimensional data processing. This advancement provides a scalable and efficient approach for optimizing cloud data center energy consumption. Beyond cloud computing, the proposed hybrid framework has broader applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, supporting real-time energy management and intelligent resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak, Roberto Pellungrini, Salvatore Rinzivillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well adopted paradigm of decentralized learning that allows training one model from multiple sources without the need to directly transfer data between participating clients. Since its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous sub-fields that deal with application-specific issues, be it data heterogeneity or resource allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), is dealing with the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to deliver personalized models. Although few remarkable works have been published in this domain, the problem is still largely unexplored, as its basic assumption and settings are slightly different from standard FL. In this work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on the computation of cosine similarity between gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over thirty different tasks on three benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal performance impact. However, existing methods often suffer from performance loss without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Further experiments indicate our proposed method is orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, where Wanda++ can be combined with LoRA fine-tuning to achieve a similar perplexity improvement as the Wanda method. The proposed method is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Thomas, Deepti Ghadiyaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization aims to develop models that can generalize to novel and unseen data distributions. In this work, we study how model architectures and pre-training objectives impact feature richness and propose a method to effectively leverage them for domain generalization. Specifically, given a pre-trained feature space, we first discover latent domain structures, referred to as pseudo-domains, that capture domain-specific variations in an unsupervised manner. Next, we augment existing classifiers with these complementary pseudo-domain representations making them more amenable to diverse unseen test domains. We analyze how different pre-training feature spaces differ in the domain-specific variances they capture. Our empirical studies reveal that features from diffusion models excel at separating domains in the absence of explicit domain labels and capture nuanced domain-specific information. On 5 datasets, we show that our very simple framework improves generalization to unseen domains by a maximum test accuracy improvement of over 4% compared to the standard baseline Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Crucially, our method outperforms most algorithms that access domain labels during training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have recently transformed hardware design, yet bridging the gap between code synthesis and PPA (power, performance, and area) estimation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a 21k dataset of thoroughly cleaned and synthesizable Verilog modules, each annotated with detailed power, delay, and area metrics. By employing chain-of-thought techniques, we automatically debug and curate this dataset to ensure high fidelity in downstream applications. We then fine-tune CodeLlama using LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods, framing the task as a regression problem to accurately predict PPA metrics from Verilog code. Furthermore, we augment our approach with a mixture-of-experts architecture-integrating both LoRA and an additional MLP expert layer-to further refine predictions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: power estimation accuracy is enhanced by 5.9% at a 20% error threshold and by 7.2% at a 10% threshold, delay estimation improves by 5.1% and 3.9%, and area estimation sees gains of 4% and 7.9% for the 20% and 10% thresholds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of the mixture-of-experts module contributes an additional 3--4% improvement across these tasks. Our results establish a new benchmark for PPA-aware Verilog generation, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated dataset and modeling strategies for next-generation EDA workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangtao Sun, Xiang Cheng, Xing Yu, Haotian Xu, Zhao Yang, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed the uncertain reward models to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, and thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that can directly learn the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM effectively models the rewards and uncertainties, and significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance compared with existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uddhav Bhattarai, Rajkishan Arikapudi, Steven A. Fennimore, Frank N Martin, Stavros G. Vougioukas</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual fruit harvesting is common in agriculture, but the amount of time pickers spend on non-productive activities can make it very inefficient. Accurately identifying picking vs. non-picking activity is crucial for estimating picker efficiency and optimising labour management and harvest processes. In this study, a practical system was developed to calculate the efficiency of pickers in commercial strawberry harvesting. Instrumented picking carts were developed to record the harvested fruit weight, geolocation, and cart movement in real time. These carts were deployed during the commercial strawberry harvest season in Santa Maria, CA. The collected data was then used to train a CNN-LSTM-based deep neural network to classify a picker's activity into "Pick" and "NoPick" classes. Experimental evaluations showed that the CNN-LSTM model showed promising activity recognition performance with an F1 score accuracy of over 0.97. The recognition results were then used to compute picker efficiency and the time required to fill a tray. Analysis of the season-long harvest data showed that the average picker efficiency was 75.07% with an estimation accuracy of 95.22%. Furthermore, the average tray fill time was 6.79 minutes with an estimation accuracy of 96.43%. When integrated into commercial harvesting, the proposed technology can aid growers in monitoring automated worker activity and optimising harvests to reduce non-productive time and enhance overall harvest efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isma\"el Zighed, Nicolas Thome, Patrick Gallinari, Taraneh Sayadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichao Cai, Yuhang Liu, Erdun Gao, Tianjiao Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Anton van den Hengel, Javen Qinfeng Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal representation learning, exemplified by multimodal contrastive learning (MMCL) using image-text pairs, aims to learn powerful representations by aligning cues across modalities. This approach relies on the core assumption that the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an identical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world datasets often exhibit misalignment. There are two distinct viewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the misalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these seemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for practitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize misalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: selection bias, where some semantic variables are missing, and perturbation bias, where semantic variables are distorted -- both affecting latent variables shared across modalities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the representations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the subset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation biases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment. Based on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment should inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical findings through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real image-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of misalignment on multimodal representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinye Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamically optimizing numerical precision in the preconditioned conjugate gradient (CG) method. By modeling precision selection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we employ Q-learning to adaptively assign precision levels to key operations, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy, while ensuring stability through double-precision scalar computations and residual computing. In practice, the algorithm is trained on a set of data and subsequently performs inference for precision selection on out-of-sample data, without requiring re-analysis or retraining for new datasets. This enables the method to adapt seamlessly to new problem instances without the computational overhead of recalibration. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in enhancing solver's performance, marking the first application of RL to mixed-precision numerical methods. The findings highlight the approach's practical advantages, robustness, and scalability, providing valuable insights into its integration with iterative solvers and paving the way for AI-driven advancements in scientific computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> AJ Miller, Fangzhou Yu, Michael Brauckmann, Farbod Farshidian</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents an overview of the technical details behind a high performance reinforcement learning policy deployment with the Spot RL Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot. This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces, disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low level API.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao An, Huajun Bai, Ziqiong Liu, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our optimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x, achieving 311.5 tokens per second.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\'ulia Vicens Figueres, Juliette Vanderhaeghen, Federica Bragone, Kateryna Morozovska, Khemraj Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Debole, Pietro Barbiero, Francesco Giannini, Andrea Passerini, Stefano Teso, Emanuele Marconato</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are neural networks designed to conjoin high performance with ante-hoc interpretability. CBMs work by first mapping inputs (e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing "VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that, depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyuan Wang, Jiachen Chen, Kathryn L. Lunetta, Danyang Huang, Huimin Cheng, Debarghya Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning enhances model performance by utilizing knowledge from related domains, particularly when labeled data is scarce. While existing research addresses transfer learning under various distribution shifts in independent settings, handling dependencies in networked data remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a high-dimensional transfer learning framework based on network convolutional regression (NCR), inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The NCR model incorporates random network structure by allowing each node's response to depend on its features and the aggregated features of its neighbors, capturing local dependencies effectively. Our methodology includes a two-step transfer learning algorithm that addresses domain shift between source and target networks, along with a source detection mechanism to identify informative domains. Theoretically, we analyze the lasso estimator in the context of a random graph based on the Erdos-Renyi model assumption, demonstrating that transfer learning improves convergence rates when informative sources are present. Empirical evaluations, including simulations and a real-world application using Sina Weibo data, demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly when labeled data in the target domain is limited.</p>

Applications include, for example, the control of a large number of robots communicating through a central unit dispatching the optimal policy computed by maximizing an aggregate reward. An approximate solution is obtained by learning the optimal policy of a generic agent interacting with the statistical distribution of the states and actions of the other agents. We first provide a full analysis this discrete-time mean field control problem. We then rigorously prove the convergence of exact and model-free policy gradient methods in a mean-field linear-quadratic setting and establish bounds on the rates of convergence. We also provide graphical evidence of the convergence based on implementations of our algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micha{\l} Derezi\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Stochastic variance reduction has proven effective at accelerating first-order algorithms for solving convex finite-sum optimization tasks such as empirical risk minimization. Incorporating second-order information has proven helpful in further improving the performance of these first-order methods. Yet, comparatively little is known about the benefits of using variance reduction to accelerate popular stochastic second-order methods such as Subsampled Newton. To address this, we propose Stochastic Variance-Reduced Newton (SVRN), a finite-sum minimization algorithm that provably accelerates existing stochastic Newton methods from $O(\alpha\log(1/\epsilon))$ to $O\big(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log(n)}\big)$ passes over the data, i.e., by a factor of $O(\alpha\log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of sum components and $\alpha$ is the approximation factor in the Hessian estimate. Surprisingly, this acceleration gets more significant the larger the data size $n$, which is a unique property of SVRN. Our algorithm retains the key advantages of Newton-type methods, such as easily parallelizable large-batch operations and a simple unit step size. We use SVRN to accelerate Subsampled Newton and Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithms, and show that it compares favorably to popular first-order methods with variance~reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Yu, Xuecheng Ouyang, Zhenwei Shao, Meng Wang, Jun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires external knowledge beyond the image to answer the question. Early studies retrieve required knowledge from explicit knowledge bases (KBs), which often introduces irrelevant information to the question, hence restricting the performance of their models. Recent works have resorted to using a powerful large language model (LLM) as an implicit knowledge engine to acquire the necessary knowledge for answering. Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, we argue that they have not fully activated the capacity of the \emph{blind} LLM as the provided textual input is insufficient to depict the required visual information to answer the question. In this paper, we present Prophet -- a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework designed to prompt LLM with answer heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, we first train a vanilla VQA model on a specific knowledge-based VQA dataset without external knowledge. After that, we extract two types of complementary answer heuristics from the VQA model: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. The two types of answer heuristics are jointly encoded into a formatted prompt to facilitate the LLM's understanding of both the image and question, thus generating a more accurate answer. By incorporating the state-of-the-art LLM GPT-3, Prophet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on four challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets. Prophet is general that can be instantiated with the combinations of different VQA models (i.e., both discriminative and generative ones) and different LLMs (i.e., both commercial and open-source ones). Moreover, Prophet can also be integrated with modern large multimodal models in different stages, which is named Prophet++, to further improve the capabilities on knowledge-based VQA tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09310">The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Emadaldin Mozafari-Majd, Visa Koivunen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or match the best performances of competing regularized estimators, with minimal or no loss in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy for almost all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the past decade, deep learning became the prevalent methodology for predictive modeling thanks to the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the structure of neural networks converged back to simpler representations based on piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which became the most commonly used type of activation function in neural networks. That made certain types of network structure $\unicode{x2014}$such as the typical fully-connected feedforward neural network$\unicode{x2014}$ amenable to analysis through polyhedral theory and to the application of methodologies such as Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for a variety of purposes. In this paper, we survey the main topics emerging from this fast-paced area of work, which bring a fresh perspective to understanding neural networks in more detail as well as to applying linear optimization techniques to train, verify, and reduce the size of such networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phai Vu Dinh, Quang Uy Nguyen, Thai Hoang Dinh, Diep N. Nguyen, Bao Son Pham, Eryk Dutkiewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning (RL) methods for cyberattack detection face the diversity and sophistication of attack data, leading to the issue of mixed representations of different classes, particularly as the number of classes increases. To address this, the paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture/model called the Twin Auto-Encoder (TAE). TAE first maps the input data into latent space and then deterministically shifts data samples of different classes further apart to create separable data representations, referred to as representation targets. TAE's decoder then projects the input data into these representation targets. After training, TAE's decoder extracts data representations. TAE's representation target serves as a novel dynamic codeword, which refers to the vector that represents a specific class. This vector is updated after each training epoch for every data sample, in contrast to the conventional fixed codeword that does not incorporate information from the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse cybersecurity datasets, including seven IoT botnet datasets, two network IDS datasets, three malware datasets, one cloud DDoS dataset, and ten artificial datasets as the number of classes increases. TAE boosts accuracy and F-score in attack detection by around 2% compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 96.1% average accuracy in IoT attack detection. Additionally, TAE is well-suited for cybersecurity applications and potentially for IoT systems, with a model size of approximately 1 MB and an average running time of around 2.6E-07 seconds for extracting a data sample.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingzhi Li, Junyu Liu, Hanrui Wang, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating & reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Liu, Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Briol</p>
<p>Abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing is often criticized for its lack of practical relevance: since ``all models are wrong'', the null hypothesis that the data conform to our model is ultimately always rejected as sample size grows. Despite this, probabilistic models are still used extensively, raising the more pertinent question of whether the model is \emph{good enough} for the task at hand. This question can be formalized as a robust goodness-of-fit testing problem by asking whether the data were generated from a distribution that is a mild perturbation of the model. In this paper, we show that existing kernel goodness-of-fit tests are not robust under common notions of robustness including both qualitative and quantitative robustness. We further show that robustification techniques using tilted kernels, while effective in the parameter estimation literature, are not sufficient to ensure both types of robustness in the testing setting. To address this, we propose the first robust kernel goodness-of-fit test, which resolves this open problem by using kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) balls. This framework encompasses many well-known perturbation models, such as Huber's contamination and density-band models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gold-standard sleep scoring is based on epoch-based assignment of sleep stages based on a combination of EEG, EOG and EMG signals. However, a polysomnographic recording consists of many other signals that could be used for sleep staging, including cardio-respiratory modalities. Leveraging this signal variety would offer important advantages, for example increasing reliability, resilience to signal loss, and application to long-term non-obtrusive recordings. We developed a deep generative model for automatic sleep staging from a plurality of sensors and any -arbitrary- combination thereof. We trained a score-based diffusion model using a dataset of 1947 expert-labelled overnight recordings with 36 different signals, and achieved zero-shot inference on any sensor set by leveraging a novel Bayesian factorization of the score function across the sensors. On single-channel EEG, the model reaches the performance limit in terms of polysomnography inter-rater agreement (5- class accuracy 85.6%, Cohen's kappa 0.791). Moreover, the method offers full flexibility to use any sensor set, for example finger photoplethysmography, nasal flow and thoracic respiratory movements, (5-class accuracy 79.0%, Cohen's kappa of 0.697), or even derivations very unconventional for sleep staging, such as tibialis and sternocleidomastoid EMG (5-class accuracy 71.0%, kappa 0.575). Additionally, we propose a novel interpretability metric in terms of information gain per sensor and show this is linearly correlated with classification performance. Finally, our model allows for post- hoc addition of entirely new sensor modalities by merely training a score estimator on the novel input instead of having to retrain from scratch on all inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakub Ko\v{r}enek, Pavel Sanda, Jaroslav Hlinka</p>
<p>Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasileios Vatellis</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era increasingly focused on green computing and explainable AI, revisiting traditional approaches in theoretical and phenomenological particle physics is paramount. This project evaluates various machine learning (ML) algorithms-including Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and XGBoost-alongside standard neural networks and a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for physics data analysis. We apply these techniques to a binary classification task that distinguishes the experimental viability of simulated scenarios based on Higgs observables and essential parameters. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to showcase the capabilities and computational efficiency of each model in binary classification tasks, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on integrating ML and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into physics research. In this study, XGBoost emerged as the preferred choice among the evaluated machine learning algorithms for its speed and effectiveness, especially in the initial stages of computation with limited datasets. However, while standard Neural Networks and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and adherence to physical laws, they require more computational time. These findings underscore the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model sophistication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Schiffer, Lucas Janson</p>
<p>Abstract: Many practical applications of online reinforcement learning require the satisfaction of safety constraints while learning about the unknown environment. In this work, we establish theoretical foundations for reinforcement learning with safety constraints by studying the canonical problem of Linear Quadratic Regulator learning with unknown dynamics, but with the additional constraint that the position must stay within a safe region for the entire trajectory with high probability. Our primary contribution is a general framework for studying stronger baselines of nonlinear controllers that are better suited for constrained problems than linear controllers. Due to the difficulty of analyzing non-linear controllers in a constrained problem, we focus on 1-dimensional state- and action- spaces, however we also discuss how we expect the high-level takeaways can generalize to higher dimensions. Using our framework, we show that for \emph{any} non-linear baseline satisfying natural assumptions, $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$-regret is possible when the noise distribution has sufficiently large support, and $\tilde{O}_T(T^{2/3})$-regret is possible for \emph{any} subgaussian noise distribution. In proving these results, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation bound for nonlinear controls which shows that enforcing safety in the presence of sufficient noise can provide ``free exploration'' that compensates for the added cost of uncertainty in safety-constrained control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu, Bowen Shi, Avi Caciularu, Idan Szpektor, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-document (MD) processing is crucial for LLMs to handle real-world tasks such as summarization and question-answering across large sets of documents. While LLMs have improved at processing long inputs, MD contexts still present unique difficulties, including management of inter-document dependencies, redundancy, and incoherent structures. To address this challenge, we introduce MDCure, a scalable and effective instruction data generation framework to enhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of pre-training or reliance on human-annotated data. MDCure generates high-quality synthetic MD instruction data over sets of articles via targeted prompts. We also introduce MDCureRM, a cost-effective, MD-specific reward model to score and filter generated data based on their training utility for MD settings. MDCure is compatible with open- and closed-source models in addition to policy optimization methods such as PPO, enabling even small open-source models to surpass proprietary LLMs as strong generators of high-quality MD instruction data without further data filtering. With MDCure, we fine-tune a wide variety of LLMs up to 70B parameters in size from the FlanT5, Qwen2, and LLAMA3.1 model families. Extensive evaluations on a wide range of MD and long-context benchmarks spanning various tasks and domains show MDCure consistently improves performance over pre-trained baselines and base models by up to 75.1%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Ngo Nguyen, Jay Barrett, Kwang-Sung Jun</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the \emph{value} of the largest mean among K distributions via samples from them (rather than estimating \emph{which} distribution has the largest mean), which arises from various machine learning tasks including Q-learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). While there have been a few proposed algorithms, their performance analyses have been limited to their biases rather than a precise error metric. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called HAVER (Head AVERaging) and analyze its mean squared error. Our analysis reveals that HAVER has a compelling performance in two respects. First, HAVER estimates the maximum mean as well as the oracle who knows the identity of the best distribution and reports its sample mean. Second, perhaps surprisingly, HAVER exhibits even better rates than this oracle when there are many distributions near the best one. Both of these improvements are the first of their kind in the literature, and we also prove that the naive algorithm that reports the largest empirical mean does not achieve these bounds. Finally, we confirm our theoretical findings via numerical experiments where we implement HAVER in bandit, Q-learning, and MCTS algorithms. In these experiments, HAVER consistently outperforms the baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across different applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kuhn, Soroosh Shafiee, Wolfram Wiesemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengwei Xu, Yuxuan Lu, Grant Schoenebeck, Yuqing Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the GEM (Generative Estimator for Mutual Information), an evaluation metric for assessing language generation by Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in generating informative judgments, without the need for a gold standard reference. GEM broadens the scenarios where we can benchmark LLM generation performance-from traditional ones, like machine translation and summarization, where gold standard references are readily available, to subjective tasks without clear gold standards, such as academic peer review.
  GEM uses a generative model to estimate mutual information between candidate and reference responses, without requiring the reference to be a gold standard. In experiments on a human-annotated dataset, GEM demonstrates competitive correlations with human scores compared to the state-of-the-art GPT-4o Examiner, and outperforms all other baselines. Additionally, GEM is more robust against strategic manipulations, such as rephrasing or elongation, which can artificially inflate scores under a GPT-4o Examiner.
  We also present GRE-bench (Generating Review Evaluation Benchmark) which evaluates LLMs based on how well they can generate high-quality peer reviews for academic research papers. Because GRE-bench is based upon GEM, it inherits its robustness properties. Additionally, GRE-bench circumvents data contamination problems (or data leakage) by using the continuous influx of new open-access research papers and peer reviews each year. We show GRE-bench results of various popular LLMs on their peer review capabilities using the ICLR2023 dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shabarish Chenakkod, Micha{\l} Derezi\'nski, Xiaoyu Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: An oblivious subspace embedding is a random $m\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ such that, for any $d$-dimensional subspace, with high probability $\Pi$ preserves the norms of all vectors in that subspace within a $1\pm\epsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an oblivious subspace embedding with the optimal dimension $m=\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ that has a near-optimal sparsity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ non-zero entries per column of $\Pi$. This is the first result to nearly match the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] in terms of the best sparsity attainable by an optimal oblivious subspace embedding, improving on a prior bound of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ non-zeros per column [Chenakkod et al., STOC 2024]. We further extend our approach to the non-oblivious setting, proposing a new family of Leverage Score Sparsified embeddings with Independent Columns, which yield faster runtimes for matrix approximation and regression tasks.
  In our analysis, we develop a new method which uses a decoupling argument together with the cumulant method for bounding the edge universality error of isotropic random matrices. To achieve near-optimal sparsity, we combine this general-purpose approach with new traces inequalities that leverage the specific structure of our subspace embedding construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongfan Liu, Hyoukjun Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is a fundamental component in augmented reality (AR), which requires low latency for real-time processing. However, preprocessing such as rectification and non-ML computations such as cost volume require significant amount of latency exceeding that of an ML model itself, which hinders the real-time processing required by AR. Therefore, we develop alternative approaches to the rectification and cost volume that consider ML acceleration (GPU and NPUs) in recent hardware. For pre-processing, we eliminate it by introducing homography matrix prediction network with a rectification positional encoding (RPE), which delivers both low latency and robustness to unrectified images. For cost volume, we replace it with a group-pointwise convolution-based operator and approximation of cosine similarity based on layernorm and dot product. Based on our approaches, we develop MultiHeadDepth (replacing cost volume) and HomoDepth (MultiHeadDepth + removing pre-processing) models. MultiHeadDepth provides 11.8-30.3% improvements in accuracy and 22.9-25.2% reduction in latency compared to a state-of-the-art depth estimation model for AR glasses from industry. HomoDepth, which can directly process unrectified images, reduces the end-to-end latency by 44.5%. We also introduce a multi-task learning method to handle misaligned stereo inputs on HomoDepth, which reduces the AbsRel error by 10.0-24.3%. The overall results demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches, which not only reduce the inference latency but also improve the model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenfan Qu, Yiwu Zhong, Fengjun Guo, Lianwen Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods mostly rely heavily on task-specific designs, making them perform well only on the target IML task, while joint training on multiple IML tasks causes significant performance degradation, hindering real applications.
  To this end, we propose Omni-IML, the first generalist model designed to unify IML across diverse tasks.
  Specifically, Omni-IML achieves generalization through three key components: (1) a Modal Gate Encoder, which adaptively selects the optimal encoding modality per sample, (2) a Dynamic Weight Decoder, which dynamically adjusts decoder filters to the task at hand, and (3) an Anomaly Enhancement module that leverages box supervision to highlight the tampered regions and facilitate the learning of task-agnostic features.
  Beyond localization, to support interpretation of the tampered images, we construct Omni-273k, a large high-quality dataset that includes natural language descriptions of tampered artifact. It is annotated through our automatic, chain-of-thoughts annotation technique.
  We also design a simple-yet-effective interpretation module to better utilize these descriptive annotations.
  Our extensive experiments show that our single Omni-IML model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four major IML tasks, providing a valuable solution for practical deployment and a promising direction of generalist models in image forensics. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Dutta, Nouhaila Innan, Sadok Ben Yahia, Muhammad Shafique, David Esteban Bernal Neira</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on linear regression models with non-conjugate sparsity-inducing regularizers such as lasso and group lasso. Although the empirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter, little is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many aspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of automatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this paper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized linear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the estimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD mechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD mechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the conditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianzhi Feng, Chennan Wu, Yi Niu, Fu Li, Yang Li, Boxun Fu, Zhifu Zhao, Xiaotian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies demonstrate that specific areas of the brain are connected to human emotional responses, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments conducted on SEED, SEED-IV and MPED datasets indicate that our method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The potato is a widely grown crop in many regions of the world. In recent decades, potato farming has gained incredible traction in the world. Potatoes are susceptible to several illnesses that stunt their development. This plant seems to have significant leaf disease. Early Blight and Late Blight are two prevalent leaf diseases that affect potato plants. The early detection of these diseases would be beneficial for enhancing the yield of this crop. The ideal solution is to use image processing to identify and analyze these disorders. Here, we present an autonomous method based on image processing and machine learning to detect late blight disease affecting potato leaves. The proposed method comprises four different phases: (1) Histogram Equalization is used to improve the quality of the input image; (2) feature extraction is performed using a Deep CNN model, then these extracted features are concatenated; (3) feature selection is performed using wrapper-based feature selection; (4) classification is performed using an SVM classifier and its variants. This proposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 99% using SVM by selecting 550 features.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing image editing models struggle to meet real-world demands. Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Chen, Yizhou Wang, Shixiang Tang, Qianhong Ma, Tong He, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaowei Zhou, Hujun Bao, Sida Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning an agent model behaving like humans, which can jointly perceive, predict, and act in egocentric worlds. Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, which prevents them from learning from each other. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions within a single transformer. EgoAgent introduces two innovations to learn from the causal and temporally intertwined nature of these abilities: (1) Interleaved sequential modeling of states and actions with the causal attention mechanism, and (2) A joint embedding-action-prediction architecture featuring temporal asymmetric predictor-observer branches. Integrating these designs based on JEPA, EgoAgent unifies these capabilities in a cohesive learning framework. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aoxiong Yin, Kai Shen, Yichong Leng, Xu Tan, Xinyu Zhou, Juncheng Li, Siliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have been driven by two competing paradigms: autoregressive language models and diffusion models. However, each paradigm has intrinsic limitations: language models struggle with visual quality and error accumulation, while diffusion models lack semantic understanding and causal modeling. In this work, we propose LanDiff, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of both paradigms through coarse-to-fine generation. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) a semantic tokenizer that compresses 3D visual features into compact 1D discrete representations through efficient semantic compression, achieving a $\sim$14,000$\times$ compression ratio; (2) a language model that generates semantic tokens with high-level semantic relationships; (3) a streaming diffusion model that refines coarse semantics into high-fidelity videos. Experiments show that LanDiff, a 5B model, achieves a score of 85.43 on the VBench T2V benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art open-source models Hunyuan Video (13B) and other commercial models such as Sora, Kling, and Hailuo. Furthermore, our model also achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation, surpassing other open-source models in this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiushuo Hou, Sangwoo Park, Matteo Zecchin, Yunlong Cai, Guanding Yu, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions. Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael D. White, Michael D. Atkinson, Adam J. Plowman, Pratheek Shanthraj</p>
<p>Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhao, Juzhan Xu, Kexiong Yu, Ruizhen Hu, Chenyang Zhu, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) has widespread applications in industrial automation. Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained placement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and efficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely 19 boxes per pallet with 57.4% space utilization for relatively large-size boxes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaroslav Gusev, Vitaly Vanchurin</p>
<p>Abstract: We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Manuel Aroca-Fernandez, Jose Francisco Diez-Pastor, Pedro Latorre-Carmona, Victor Elvira, Gustau Camps-Valls, Rodrigo Pascual, Cesar Garcia-Osorio</p>
<p>Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon sequestration, making it essential for sustainable land management and climate change mitigation. However, large-scale SOC monitoring remains challenging due to spatial variability, temporal dynamics, and multiple influencing factors. We present WALGREEN, a platform that enhances SOC inference by overcoming limitations of current applications. Leveraging machine learning and diverse soil samples, WALGREEN generates predictive models using historical public and private data. Built on cloud-based technologies, it offers a user-friendly interface for researchers, policymakers, and land managers to access carbon data, analyze trends, and support evidence-based decision-making. Implemented in Python, Java, and JavaScript, WALGREEN integrates Google Earth Engine and Sentinel Copernicus via scripting, OpenLayers, and Thymeleaf in a Model-View-Controller framework. This paper aims to advance soil science, promote sustainable agriculture, and drive critical ecosystem responses to climate change.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15388">Deep learning with missing data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Ma, Tengyao Wang, Richard J. Samworth</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates, we propose Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs), which can be applied in conjunction with any existing imputation technique. In addition to a neural network trained on the imputed data, PENNs pass the vectors of observation indicators through a second neural network to provide a compact representation. The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size. Numerical experiments on simulated, semi-synthetic and real data confirm that the PENN estimator consistently improves, often dramatically, on standard neural networks without pattern embedding. Code to reproduce our experiments, as well as a tutorial on how to apply our method, is publicly available.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16137">Virology Capabilities Test (VCT): A Multimodal Virology Q&amp;A Benchmark</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper G\"otting, Pedro Medeiros, Jon G Sanders, Nathaniel Li, Long Phan, Karam Elabd, Lennart Justen, Dan Hendrycks, Seth Donoughe</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erfan Loweimi, Mengjie Qian, Kate Knill, Mark Gales</p>
<p>Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive (spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges, possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems, establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19323">NSFlow: An End-to-End FPGA Framework with Scalable Dataflow Architecture for Neuro-Symbolic AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanchen Yang, Zishen Wan, Ritik Raj, Joongun Park, Ziwei Li, Ananda Samajdar, Arijit Raychowdhury, Tushar Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) is an emerging paradigm that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning to enhance the transparency, reasoning capabilities, and data efficiency of AI systems. Recent NSAI systems have gained traction due to their exceptional performance in reasoning tasks and human-AI collaborative scenarios. Despite these algorithmic advancements, executing NSAI tasks on existing hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) remains challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads. In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems. NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves 31x speedup over Jetson TX2, more than 2x over GPU, 8x speedup over TPU-like systolic array, and more than 3x over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates enhanced scalability, with only 4x runtime increase when symbolic workloads scale by 150x. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James O' Neill, Santhosh Subramanian, Eric Lin, Vaikkunth Mugunthan</p>
<p>Abstract: The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.
  In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art (SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy guardrail models. % On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created, our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA publicly available LLMs and 3$^{\text{rd}}$ party guardrail APIs in detecting unsafe and safe behaviors by an average F1 score improvement of \textbf{29.92} points over Aegis-LlamaGuard and \textbf{21.62} over \texttt{gpt-4o}, respectively.
