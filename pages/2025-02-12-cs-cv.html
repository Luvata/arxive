<p><b>Authors:</b> Namhee Kim, Woojin Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle with reasoning in complex, unexpected scenarios due to limited comprehension of spatial relationships. In response, this study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Autonomous Driving (AD) assistance system that integrates a vision adapter and an LLM reasoning module to enhance visual understanding and decision-making. The vision adapter, combining YOLOv4 and Vision Transformer (ViT), extracts comprehensive visual features, while GPT-4 enables human-like spatial reasoning and response generation. Experimental evaluations with 45 experienced drivers revealed that the system closely mirrors human performance in describing situations and moderately aligns with human decisions in generating appropriate responses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsiao-Yuan Chin, I-Chao Shen, Yi-Ting Chiu, Bing-Yu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Zhou, Shuichiro Miwa, Yang Liu, Koji Okamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: A generative AI architecture called bubbly flow generative adversarial networks (BF-GAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic and high-quality bubbly flow images through physically conditioned inputs, jg and jf. Initially, 52 sets of bubbly flow experiments under varying conditions are conducted to collect 140,000 bubbly flow images with physical labels of jg and jf for training data. A multi-scale loss function is then developed, incorporating mismatch loss and pixel loss to enhance the generative performance of BF-GAN further. Regarding evaluative metrics of generative AI, the BF-GAN has surpassed conventional GAN. Physically, key parameters of bubbly flow generated by BF-GAN are extracted and compared with measurement values and empirical correlations, validating BF-GAN's generative performance. The comparative analysis demonstrate that the BF-GAN can generate realistic and high-quality bubbly flow images with any given jg and jf within the research scope.
  BF-GAN offers a generative AI solution for two-phase flow research, substantially lowering the time and cost required to obtain high-quality data. In addition, it can function as a benchmark dataset generator for bubbly flow detection and segmentation algorithms, enhancing overall productivity in this research domain. The BF-GAN model is available online (https://github.com/zhouzhouwen/BF-GAN).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaibhav Mehra, Guy Laban, Hatice Gunes</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models primarily operate through text-based inputs and outputs, yet human emotion is communicated through both verbal and non-verbal cues, including facial expressions. While Vision-Language Models analyze facial expressions from images, they are resource-intensive and may depend more on linguistic priors than visual understanding. To address this, this study investigates whether LLMs can infer affective meaning from dimensions of facial expressions-Valence and Arousal values, structured numerical representations, rather than using raw visual input. VA values were extracted using Facechannel from images of facial expressions and provided to LLMs in two tasks: (1) categorizing facial expressions into basic (on the IIMI dataset) and complex emotions (on the Emotic dataset) and (2) generating semantic descriptions of facial expressions (on the Emotic dataset). Results from the categorization task indicate that LLMs struggle to classify VA values into discrete emotion categories, particularly for emotions beyond basic polarities (e.g., happiness, sadness). However, in the semantic description task, LLMs produced textual descriptions that align closely with human-generated interpretations, demonstrating a stronger capacity for free text affective inference of facial expressions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Santos, T\^ania Carvalho, Filipe Magalh\~aes, Lu\'is Antunes</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for privacy in visual data management grows, safeguarding sensitive information has become a critical challenge. This paper addresses the need for privacy-preserving solutions in large-scale visual data processing by leveraging federated learning. Although there have been developments in this field, previous research has mainly focused on integrating object detection with either anonymization or federated learning. However, these pairs often fail to address complex privacy concerns. On the one hand, object detection with anonymization alone can be vulnerable to reverse techniques. On the other hand, federated learning may not provide sufficient privacy guarantees. Therefore, we propose a new approach that combines object detection, federated learning and anonymization. Combining these three components aims to offer a robust privacy protection strategy by addressing different vulnerabilities in visual data. Our solution is evaluated against traditional centralized models, showing that while there is a slight trade-off in accuracy, the privacy benefits are substantial, making it well-suited for privacy sensitive applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jared D. T. Guerrero-Sosa, Andres Montoro-Montarroso, Francisco P. Romero, Jesus Serrano-Guerrero, Jose A. Olivas</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of the rapid dissemination of multimedia content, identifying disinformation on social media platforms such as TikTok represents a significant challenge. This study introduces a hybrid framework that combines the computational power of deep learning with the interpretability of fuzzy logic to detect suspected disinformation in TikTok videos. The methodology is comprised of two core components: a multimodal feature analyser that extracts and evaluates data from text, audio, and video; and a multimodal disinformation detector based on fuzzy logic. These systems operate in conjunction to evaluate the suspicion of spreading disinformation, drawing on human behavioural cues such as body language, speech patterns, and text coherence. Two experiments were conducted: one focusing on context-specific disinformation and the other on the scalability of the model across broader topics. For each video evaluated, high-quality, comprehensive, well-structured reports are generated, providing a detailed view of the disinformation behaviours.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David S. Bhatti, Yougin Choi, Rahman S M Wahidur, Maleeka Bakhtawar, Sumin Kim, Surin Lee, Yongtae Lee, Heung-No Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial and spectral data, enabling analysis of features invisible to conventional systems. The technology is vital in fields such as weather monitoring, food quality control, counterfeit detection, healthcare diagnostics, and extending into defense, agriculture, and industrial automation at the same time. HSI has advanced with improvements in spectral resolution, miniaturization, and computational methods. This study provides an overview of the HSI, its applications, challenges in data fusion and the role of deep learning models in processing HSI data. We discuss how integration of multimodal HSI with AI, particularly with deep learning, improves classification accuracy and operational efficiency. Deep learning enhances HSI analysis in areas like feature extraction, change detection, denoising unmixing, dimensionality reduction, landcover mapping, data augmentation, spectral construction and super resolution. An emerging focus is the fusion of hyperspectral cameras with large language models (LLMs), referred as highbrain LLMs, enabling the development of advanced applications such as low visibility crash detection and face antispoofing. We also highlight key players in HSI industry, its compound annual growth rate and the growing industrial significance. The purpose is to offer insight to both technical and non-technical audience, covering HSI's images, trends, and future directions, while providing valuable information on HSI datasets and software libraries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixing Lu, Junting Dong, Youngjoong Kwon, Qin Zhao, Bo Dai, Fernando De la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a generalizable and unified framework to synthesize view-consistent and temporally coherent avatars from a single image, addressing the challenging problem of single-image avatar generation. While recent methods employ diffusion models conditioned on human templates like depth or normal maps, they often struggle to preserve appearance information due to the discrepancy between sparse driving signals and the actual human subject, resulting in multi-view and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach bridges this gap by combining the reconstruction power of regression-based 3D human reconstruction with the generative capabilities of a diffusion model. The dense driving signal from the initial reconstructed human provides comprehensive conditioning, ensuring high-quality synthesis faithful to the reference appearance and structure. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that enables the generalization learned from novel pose synthesis on in-the-wild videos to naturally transfer to novel view synthesis. Our video-based diffusion model enhances disentangled synthesis with high-quality view-consistent renderings for novel views and realistic non-rigid deformations in novel pose animation. Results demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method across in-domain and out-of-domain in-the-wild datasets. Project page: https://humansensinglab.github.io/GAS/</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel application for directly estimating indoor light and heat maps from captured indoor-outdoor High Dynamic Range (HDR) panoramas. In our image-based rendering method, the indoor panorama is used to estimate the 3D room layout, while the corresponding outdoor panorama serves as an environment map to infer spatially-varying light and material properties. We establish a connection between indoor light transport and heat transport and implement transient heat simulation to generate indoor heat panoramas. The sensitivity analysis of various thermal parameters is conducted, and the resulting heat maps are compared with the images captured by the thermal camera in real-world scenarios. This digital application enables automatic indoor light and heat estimation without manual inputs and cumbersome field measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro V\'elez, Luisa F. Polan\'ia, Yi Yang, Chuhan Zhang, Rishab Kabra, Anurag Arnab, Mehdi S. M. Sajjadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling unprecedented realism in image and video synthesis. This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Berton, Alex Stoken, Carlo Masone</p>
<p>Abstract: Astronauts take thousands of photos of Earth per day from the International Space Station, which, once localized on Earth's surface, are used for a multitude of tasks, ranging from climate change research to disaster management. The localization process, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two losses: astronaut photos paired with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography via unsupervised mining. We find that AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, pushing the limits of existing datasets with a recall@100 consistently over 99%. Finally, we note that AstroLoc, without any fine-tuning, provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siwei Meng, Yawei Luo, Ping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-generated content have significantly improved the realism of 3D and 4D generation. However, most existing methods prioritize appearance consistency while neglecting underlying physical principles, leading to artifacts such as unrealistic deformations, unstable dynamics, and implausible objects interactions. Incorporating physics priors into generative models has become a crucial research direction to enhance structural integrity and motion realism. This survey provides a review of physics-aware generative methods, systematically analyzing how physical constraints are integrated into 3D and 4D generation. First, we examine recent works in incorporating physical priors into static and dynamic 3D generation, categorizing methods based on representation types, including vision-based, NeRF-based, and Gaussian Splatting-based approaches. Second, we explore emerging techniques in 4D generation, focusing on methods that model temporal dynamics with physical simulations. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of major methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different materials and motion dynamics. By presenting an in-depth analysis of physics-grounded AIGC, this survey aims to bridge the gap between generative models and physical realism, providing insights that inspire future research in physically consistent content generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Sharma, Maria Vannucci, Leonardo Pestana Legori, Mario Scaglia, Giovanni Guglielmo Laracca, Didier Mutter, Sergio Alfieri, Pietro Mascagni, Nicolas Padoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) operative difficulty (LCOD) is highly variable and influences outcomes. Despite extensive LC studies in surgical workflow analysis, limited efforts explore LCOD using intraoperative video data. Early recog- nition of LCOD could allow prompt review by expert surgeons, enhance operating room (OR) planning, and improve surgical outcomes.
  Methods: We propose the clinical task of early LCOD assessment using limited video observations. We design SurgPrOD, a deep learning model to assess LCOD by analyzing features from global and local temporal resolutions (snapshots) of the observed LC video. Also, we propose a novel snapshot-centric attention (SCA) module, acting across snapshots, to enhance LCOD prediction. We introduce the CholeScore dataset, featuring video-level LCOD labels to validate our method.
  Results: We evaluate SurgPrOD on 3 LCOD assessment scales in the CholeScore dataset. On our new metric assessing early and stable correct predictions, SurgPrOD surpasses baselines by at least 0.22 points. SurgPrOD improves over baselines by at least 9 and 5 percentage points in F1 score and top1-accuracy, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in correct predictions.
  Conclusion: We propose a new task for early LCOD assessment and a novel model, SurgPrOD analyzing surgical video from global and local perspectives. Our results on the CholeScore dataset establishes a new benchmark to study LCOD using intraoperative video data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present PrismAvatar: a 3D head avatar model which is designed specifically to enable real-time animation and rendering on resource-constrained edge devices, while still enjoying the benefits of neural volumetric rendering at training time. By integrating a rigged prism lattice with a 3D morphable head model, we use a hybrid rendering model to simultaneously reconstruct a mesh-based head and a deformable NeRF model for regions not represented by the 3DMM. We then distill the deformable NeRF into a rigged mesh and neural textures, which can be animated and rendered efficiently within the constraints of the traditional triangle rendering pipeline. In addition to running at 60 fps with low memory usage on mobile devices, we find that our trained models have comparable quality to state-of-the-art 3D avatar models on desktop devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmentation of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors in 3D medical imaging is both complex and clinically critical, providing vital support for effective radiation therapy planning and survival outcome assessment. Recently, 3D volumetric segmentation architectures incorporating long-range sequence modeling mechanisms, such as Transformers and Mamba, have gained attention for their capacity to achieve high accuracy in 3D medical image segmentation. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of these global token modeling techniques by pitting them against our proposed MambaOutUNet within the context of our newly introduced colorectal tumor segmentation dataset (CTS-204). Our findings suggest that robust local token interactions can outperform long-range modeling techniques in cases where the region of interest is small and anatomically complex, proposing a potential shift in 3D tumor segmentation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blake A Myers, Matthew Q Hill, Veda Nandan Gandi, Thomas M Metz, Alice J O'Toole</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents an investigation of four distinct approaches to long-term person identification using body shape. Unlike short-term re-identification systems that rely on temporary features (e.g., clothing), we focus on learning persistent body shape characteristics that remain stable over time. We introduce a body identification model based on a Vision Transformer (ViT) (Body Identification from Diverse Datasets, BIDDS) and on a Swin-ViT model (Swin-BIDDS). We also expand on previous approaches based on the Linguistic and Non-linguistic Core ResNet Identity Models (LCRIM and NLCRIM), but with improved training. All models are trained on a large and diverse dataset of over 1.9 million images of approximately 5k identities across 9 databases. Performance was evaluated on standard re-identification benchmark datasets (MARS, MSMT17, Outdoor Gait, DeepChange) and on an unconstrained dataset that includes images at a distance (from close-range to 1000m), at altitude (from an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV), and with clothing change. A comparative analysis across these models provides insights into how different backbone architectures and input image sizes impact long-term body identification performance across real-world conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Girish A. Koushik, Diptesh Kanojia, Helen Treharne</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms enable the propagation of hateful content across different modalities such as textual, auditory, and visual, necessitating effective detection methods. While recent approaches have shown promise in handling individual modalities, their effectiveness across different modality combinations remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of fusion-based approaches for multimodal hate detection, focusing on their performance across video and image-based content. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant modality-specific limitations: while simple embedding fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on video content (HateMM dataset) with a 9.9% points F1-score improvement, it struggles with complex image-text relationships in memes (Hateful Memes dataset). Through detailed ablation studies and error analysis, we demonstrate how current fusion approaches fail to capture nuanced cross-modal interactions, particularly in cases involving benign confounders. Our findings provide crucial insights for developing more robust hate detection systems and highlight the need for modality-specific architectural considerations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian li, Victoria Fern\`andez Abrevaya, Franck Multon, Adnane Boukhayma</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a method for recovering the shape and radiance of a scene consisting of multiple people given solely a few images. Multi-human scenes are complex due to additional occlusion and clutter. For single-human settings, existing approaches using implicit neural representations have achieved impressive results that deliver accurate geometry and appearance. However, it remains challenging to extend these methods for estimating multiple humans from sparse views. We propose a neural implicit reconstruction method that addresses the inherent challenges of this task through the following contributions: First, we propose to use geometry constraints by exploiting pre-computed meshes using a human body model (SMPL). Specifically, we regularize the signed distances using the SMPL mesh and leverage bounding boxes for improved rendering. Second, we propose a ray regularization scheme to minimize rendering inconsistencies, and a saturation regularization for robust optimization in variable illumination. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach and show state-of-the-art performance against existing neural reconstruction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krithika Iyer, Mokshagna Sai Teja Karanam, Shireen Elhabian</p>
<p>Abstract: Anatomy evaluation is crucial for understanding the physiological state, diagnosing abnormalities, and guiding medical interventions. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is vital in this process. By enabling the extraction of quantitative morphological shape descriptors from MRI and CT scans, SSM provides comprehensive descriptions of anatomical variations within a population. However, the effectiveness of SSM in anatomy evaluation hinges on the quality and robustness of the shape models. While deep learning techniques show promise in addressing these challenges by learning complex nonlinear representations of shapes, existing models still have limitations and often require pre-established shape models for training. To overcome these issues, we propose Mesh2SSM++, a novel approach that learns to estimate correspondences from meshes in an unsupervised manner. This method leverages unsupervised, permutation-invariant representation learning to estimate how to deform a template point cloud into subject-specific meshes, forming a correspondence-based shape model. Additionally, our probabilistic formulation allows learning a population-specific template, reducing potential biases associated with template selection. A key feature of Mesh2SSM++ is its ability to quantify aleatoric uncertainty, which captures inherent data variability and is essential for ensuring reliable model predictions and robust decision-making in clinical tasks, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Through extensive validation across diverse anatomies, evaluation metrics, and downstream tasks, we demonstrate that Mesh2SSM++ outperforms existing methods. Its ability to operate directly on meshes, combined with computational efficiency and interpretability through its probabilistic framework, makes it an attractive alternative to traditional and deep learning-based SSM approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Paul Cohen, Louis Blankemeier, Akshay Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations in medical imaging are critical for understanding the predictions made by deep learning models. We extend the Latent Shift counterfactual generation method from 2D applications to 3D computed tomography (CT) scans. We address the challenges associated with 3D data, such as limited training samples and high memory demands, by implementing a slice-based approach. This method leverages a 2D encoder trained on CT slices, which are subsequently combined to maintain 3D context. We demonstrate this technique on two models for clinical phenotype prediction and lung segmentation. Our approach is both memory-efficient and effective for generating interpretable counterfactuals in high-resolution 3D medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Lu, Yize Li, Yanzhi Wang, Wei Wang, Wei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image compression under ultra-low bitrates remains challenging for both conventional learned image compression (LIC) and generative vector-quantized (VQ) modeling. Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complimentary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving indices map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kehua Chen, Haoyang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has achieved remarkable results in the field of HMER (Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition). However, it remains challenging to improve performance with limited labeled training data. This paper presents, for the first time, a simple yet effective semi-supervised HMER framework by introducing dual-branch semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we simplify the conventional deep co-training from consistency regularization to cross-supervised learning, where the prediction of one branch is used as a pseudo-label to supervise the other branch directly end-to-end. Considering that the learning of the two branches tends to converge in the later stages of model optimization, we also incorporate a weak-to-strong strategy by applying different levels of augmentation to each branch, which behaves like expanding the training data and improving the quality of network training. Meanwhile, We propose a novel module, Global Dynamic Counting Module(GDCM), to enhance the performance of the HMER decoder, which alleviates recognition inaccuracies in long-distance formula recognition and the occurrence of repeated characters. We release our code at https://github.com/chenkehua/SemiHMER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyue Wang, Guowu Yuan, Hao Zhou, Yi Ma, Yutang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The safe operation of high-voltage transmission lines ensures the power grid's security. Various foreign objects attached to the transmission lines, such as balloons, kites and nesting birds, can significantly affect the safe and stable operation of high-voltage transmission lines. With the advancement of computer vision technology, periodic automatic inspection of foreign objects is efficient and necessary. Existing detection methods have low accuracy because foreign objects at-tached to the transmission lines are complex, including occlusions, diverse object types, significant scale variations, and complex backgrounds. In response to the practical needs of the Yunnan Branch of China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8m-based model for detecting foreign objects on transmission lines. Experiments are conducted on a dataset collected from Yunnan Power Grid. The proposed model enhances the original YOLOv8m by in-corporating a Global Attention Module (GAM) into the backbone to focus on occluded foreign objects, replacing the SPPF module with the SPPCSPC module to augment the model's multiscale feature extraction capability, and introducing the Focal-EIoU loss function to address the issue of high- and low-quality sample imbalances. These improvements accelerate model convergence and enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves a 2.7% increase in mAP_0.5, a 4% increase in mAP_0.5:0.95, and a 6% increase in recall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyue Wang, Guowu Yuan, Hao Zhou, Yi Ma, Yutang Ma, Dong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Insulators are crucial insulation components and structural supports in power grids, playing a vital role in the transmission lines. Due to temperature fluctuations, internal stress, or damage from hail, insulators are prone to injury. Automatic detection of damaged insulators faces challenges such as diverse types, small defect targets, and complex backgrounds and shapes. Most research for detecting insulator defects has focused on a single defect type or a specific material. However, the insulators in the grid's transmission lines have different colors and materials. Various insulator defects coexist, and the existing methods have difficulty meeting the practical application requirements. Current methods suffer from low detection accuracy and mAP0.5 cannot meet application requirements. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv7 model for multi-type insulator defect detection. First, our model replaces the SPPCSPC module with the RFB module to enhance the network's feature extraction capability. Second, a CA mechanism is introduced into the head part to enhance the network's feature representation ability and to improve detection accuracy. Third, a WIoU loss function is employed to address the low-quality samples hindering model generalization during training, thereby improving the model's overall performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model exhibits enhancements across various performance metrics. Specifically, there is a 1.6% advancement in mAP_0.5, a corresponding 1.6% enhancement in mAP_0.5:0.95, a 1.3% elevation in precision, and a 1% increase in recall. Moreover, the model achieves parameter reduction by 3.2 million, leading to a decrease of 2.5 GFLOPS in computational cost. Notably, there is also an improvement of 2.81 milliseconds in single-image detection speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxiao Cai, Thomas H. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning and AI have achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of significant computational resources and energy consumption. This has created an urgent need for a novel, energy-efficient computational fabric to replace the current computing pipeline. Recently, a promising approach has emerged by mimicking spiking neurons in the brain and leveraging oscillators on CMOS for direct computation. In this context, we propose a new and energy efficient machine learning framework implemented on CMOS Oscillator Networks (OscNet). We model the developmental processes of the prenatal brain's visual system using OscNet, updating weights based on the biologically inspired Hebbian rule. This same pipeline is then directly applied to standard machine learning tasks. OscNet is a specially designed hardware and is inherently energy-efficient. Its reliance on forward propagation alone for training further enhances its energy efficiency while maintaining biological plausibility. Simulation validates our designs of OscNet architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that Hebbian learning pipeline on OscNet achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing traditional machine learning algorithms, highlighting its potential as a energy efficient and effective computational paradigm.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07194">Dense Object Detection Based on De-homogenized Queries</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueming Huang, Chenrui Ma, Hao Zhou, Hao Wu, Guowu Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense object detection is widely used in automatic driving, video surveillance, and other fields. This paper focuses on the challenging task of dense object detection. Currently, detection methods based on greedy algorithms, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), often produce many repetitive predictions or missed detections in dense scenarios, which is a common problem faced by NMS-based algorithms. Through the end-to-end DETR (DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the post-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we found that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction in the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of the encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems. To solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to de-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with each other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous self-attention among the queries. In addition, we used joint loss on the output of the encoder that considered both location and confidence prediction to give a higher-quality initialization for queries. Without cumbersome decoder stacking and guaranteeing accuracy, our proposed end-to-end detection framework was more concise and reduced the number of parameters by about 8% compared to deformable DETR. Our method achieved excellent results on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset with 93.6% average precision (AP), 39.2% MR-2, and 84.3% JI. The performance overperformed previous SOTA methods, such as Iter-E2EDet (Progressive End-to-End Object Detection) and MIP (One proposal, Multiple predictions). In addition, our method is more robust in various scenarios with different densities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingpei Ma, Jiaran Cai, Yuansheng Guan, Shenneng Huang, Qiang Zhang, Shunsi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion-based talking face generation models have demonstrated impressive potential in synthesizing videos that accurately match a speech audio clip with a given reference identity. However, existing approaches still encounter significant challenges due to uncontrollable factors, such as inaccurate lip-sync, inappropriate head posture and the lack of fine-grained control over facial expressions. In order to introduce more face-guided conditions beyond speech audio clips, a novel two-stage training framework Playmate is proposed to generate more lifelike facial expressions and talking faces. In the first stage, we introduce a decoupled implicit 3D representation along with a meticulously designed motion-decoupled module to facilitate more accurate attribute disentanglement and generate expressive talking videos directly from audio cues. Then, in the second stage, we introduce an emotion-control module to encode emotion control information into the latent space, enabling fine-grained control over emotions and thereby achieving the ability to generate talking videos with desired emotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Playmate outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of video quality and lip-synchronization, and improves flexibility in controlling emotion and head pose.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osman Tursun, Sinan Kalkan, Simon Denman, Clinton Fookes</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) enables image search using a reference image and text prompt without requiring specialized text-image composition networks trained on large-scale paired data. However, current ZS-CIR approaches face three critical limitations in their reliance on composed text embeddings: static query embedding representations, insufficient utilization of image embeddings, and suboptimal performance when fusing text and image embeddings. To address these challenges, we introduce the Prompt Directional Vector (PDV), a simple yet effective training-free enhancement that captures semantic modifications induced by user prompts. PDV enables three key improvements: (1) dynamic composed text embeddings where prompt adjustments are controllable via a scaling factor, (2) composed image embeddings through semantic transfer from text prompts to image features, and (3) weighted fusion of composed text and image embeddings that enhances retrieval by balancing visual and semantic similarity. Our approach serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing ZS-CIR methods with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PDV consistently improves retrieval performance when integrated with state-of-the-art ZS-CIR approaches, particularly for methods that generate accurate compositional embeddings. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxi Li, Yuchen Guo, Jilai Zheng, Haozhe Lin, Chao Ma, Lu Fang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen an increase in the use of gigapixel-level image and video capture systems and benchmarks with high-resolution wide (HRW) shots. However, unlike close-up shots in the MS COCO dataset, the higher resolution and wider field of view raise unique challenges, such as extreme sparsity and huge scale changes, causing existing close-up detectors inaccuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic sparse vision transformer, dubbed SparseFormer, to bridge the gap of object detection between close-up and HRW shots. The proposed SparseFormer selectively uses attentive tokens to scrutinize the sparsely distributed windows that may contain objects. In this way, it can jointly explore global and local attention by fusing coarse- and fine-grained features to handle huge scale changes. SparseFormer also benefits from a novel Cross-slice non-maximum suppression (C-NMS) algorithm to precisely localize objects from noisy windows and a simple yet effective multi-scale strategy to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two HRW benchmarks, PANDA and DOTA-v1.0, demonstrate that the proposed SparseFormer significantly improves detection accuracy (up to 5.8%) and speed (up to 3x) over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pathology plays a critical role in diagnosing a wide range of diseases, yet existing approaches often rely heavily on task-specific models trained on extensive, well-labeled datasets. These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches often involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and text separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark for assessing multimodal embeddings in pathology. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate Pathology Universal Embeddings. The MLLM4PUE framework not only facilitates robust integration of images and text but also enhances understanding and fusion capabilities across various tasks. We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings. PMEB comprises 15 original tasks drawn from 14 datasets, organized into three meta-tasks: retrieval, classification, and composed retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Latent diffusion models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in many downstream image synthesis tasks. However, customization of latent diffusion models using unauthorized data can severely compromise the privacy and intellectual property rights of data owners. Adversarial examples as protective perturbations have been developed to defend against unauthorized data usage by introducing imperceptible noise to customization samples, preventing diffusion models from effectively learning them. In this paper, we first reveal that the primary reason adversarial examples are effective as protective perturbations in latent diffusion models is the distortion of their latent representations, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments. We then propose the Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) utilizing adapters as an adaptive attack against these protection methods, highlighting their lack of robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CAT method significantly reduces the effectiveness of protective perturbations in customization configurations, urging the community to reconsider and enhance the robustness of existing protective perturbation methods.

<p>Abstract: While recent advances in object suction grasping have shown remarkable progress, significant challenges persist particularly in cluttered and complex parcel handling scenarios. Two fundamental limitations hinder current approaches: (1) the lack of a comprehensive suction grasp dataset tailored for parcel manipulation tasks, and (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse object characteristics including size variations, geometric complexity, and textural diversity. To address these challenges, we present Parcel-Suction-Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 25 thousand cluttered scenes with 410 million precision-annotated suction grasp poses. This dataset is generated through our novel geometric sampling algorithm that enables efficient generation of optimal suction grasps incorporating both physical constraints and material properties. We further propose Diffusion-Suction, an innovative framework that reformulates suction grasp prediction as a conditional generation task through denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our method iteratively refines random noise into suction grasp score maps through visual-conditioned guidance from point cloud observations, effectively learning spatial point-wise affordances from our synthetic dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the simple yet efficient Diffusion-Suction achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models on both Parcel-Suction-Dataset and the public SuctionNet-1Billion benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyu Jiao, Xiaojun Wang, Chengpei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Fingerprint localization has gained significant attention due to its cost-effective deployment, low complexity, and high efficacy. However, traditional methods, while effective for static data, often struggle in dynamic environments where data distributions and feature spaces evolve-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. To address the challenges of robustness and adaptability in fingerprint localization for dynamic indoor environments, this paper proposes DF-Loc, an end-to-end dynamic fingerprint localization system based on multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA). DF-Loc leverages historical data from multiple time scales to facilitate knowledge transfer in specific feature spaces, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities in the target domain and reducing reliance on labeled data. Specifically, the system incorporates a Quality Control (QC) module for CSI data preprocessing and employs image processing techniques for CSI fingerprint feature reconstruction. Additionally, a multi-scale attention-based feature fusion backbone network is designed to extract multi-level transferable fingerprint features. Finally, a dual-stage alignment model aligns the distributions of multiple source-target domain pairs, improving regression characteristics in the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted in office and classroom environments demonstrate that DF-Loc outperforms comparative methods in terms of both localization accuracy and robustness. With 60% of reference points used for training, DF-Loc achieves average localization errors of 0.79m and 3.72m in "same-test" scenarios, and 0.94m and 4.39m in "different-test" scenarios, respectively. This work pioneers an end-to-end multi-source transfer learning approach for fingerprint localization, providing valuable insights for future research in dynamic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In deepfake detection, it is essential to maintain high performance by adjusting the parameters of the detector as new deepfake methods emerge. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically and actively select the small amount of additional data required for the continuous training of deepfake detection models in situations where deepfake detection models are regularly updated. The proposed method automatically selects new training data from a \textit{redundant} pool set containing a large number of images generated by new deepfake methods and real images, using the confidence score of the deepfake detection model as a metric. Experimental results show that the deepfake detection model, continuously trained with a small amount of additional data automatically selected and added to the original training set, significantly and efficiently improved the detection performance, achieving an EER of 2.5% with only 15% of the amount of data in the pool set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Hosein Fadaei, Mohammad-Reza A. Dehaqani</p>
<p>Abstract: It's no secret that video has become the primary way we share information online. That's why there's been a surge in demand for algorithms that can analyze and understand video content. It's a trend going to continue as video continues to dominate the digital landscape. These algorithms will extract and classify related features from the video and will use them to describe the events and objects in the video. Deep neural networks have displayed encouraging outcomes in the realm of feature extraction and video description. This paper will explore the spatiotemporal features found in videos and recent advancements in deep neural networks in video understanding. We will review some of the main trends in video understanding models and their structural design, the main problems, and some offered solutions in this topic. We will also review and compare significant video understanding and action recognition datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Vora, Sauradip Nag, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ATOP (Articulate That Object Part), a novel method based on motion personalization to articulate a 3D object with respect to a part and its motion as prescribed in a text prompt. Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health issue, affecting over 10% of the population and causing significant mortality. While kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for CKD diagnosis and treatment, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for kidney pathology segmentation hinders progress in the field. To address this, we organized the Kidney Pathology Image Segmentation (KPIs) Challenge, introducing a dataset that incorporates preclinical rodent models of CKD with over 10,000 annotated glomeruli from 60+ Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained whole slide images. The challenge includes two tasks, patch-level segmentation and whole slide image segmentation and detection, evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and F1-score. By encouraging innovative segmentation methods that adapt to diverse CKD models and tissue conditions, the KPIs Challenge aims to advance kidney pathology analysis, establish new benchmarks, and enable precise, large-scale quantification for disease research and diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Wang, Zhiqiang Yan, Junkai Fan, Jun Li, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth completion endeavors to reconstruct a dense depth map from sparse depth measurements, leveraging the information provided by a corresponding color image. Existing approaches mostly hinge on single-scale propagation strategies that iteratively ameliorate initial coarse depth estimates through pixel-level message passing. Despite their commendable outcomes, these techniques are frequently hampered by computational inefficiencies and a limited grasp of scene context. To circumvent these challenges, we introduce LP-Net, an innovative framework that implements a multi-scale, progressive prediction paradigm based on Laplacian Pyramid decomposition. Diverging from propagation-based approaches, LP-Net initiates with a rudimentary, low-resolution depth prediction to encapsulate the global scene context, subsequently refining this through successive upsampling and the reinstatement of high-frequency details at incremental scales. We have developed two novel modules to bolster this strategy: 1) the Multi-path Feature Pyramid module, which segregates feature maps into discrete pathways, employing multi-scale transformations to amalgamate comprehensive spatial information, and 2) the Selective Depth Filtering module, which dynamically learns to apply both smoothness and sharpness filters to judiciously mitigate noise while accentuating intricate details. By integrating these advancements, LP-Net not only secures state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across both outdoor and indoor benchmarks such as KITTI, NYUv2, and TOFDC, but also demonstrates superior computational efficiency. At the time of submission, LP-Net ranks 1st among all peer-reviewed methods on the official KITTI leaderboard.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-class cell segmentation in high-resolution gigapixel whole slide images (WSI) is crucial for various clinical applications. However, training such models typically requires labor-intensive, pixel-wise annotations by domain experts. Recent efforts have democratized this process by involving lay annotators without medical expertise. However, conventional non-agent-based approaches struggle to handle annotation noise adaptively, as they lack mechanisms to mitigate false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) at both the image-feature and pixel levels. In this paper, we propose a consensus-aware self-corrective AI agent that leverages the Consensus Matrix to guide its learning process. The Consensus Matrix defines regions where both the AI and annotators agree on cell and non-cell annotations, which are prioritized with stronger supervision. Conversely, areas of disagreement are adaptively weighted based on their feature similarity to high-confidence agreement regions, with more similar regions receiving greater attention. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to separate features of noisy regions from those of reliable agreement regions by maximizing their dissimilarity. This paradigm enables the AI to iteratively refine noisy labels, enhancing its robustness. Validated on one real-world lay-annotated cell dataset and two simulated noisy datasets, our method demonstrates improved segmentation performance, effectively correcting FP and FN errors and showcasing its potential for training robust models on noisy datasets. The official implementation and cell annotations are publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/CASC-AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Rajabi, Jana Kosecka</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps \cite{vlmaps} on the complex R2R-Habitat \cite{r2r} instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Pengfei Li, Yupeng Zheng, Wei Sun, Yan Wang, Yilun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding world dynamics is crucial for planning in autonomous driving. Recent methods attempt to achieve this by learning a 3D occupancy world model that forecasts future surrounding scenes based on current observation. However, 3D occupancy labels are still required to produce promising results. Considering the high annotation cost for 3D outdoor scenes, we propose a semi-supervised vision-centric 3D occupancy world model, PreWorld, to leverage the potential of 2D labels through a novel two-stage training paradigm: the self-supervised pre-training stage and the fully-supervised fine-tuning stage. Specifically, during the pre-training stage, we utilize an attribute projection head to generate different attribute fields of a scene (e.g., RGB, density, semantic), thus enabling temporal supervision from 2D labels via volume rendering techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective state-conditioned forecasting module to recursively forecast future occupancy and ego trajectory in a direct manner. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, and demonstrate that PreWorld achieves competitive performance across 3D occupancy prediction, 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Structural information in images is crucial for aesthetic assessment, and it is widely recognized in the artistic field that imitating the structure of other works significantly infringes on creators' rights. The advancement of diffusion models has led to AI-generated content imitating artists' structural creations, yet effective detection methods are still lacking. In this paper, we define this phenomenon as "structural infringement" and propose a corresponding detection method. Additionally, we develop quantitative metrics and create manually annotated datasets for evaluation: the SIA dataset of synthesized data, and the SIR dataset of real data. Due to the current lack of datasets for structural infringement detection, we propose a new data synthesis strategy based on diffusion models and LLM, successfully training a structural infringement detection model. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect structural infringements and achieve notable improvements on annotated test sets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07331">ERANet: Edge Replacement Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Meniscus Segmentation with Prototype Consistency Alignment and Conditional Self-Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyue Li, Yongcheng Yao, Junru Zhong, Shutian Zhao, Yudong Zhang, Shuihua Wang, Jin Hong, Weitian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual segmentation is labor-intensive, and automatic segmentation remains challenging due to the inherent variability in meniscal morphology, partial volume effects, and low contrast between the meniscus and surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, we propose ERANet, an innovative semi-supervised framework for meniscus segmentation that effectively leverages both labeled and unlabeled images through advanced augmentation and learning strategies. ERANet integrates three key components: edge replacement augmentation (ERA), prototype consistency alignment (PCA), and a conditional self-training (CST) strategy within a mean teacher architecture. ERA introduces anatomically relevant perturbations by simulating meniscal variations, ensuring that augmentations align with the structural context. PCA enhances segmentation performance by aligning intra-class features and promoting compact, discriminative feature representations, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. CST improves segmentation robustness by iteratively refining pseudo-labels and mitigating the impact of label noise during training. Together, these innovations establish ERANet as a robust and scalable solution for meniscus segmentation, effectively addressing key barriers to practical implementation. We validated ERANet comprehensively on 3D Double Echo Steady State (DESS) and 3D Fast/Turbo Spin Echo (FSE/TSE) MRI sequences. The results demonstrate the superior performance of ERANet compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework achieves reliable and accurate segmentation of meniscus structures, even when trained on minimal labeled data. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the synergistic contributions of ERA, PCA, and CST, solidifying ERANet as a transformative solution for semi-supervised meniscus segmentation in medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ai Chen, Yuxu Lu, Dong Yang, Junlin Zhou, Yan Fu, Duanbing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in vision-driven measurement systems (VMS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxu Lu, Ai Chen, Dong Yang, Ryan Wen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in computer vision technology have facilitated the extensive deployment of intelligent transportation systems and visual surveillance systems across various applications, including autonomous driving, public safety, and environmental monitoring. However, adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly degrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM), an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyu An, Xinfeng Zhang, Shijie Zhao, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to limitations of storage and bandwidth, videos stored and transmitted on the Internet are usually low-quality with low-resolution and compression noise. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient technique to enhance video resolution, relatively VSR methods focus on compressed videos. Directly applying general VSR approaches leads to the failure of improving practical videos, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. Recently, diffusion models have achieved superior performance in low-level visual tasks, and their high-realism generation capability enables them to be applied in VSR. To synthesize more compression-lost details and refine temporal consistency, we propose a novel Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model for compressed VSR. Specifically, we introduce a distortion Control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs and guide the generation. Next, the diffusion model executes the denoising process for texture generation with fine-tuned spatial prompt-based compression-aware module (PCAM) and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). PCAM extracts features to encode specific compression information dynamically. STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism to a spatio-temporal dimension for capturing temporal correlation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing compressed videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of noncommunicable disease-related deaths, require early and accurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Taking advantage of advances in machine learning and deep learning, multiple approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the challenge of detecting ECG anomalies. Typically, these methods are based on the manual interpretation of ECG signals, which is time consuming and depends on the expertise of healthcare professionals. The objective of this work is to propose a deep learning system, FADE, designed for normal ECG forecasting and anomaly detection, which reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets and manual interpretation. FADE has been trained in a self-supervised manner with a novel morphological inspired loss function. Unlike conventional models that learn from labeled anomalous ECG waveforms, our approach predicts the future of normal ECG signals, thus avoiding the need for extensive labeled datasets. Using a novel distance function to compare forecasted ECG signals with actual sensor data, our method effectively identifies cardiac anomalies. Additionally, this approach can be adapted to new contexts through domain adaptation techniques. To evaluate our proposal, we performed a set of experiments using two publicly available datasets: MIT-BIH NSR and MIT-BIH Arrythmia. The results demonstrate that our system achieves an average accuracy of 83.84% in anomaly detection, while correctly classifying normal ECG signals with an accuracy of 85.46%. Our proposed approach exhibited superior performance in the early detection of cardiac anomalies in ECG signals, surpassing previous methods that predominantly identify a limited range of anomalies. FADE effectively detects both abnormal heartbeats and arrhythmias, offering significant advantages in healthcare through cost reduction or processing of large-scale ECG data.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D vision is of paramount importance for numerous applications ranging from machine intelligence to precision metrology. Despite much recent progress, the majority of 3D imaging hardware remains bulky and complicated and provides much lower image resolution compared to their 2D counterparts. Moreover, there are many well-known scenarios that existing 3D imaging solutions frequently fail. Here, we introduce an extended monocular 3D imaging (EM3D) framework that fully exploits the vectorial wave nature of light. Via the multi-stage fusion of diffraction- and polarization-based depth cues, using a compact monocular camera equipped with a diffractive-refractive hybrid lens, we experimentally demonstrate the snapshot acquisition of a million-pixel and accurate 3D point cloud for extended scenes that are traditionally challenging, including those with low texture, being highly reflective, or nearly transparent, without a data prior. Furthermore, we discover that the combination of depth and polarization information can unlock unique new opportunities in material identification, which may further expand machine intelligence for applications like target recognition and face anti-spoofing. The straightforward yet powerful architecture thus opens up a new path for a higher-dimensional machine vision in a minimal form factor, facilitating the deployment of monocular cameras for applications in much more diverse scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce EgoTextVQA, a novel and rigorously constructed benchmark for egocentric QA assistance involving scene text. EgoTextVQA contains 1.5K ego-view videos and 7K scene-text aware questions that reflect real-user needs in outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping activities. The questions are designed to elicit identification and reasoning on scene text in an egocentric and dynamic environment. With EgoTextVQA, we comprehensively evaluate 10 prominent multimodal large language models. Currently, all models struggle, and the best results (Gemini 1.5 Pro) are around 33% accuracy, highlighting the severe deficiency of these techniques in egocentric QA assistance. Our further investigations suggest that precise temporal grounding and multi-frame reasoning, along with high resolution and auxiliary scene-text inputs, are key for better performance.

<p>Abstract: The perception system is a a critical role of an autonomous driving system for ensuring safety. The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to investigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Bahari Malayeri, Matthias Seibold, Nicola Cavalcanti, Jonas Hein, Sascha Jecklin, Lazaros Vlachopoulos, Sandro Fucentese, Sandro Hodel, Philipp Furnstahl</p>
<p>Abstract: This study aims to advance surgical phase recognition in arthroscopic procedures, specifically Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, by introducing the first arthroscopy dataset and developing a novel transformer-based model. We aim to establish a benchmark for arthroscopic surgical phase recognition by leveraging spatio-temporal features to address the specific challenges of arthroscopic videos including limited field of view, occlusions, and visual distortions. We developed the ACL27 dataset, comprising 27 videos of ACL surgeries, each labeled with surgical phases. Our model employs a transformer-based architecture, utilizing temporal-aware frame-wise feature extraction through a ResNet-50 and transformer layers. This approach integrates spatio-temporal features and introduces a Surgical Progress Index (SPI) to quantify surgery progression. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and Jaccard Index on the ACL27 and Cholec80 datasets. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 72.91% on the ACL27 dataset. On the Cholec80 dataset, the model achieved a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 92.4%. The SPI demonstrated an output error of 10.6% and 9.86% on ACL27 and Cholec80 datasets respectively, indicating reliable surgery progression estimation. This study introduces a significant advancement in surgical phase recognition for arthroscopy, providing a comprehensive dataset and a robust transformer-based model. The results validate the model's effectiveness and generalizability, highlighting its potential to improve surgical training, real-time assistance, and operational efficiency in orthopedic surgery. The publicly available dataset and code will facilitate future research and development in this critical field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaodong Bing, Linze Li, Jiajun Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) in transformers often faces challenges due to misalignment in the number of attention heads between teacher and student models. Existing methods either require identical head counts or introduce projectors to bridge dimensional gaps, limiting flexibility and efficiency. We propose Squeezing-Heads Distillation (SHD), a novel approach that enables seamless knowledge transfer between models with varying head counts by compressing multi-head attention maps via efficient linear approximation. Unlike prior work, SHD eliminates alignment barriers without additional parameters or architectural modifications. Our method dynamically approximates the combined effect of multiple teacher heads into fewer student heads, preserving fine-grained attention patterns while reducing redundancy. Experiments across language (LLaMA, GPT) and vision (DiT, MDT) generative and vision (DeiT) discriminative tasks demonstrate SHD's effectiveness: it outperforms logit-based and feature-alignment KD baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification, image generation language fine-tuning, and language pre-training. The key innovations of flexible head compression, projector-free design, and linear-time complexity make SHD a versatile and scalable solution for distilling modern transformers. This work bridges a critical gap in KD, enabling efficient deployment of compact models without compromising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viacheslav Vasilev, Julia Agafonova, Nikolai Gerasimenko, Alexander Kapitanov, Polina Mikhailova, Evelina Mironova, Denis Dimitrov</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have gained popularity among users around the world. However, many of these models exhibit a strong bias toward English-speaking cultures, ignoring or misrepresenting the unique characteristics of other language groups, countries, and nationalities. The lack of cultural awareness can reduce the generation quality and lead to undesirable consequences such as unintentional insult, and the spread of prejudice. In contrast to the field of natural language processing, cultural awareness in computer vision has not been explored as extensively. In this paper, we strive to reduce this gap. We propose a RusCode benchmark for evaluating the quality of text-to-image generation containing elements of the Russian cultural code. To do this, we form a list of 19 categories that best represent the features of Russian visual culture. Our final dataset consists of 1250 text prompts in Russian and their translations into English. The prompts cover a wide range of topics, including complex concepts from art, popular culture, folk traditions, famous people's names, natural objects, scientific achievements, etc. We present the results of a human evaluation of the side-by-side comparison of Russian visual concepts representations using popular generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwei Zhou, Haifeng Zhao, Dengdi Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, the poor quality of unlabeled data and the uncertainty in the model's predictions lead to models that inevitably produce erroneous pseudo-labels. These errors accumulate throughout model training, thereby weakening the model's performance. We found that these erroneous pseudo-labels are typically concentrated in high-uncertainty regions. Traditional methods improve performance by directly discarding pseudo-labels in these regions, but this can also result in neglecting potentially valuable training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional uncertainty-aware region learning strategy. In training labeled data, we focus on high-uncertainty regions, using precise label information to guide the model's learning in potentially uncontrollable areas. Meanwhile, in the training of unlabeled data, we concentrate on low-uncertainty regions to reduce the interference of erroneous pseudo-labels on the model. Through this bidirectional learning strategy, the model's overall performance has significantly improved. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on different medical image segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Zhu, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou, Qinying Gu, Nanyang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a style-reference image as the additional image condition, text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating images that possess the content of text prompts while adopting the visual style of the reference image. However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle to disentangle content and style from style-reference images, leading to issues such as content leakages. To address this issue, we propose a masking-based method that efficiently decouples content from style without the need of tuning any model parameters. By simply masking specific elements in the style reference's image features, we uncover a critical yet under-explored principle: guiding with appropriately-selected fewer conditions (e.g., dropping several image feature elements) can efficiently avoid unwanted content flowing into the diffusion models, enhancing the style transfer performances of text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we validate this finding both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments across various styles demonstrate the effectiveness of our masking-based method and support our theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Wang, Muhammad Ibrahim, Atif Mansoor, Hasnein Tareque, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Road information extraction from 3D point clouds is useful for urban planning and traffic management. Existing methods often rely on local features and the refraction angle of lasers from kerbs, which makes them sensitive to variable kerb designs and issues in high-density areas due to data homogeneity. We propose an approach for extracting road points and fitting centrelines using a top-down view of LiDAR based ground-collected point clouds. This prospective view reduces reliance on specific kerb design and results in better road extraction. We first perform statistical outlier removal and density-based clustering to reduce noise from 3D point cloud data. Next, we perform ground point filtering using a grid-based segmentation method that adapts to diverse road scenarios and terrain characteristics. The filtered points are then projected onto a 2D plane, and the road is extracted by a skeletonisation algorithm. The skeleton is back-projected onto the 3D point cloud with calculated normals, which guide a region growing algorithm to find nearby road points. The extracted road points are then smoothed with the Savitzky-Golay filter to produce the final centreline. Our initial approach without post-processing of road skeleton achieved 67% in IoU by testing on the Perth CBD dataset with different road types. Incorporating the post-processing of the road skeleton improved the extraction of road points around the smoothed skeleton. The refined approach achieved a higher IoU value of 73% and with 23% reduction in the processing time. Our approach offers a generalised and computationally efficient solution that combines 3D and 2D processing techniques, laying the groundwork for future road reconstruction and 3D-to-2D point cloud alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Weijler, Pedro Hermosilla</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending the translation equivariance property of convolutional neural networks to larger symmetry groups has been shown to reduce sample complexity and enable more discriminative feature learning. Further, exploiting additional symmetries facilitates greater weight sharing than standard convolutions, leading to an enhanced network expressivity without an increase in parameter count. However, extending the equivariant properties of a convolution layer comes at a computational cost. In particular, for 3D data, expanding equivariance to the SE(3) group (rotation and translation) results in a 6D convolution operation, which is not tractable for larger data samples such as 3D scene scans. While efforts have been made to develop efficient SE(3) equivariant networks, existing approaches rely on discretization or only introduce global rotation equivariance. This limits their applicability to point clouds representing a scene composed of multiple objects. This work presents an efficient, continuous, and local SE(3) equivariant convolution layer for point cloud processing based on general group convolution and local reference frames. Our experiments show that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of datasets and tasks, including object classification and semantic segmentation, with negligible computational overhead.</p>

In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video.

Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Chu, Menghan Xia, Mengyao Yuan, Xin Liu, Tapio Seppanen, Guoying Zhao, Jingang Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure non-contact physiological signals from facial videos, which has shown great potential in many applications. Most existing methods directly extract video-based rPPG features by designing neural networks for heart rate estimation. Although they can achieve acceptable results, the recovery of rPPG signal faces intractable challenges when interference from real-world scenarios takes place on facial video. Specifically, facial videos are inevitably affected by non-physiological factors (e.g., camera device noise, defocus, and motion blur), leading to the distortion of extracted rPPG signals. Recent rPPG extraction methods are easily affected by interference and degradation, resulting in noisy rPPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CodePhys, which innovatively treats rPPG measurement as a code query task in a noise-free proxy space (i.e., codebook) constructed by ground-truth PPG signals. We consider noisy rPPG features as queries and generate high-fidelity rPPG features by matching them with noise-free PPG features from the codebook. Our approach also incorporates a spatial-aware encoder network with a spatial attention mechanism to highlight physiologically active areas and uses a distillation loss to reduce the influence of non-periodic visual interference. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CodePhys outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sixiao Zheng, Zimian Peng, Yanpeng Zhou, Yi Zhu, Hang Xu, Xiangru Huang, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available. Project page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VidCRAFT3/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangwen Wu, Lechao Cheng, Shengeng Tang, Xiaofeng Zhu, Chaowei Fang, Dingwen Zhang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) seeks to enable a model to sequentially learn new classes while retaining knowledge of previously learned ones. Balancing flexibility and stability remains a significant challenge, particularly when the task ID is unknown. To address this, our study reveals that the gap in feature distribution between novel and existing tasks is primarily driven by differences in mean and covariance moments. Building on this insight, we propose a novel semantic drift calibration method that incorporates mean shift compensation and covariance calibration. Specifically, we calculate each class's mean by averaging its sample embeddings and estimate task shifts using weighted embedding changes based on their proximity to the previous mean, effectively capturing mean shifts for all learned classes with each new task. We also apply Mahalanobis distance constraint for covariance calibration, aligning class-specific embedding covariances between old and current networks to mitigate the covariance shift. Additionally, we integrate a feature-level self-distillation approach to enhance generalization. Comprehensive experiments on commonly used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Q. Rieck</p>
<p>Abstract: The Perspective-Three-Point Problem (P3P) is solved by first focusing on determining the directions of the lines through pairs of control points, relative to the camera, rather than the distances from the camera to the control points. The analysis of this produces an efficient, accurate and reasonably simple P3P solver, which is compared with a state-of-the-art P3P solver, "Lambda Twist." Both methods depend on the accurate computation of a single root of a cubic polynomial. They have been implemented and tested for a wide range of control-point triangles, and under certain reasonable restrictions, the new method is noticably more accurate than Lambda Twist, though it is slower. However, the principal value of the present work is not in introducing yet another P3P solver, but lies rather in the discovery of an intimate connection between the P3P problem and a special family of elliptic curves that includes curves utilized in cryptography. This holds the potential for further advances in a number of directions. To make this connection, an interesting spherical analogue of an ancient "sliding" problem is stated and solved.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting future scene representations is a crucial task for enabling robots to understand and interact with the environment. However, most existing methods rely on video sequences and simulations with precise action annotations, limiting their ability to leverage the large amount of available unlabeled video data. To address this challenge, we propose PlaySlot, an object-centric video prediction model that infers object representations and latent actions from unlabeled video sequences. It then uses these representations to forecast future object states and video frames. PlaySlot allows to generate multiple possible futures conditioned on latent actions, which can be inferred from video dynamics, provided by a user, or generated by a learned action policy, thus enabling versatile and interpretable world modeling. Our results show that PlaySlot outperforms both stochastic and object-centric baselines for video prediction across different environments. Furthermore, we show that our inferred latent actions can be used to learn robot behaviors sample-efficiently from unlabeled video demonstrations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacong Xu, Shao-Yuan Lo, Bardia Safaei, Vishal M. Patel, Isht Dwivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/</p>

Based on two regularization cases, namely the $l_1$ norm and total variation norm, we perform numerical experiments to assess the performance of our proposed algorithm.

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved excellent rendering quality with fast training and rendering speed. However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Daniel Salz, Zhe Li, Keran Rong, Xiaohua Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide an empirical investigation of the potential of pre-training vision-language models on an unprecedented scale: 100 billion examples. We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Perceiving the environment and its changes over time corresponds to two fundamental yet heterogeneous types of information: semantics and motion. Previous end-to-end autonomous driving works represent both types of information in a single feature vector. However, including motion tasks, such as prediction and planning, always impairs detection and tracking performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer in multi-task learning. To address this issue, we propose Neural-Bayes motion decoding, a novel parallel detection, tracking, and prediction method separating semantic and motion learning, similar to the Bayes filter. Specifically, we employ a set of learned motion queries that operate in parallel with the detection and tracking queries, sharing a unified set of recursively updated reference points. Moreover, we employ interactive semantic decoding to enhance information exchange in semantic tasks, promoting positive transfer. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show improvements of 5% in detection and 11% in tracking. Our method achieves state-of-the-art collision rates in open-loop planning evaluation without any modifications to the planning module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Wu, Yaonan Wang, Yang Mo, Qing Zhu, He Xie, Haotian Wu, Mingtao Feng, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration is an essential step for free-form blade reconstruction in industrial measurement. Nonetheless, measuring defects of the 3D acquisition system unavoidably result in noisy and incomplete point cloud data, which renders efficient and accurate registration challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel global registration method that is based on the minimum potential energy (MPE) method to address these problems. The basic strategy is that the objective function is defined as the minimum potential energy optimization function of the physical registration system. The function distributes more weight to the majority of inlier points and less weight to the noise and outliers, which essentially reduces the influence of perturbations in the mathematical formulation. We decompose the solution into a globally optimal approximation procedure and a fine registration process with the trimmed iterative closest point algorithm to boost convergence. The approximation procedure consists of two main steps. First, according to the construction of the force traction operator, we can simply compute the position of the potential energy minimum. Second, to find the MPE point, we propose a new theory that employs two flags to observe the status of the registration procedure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on four types of blades. The proposed method outperforms the other global methods in terms of both accuracy and noise resistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanxun Lu, Jingyang Zhang, Tian Fang, Jean-Daniel Nahmias, Yanghai Tsin, Long Quan, Xun Cao, Yao Yao, Shiwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Matrix3D, a unified model that performs several photogrammetry subtasks, including pose estimation, depth prediction, and novel view synthesis using just the same model. Matrix3D utilizes a multi-modal diffusion transformer (DiT) to integrate transformations across several modalities, such as images, camera parameters, and depth maps. The key to Matrix3D's large-scale multi-modal training lies in the incorporation of a mask learning strategy. This enables full-modality model training even with partially complete data, such as bi-modality data of image-pose and image-depth pairs, thus significantly increases the pool of available training data. Matrix3D demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and novel view synthesis tasks. Additionally, it offers fine-grained control through multi-round interactions, making it an innovative tool for 3D content creation. Project page: https://nju-3dv.github.io/projects/matrix3d.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Yi, Shitong Shao, Tian Ye, Jiantong Zhao, Qingyu Yin, Michael Lingelbach, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian, Enze Xie, Daquan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bing Fan, Yunhe Feng, Yapeng Tian, Yuewei Lin, Yan Huang, Heng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric visual query localization (EgoVQL) focuses on localizing the target of interest in space and time from first-person videos, given a visual query. Despite recent progressive, existing methods often struggle to handle severe object appearance changes and cluttering background in the video due to lacking sufficient target cues, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we introduce PRVQL, a novel Progressive knowledge-guided Refinement framework for EgoVQL. The core is to continuously exploit target-relevant knowledge directly from videos and utilize it as guidance to refine both query and video features for improving target localization. Our PRVQL contains multiple processing stages. The target knowledge from one stage, comprising appearance and spatial knowledge extracted via two specially designed knowledge learning modules, are utilized as guidance to refine the query and videos features for the next stage, which are used to generate more accurate knowledge for further feature refinement. With such a progressive process, target knowledge in PRVQL can be gradually improved, which, in turn, leads to better refined query and video features for localization in the final stage. Compared to previous methods, our PRVQL, besides the given object cues, enjoys additional crucial target information from a video as guidance to refine features, and hence enhances EgoVQL in complicated scenes. In our experiments on challenging Ego4D, PRVQL achieves state-of-the-art result and largely surpasses other methods, showing its efficacy. Our code, model and results will be released at https://github.com/fb-reps/PRVQL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Camile Lendering, Bernardo Perrone Ribeiro, \v{Z}iga Emer\v{s}i\v{c}, Peter Peer</p>
<p>Abstract: Ear recognition is a contactless and unobtrusive biometric technique with applications across various domains. However, deploying high-performing ear recognition models on resource-constrained devices is challenging, limiting their applicability and widespread adoption. This paper introduces EdgeEar, a lightweight model based on a proposed hybrid CNN-transformer architecture to solve this problem. By incorporating low-rank approximations into specific linear layers, EdgeEar reduces its parameter count by a factor of 50 compared to the current state-of-the-art, bringing it below two million while maintaining competitive accuracy. Evaluation on the Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge (UERC2023) benchmark shows that EdgeEar achieves the lowest EER while significantly reducing computational costs. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of efficient and accurate ear recognition, which we believe will contribute to the wider adoption of ear biometrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhuai Ren, Shuming Ma, Xu Sun, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabeya Tus Sadia, Md Atik Ahamed, Qiang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is crucial for understanding gene expression in spatial context. Existing methods for such integration have limited performance, with structural similarity often below 60\%, We attribute this limitation to the failure to consider causal relationships between genes. We present CausalGeD, which combines diffusion and autoregressive processes to leverage these relationships. By generalizing the Causal Attention Transformer from image generation to gene expression data, our model captures regulatory mechanisms without predefined relationships. Across 10 tissue datasets, CausalGeD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5- 32\% in key metrics, including Pearson's correlation and structural similarity, advancing both technical and biological insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stanislav Fort, Jonathan Whitaker</p>
<p>Abstract: We demonstrate that discriminative models inherently contain powerful generative capabilities, challenging the fundamental distinction between discriminative and generative architectures. Our method, Direct Ascent Synthesis (DAS), reveals these latent capabilities through multi-resolution optimization of CLIP model representations. While traditional inversion attempts produce adversarial patterns, DAS achieves high-quality image synthesis by decomposing optimization across multiple spatial scales (1x1 to 224x224), requiring no additional training. This approach not only enables diverse applications -- from text-to-image generation to style transfer -- but maintains natural image statistics ($1/f^2$ spectrum) and guides the generation away from non-robust adversarial patterns. Our results demonstrate that standard discriminative models encode substantially richer generative knowledge than previously recognized, providing new perspectives on model interpretability and the relationship between adversarial examples and natural image synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07778">Stay-Positive: A Case for Ignoring Real Image Features in Fake Image Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudh Sundara Rajan, Yong Jae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting AI generated images is a challenging yet essential task. A primary difficulty arises from the detectors tendency to rely on spurious patterns, such as compression artifacts, which can influence its decisions. These issues often stem from specific patterns that the detector associates with the real data distribution, making it difficult to isolate the actual generative traces. We argue that an image should be classified as fake if and only if it contains artifacts introduced by the generative model. Based on this premise, we propose Stay Positive, an algorithm designed to constrain the detectors focus to generative artifacts while disregarding those associated with real data. Experimental results demonstrate that detectors trained with Stay Positive exhibit reduced susceptibility to spurious correlations, leading to improved generalization and robustness to post processing. Additionally, unlike detectors that associate artifacts with real images, those that focus purely on fake artifacts are better at detecting inpainted real images.</p>

<p>Abstract: Flag manifolds encode hierarchical nested sequences of subspaces and serve as powerful structures for various computer vision and machine learning applications. Despite their utility in tasks such as dimensionality reduction, motion averaging, and subspace clustering, current applications are often restricted to extracting flags using common matrix decomposition methods like the singular value decomposition. Here, we address the need for a general algorithm to factorize and work with hierarchical datasets. In particular, we propose a novel, flag-based method that decomposes arbitrary hierarchical real-valued data into a hierarchy-preserving flag representation in Stiefel coordinates. Our work harnesses the potential of flag manifolds in applications including denoising, clustering, and few-shot learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Lopes, Valentin Deschaintre, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Raoul de Charette</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MatSwap, a method to transfer materials to designated surfaces in an image photorealistically. Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph. In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain. In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping. To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model. We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images. As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will release our code and data upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Pippo, a generative model capable of producing 1K resolution dense turnaround videos of a person from a single casually clicked photo. Pippo is a multi-view diffusion transformer and does not require any additional inputs - e.g., a fitted parametric model or camera parameters of the input image. We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training. Finally, we also introduce an improved metric to evaluate 3D consistency of multi-view generations, and show that Pippo outperforms existing works on multi-view human generation from a single image.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition and generation have emerged as crucial topics in Artificial Intelligence research, playing a significant role in enhancing human-computer interaction within healthcare, customer service, and other fields. Although several reviews have been conducted on emotion recognition and generation as separate entities, many of these works are either fragmented or limited to specific methodologies, lacking a comprehensive overview of recent developments and trends across different modalities. In this survey, we provide a holistic review aimed at researchers beginning their exploration in emotion recognition and generation. We introduce the fundamental principles underlying emotion recognition and generation across facial, vocal, and textual modalities. This work categorises recent state-of-the-art research into distinct technical approaches and explains the theoretical foundations and motivations behind these methodologies, offering a clearer understanding of their application. Moreover, we discuss evaluation metrics, comparative analyses, and current limitations, shedding light on the challenges faced by researchers in the field. Finally, we propose future research directions to address these challenges and encourage further exploration into developing robust, effective, and ethically responsible emotion recognition and generation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical images often exhibit low and blurred contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues, with considerable variation in lesion edges and shapes even within the same disease, leading to significant challenges in segmentation. Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarize the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.</p>

<p>Abstract: Archaeological pottery documentation traditionally requires a time-consuming manual process of converting pencil sketches into publication-ready inked drawings. I present PyPotteryInk, an open-source automated pipeline that transforms archaeological pottery sketches into standardised publication-ready drawings using a one-step diffusion model. Built on a modified img2img-turbo architecture, the system processes drawings in a single forward pass while preserving crucial morphological details and maintaining archaeologic documentation standards and analytical value. The model employs an efficient patch-based approach with dynamic overlap, enabling high-resolution output regardless of input drawing size. I demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a dataset of Italian protohistoric pottery drawings, where it successfully captures both fine details like decorative patterns and structural elements like vessel profiles or handling elements. Expert evaluation confirms that the generated drawings meet publication standards while significantly reducing processing time from hours to seconds per drawing. The model can be fine-tuned to adapt to different archaeological contexts with minimal training data, making it versatile across various pottery documentation styles. The pre-trained models, the Python library and comprehensive documentation are provided to facilitate adoption within the archaeological research community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ischaemic stroke, a leading cause of death and disability, critically relies on neuroimaging for characterising the anatomical pattern of injury. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides the highest expressivity in ischemic stroke but poses substantial challenges for automated lesion segmentation: susceptibility artefacts, morphological heterogeneity, age-related comorbidities, time-dependent signal dynamics, instrumental variability, and limited labelled data. Current U-Net-based models therefore underperform, a problem accentuated by inadequate evaluation metrics that focus on mean performance, neglecting anatomical, subpopulation, and acquisition-dependent variability. Here, we present a high-performance DWI lesion segmentation tool addressing these challenges through optimized vision transformer-based architectures, integration of 3563 annotated lesions from multi-site data, and algorithmic enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art results. We further propose a novel evaluative framework assessing model fidelity, equity (across demographics and lesion subtypes), anatomical precision, and robustness to instrumental variability, promoting clinical and research utility. This work advances stroke imaging by reconciling model expressivity with domain-specific challenges and redefining performance benchmarks to prioritize equity and generalizability, critical for personalized medicine and mechanistic research.</p>

However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a small amount of works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. And the finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a foundational universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but also we propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the- art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves cross-modality retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work to study retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behzad Hejrati, Soumyanil Banerjee, Carri Glide-Hurst, Ming Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been used extensively for high quality image and video generation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Laouedj, Yuzhe Wang, Jesus Villalba, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we explored the use of spectrograms to represent handwriting signals for assessing neurodegenerative diseases, including 42 healthy controls (CTL), 35 subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD), 21 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and 15 with Parkinson's Disease Mimics (PDM). We applied CNN and CNN-BLSTM models for binary classification using both multi-channel fixed-size and frame-based spectrograms. Our results showed that handwriting tasks and spectrogram channel combinations significantly impacted classification performance. The highest F1-score (89.8%) was achieved for AD vs. CTL, while PD vs. CTL reached 74.5%, and PD vs. PDM scored 77.97%. CNN consistently outperformed CNN-BLSTM. Different sliding window lengths were tested for constructing frame-based spectrograms. A 1-second window worked best for AD, longer windows improved PD classification, and window length had little effect on PD vs. PDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Torre, Suset Barroso-Solares, M. A. Rodr\'iguez-P\'erez, Javier Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: The structural characterization is an essential task in the study of porous materials. To achieve reliable results, it requires to evaluate images with hundreds of pores. Current methods require large time amounts and are subjected to human errors and subjectivity. A completely automatic tool would not only speed up the process but also enhance its reliability and reproducibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is the study of a deep-learning-based technique for the structural characterization of porous materials, through the use of a convolutional neural network. Several fine-tuned Mask R CNN models are evaluated using different training configurations in four separate datasets each composed of numerous SEM images of diverse polymeric porous materials: closed-pore extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane (PU), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and open-pore PU. Results prove the tool capable of providing very accurate results, equivalent to those achieved by time consuming manual methods, in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadit Barua, Karim Benharrak, Meng Chen, Mina Huh, Amy Pavel</p>
<p>Abstract: Short-form videos are popular on platforms like TikTok and Instagram as they quickly capture viewers' attention. Many creators repurpose their long-form videos to produce short-form videos, but creators report that planning, extracting, and arranging clips from long-form videos is challenging. Currently, creators make extractive short-form videos composed of existing long-form video clips or abstractive short-form videos by adding newly recorded narration to visuals. While extractive videos maintain the original connection between audio and visuals, abstractive videos offer flexibility in selecting content to be included in a shorter time. We present Lotus, a system that combines both approaches to balance preserving the original content with flexibility over the content. Lotus first creates an abstractive short-form video by generating both a short-form script and its corresponding speech, then matching long-form video clips to the generated narration. Creators can then add extractive clips with an automated method or Lotus's editing interface. Lotus's interface can be used to further refine the short-form video. We compare short-form videos generated by Lotus with those using an extractive baseline method. In our user study, we compare creating short-form videos using Lotus to participants' existing practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kungang Zhang, Daniel W. Apley, Wei Chen, Wing K. Liu, L. Catherine Brinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Microstructure of materials is often characterized through image analysis to understand processing-structure-properties linkages. We propose a largely automated framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised learning methods to classify micrographs according to microstructure phase/class and, for multiphase microstructures, segments them into different homogeneous regions. With the advance of manufacturing and imaging techniques, the ultra-high resolution of imaging that reveals the complexity of microstructures and the rapidly increasing quantity of images (i.e., micrographs) enables and necessitates a more powerful and automated framework to extract materials characteristics and knowledge. The framework we propose can be used to gradually build a database of microstructure classes relevant to a particular process or group of materials, which can help in analyzing and discovering/identifying new materials. The framework has three steps: (1) segmentation of multiphase micrographs through a recently developed score-based method so that different microstructure homogeneous regions can be identified in an unsupervised manner; (2) {identification and classification of} homogeneous regions of micrographs through an uncertainty-aware supervised classification network trained using the segmented micrographs from Step $1$ with their identified labels verified via the built-in uncertainty quantification and minimal human inspection; (3) supervised segmentation (more powerful than the segmentation in Step $1$) of multiphase microstructures through a segmentation network trained with micrographs and the results from Steps $1$-$2$ using a form of data augmentation. This framework can iteratively characterize/segment new homogeneous or multiphase materials while expanding the database to enhance performance. The framework is demonstrated on various sets of materials and texture images.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07117">Choroidal image analysis for OCT image sequences with applications in systemic health</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Burke</p>
<p>Abstract: The choroid, a highly vascular layer behind the retina, is an extension of the central nervous system and has parallels with the renal cortex, with blood flow far exceeding that of the brain and kidney. Thus, there has been growing interest of choroidal blood flow reflecting physiological status of systemic disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution imaging of the choroid, but conventional analysis methods remain manual or semi-automatic, limiting reproducibility, standardisation and clinical utility. In this thesis, I develop several new methods to analyse the choroid in OCT image sequences, with each successive method improving on its predecessors. I first develop two semi-automatic approaches for choroid region (Gaussian Process Edge Tracing, GPET) and vessel (Multi-scale Median Cut Quantisation, MMCQ) analysis, which improve on manual approaches but remain user-dependent. To address this, I introduce DeepGPET, a deep learning-based region segmentation method which improves on execution time, reproducibility, and end-user accessibility, but lacks choroid vessel analysis and automatic feature measurement. Improving on this, I developed Choroidalyzer, a deep learning-based pipeline to segment the choroidal space and vessels and generate fully automatic, clinically meaningful and reproducible choroidal features. I provide rigorous evaluation of these four approaches and consider their potential clinical value in three applications into systemic health: OCTANE, assessing choroidal changes in renal transplant recipients and donors; PREVENT, exploring choroidal associations with Alzheimer's risk factors at mid-life; D-RISCii, assessing choroidal variation and feasibility of OCT in critical care. In short, this thesis contributes many open-source tools for standardised choroidal measurement and highlights the choroid's potential as a biomarker in systemic health.</p>

We propose Tab2Visual, a novel approach that transforms heterogeneous tabular data into visual representations, enabling the application of powerful deep learning models. Tab2Visual effectively addresses data scarcity by incorporating novel image augmentation techniques and facilitating transfer learning. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach on diverse tabular datasets, comparing its performance against a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including classical methods, tree-based ensembles, and state-of-the-art deep learning models specifically designed for tabular data. We also perform an in-depth analysis of factors influencing Tab2Visual's performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that Tab2Visual outperforms other methods in classification problems with limited tabular data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Shah, Atsushi Fukuda, Quan Huu Cap</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge, particularly for images with varying color distributions and qualities. Previous approaches often struggle when models trained on high-quality images fail to generalize to low-quality test images due to these color and quality shifts. In this work, we propose two novel techniques to enhance generalization: dynamic color image normalization (DCIN) module and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss. The DCIN dynamically normalizes the color of test images using two reference image selection strategies. Specifically, the DCIN utilizes a global reference image selection (GRIS), which finds a universal reference image, and a local reference image selection (LRIS), which selects a semantically similar reference image per test sample. Additionally, CQG loss enforces invariance to color and quality variations by ensuring consistent segmentation predictions across transformed image pairs. Experimental results show that our proposals significantly improve segmentation performance over the baseline on two target domain datasets, despite being trained solely on a single source domain. Notably, our model achieved up to a 32.3-point increase in Dice score compared to the baseline, consistently producing robust and usable results even under substantial domain shifts. Our work contributes to the development of more robust medical image segmentation models that generalize across unseen domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> GaoFei Zhu, GangHua Lin, Xiao Yang, Cheng Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun, and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data. Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention (CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk H$\alpha$ images. Feature information from each network layer is fully extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer, significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design. Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as open-source resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuechen Xie, Jie Song, Mengqi Xue, Haofei Zhang, Xingen Wang, Bingde Hu, Genlang Chen, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets, which necessitate substantial efforts for curation, has become the primary catalyst for the swift progress of deep learning. Concurrently, protecting these datasets is paramount for the well-being of the data owner. Dataset ownership verification emerges as a crucial method in this domain, but existing approaches are often limited to supervised models and cannot be directly extended to increasingly popular unsupervised pre-trained models. In this work, we propose the first dataset ownership verification method tailored specifically for self-supervised pre-trained models by contrastive learning. Its primary objective is to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box backbone has been pre-trained on a specific unlabeled dataset, aiding dataset owners in upholding their rights. The proposed approach is motivated by our empirical insights that when models are trained with the target dataset, the unary and binary instance relationships within the embedding space exhibit significant variations compared to models trained without the target dataset. We validate the efficacy of this approach across multiple contrastive pre-trained models including SimCLR, BYOL, SimSiam, MOCO v3, and DINO. The results demonstrate that our method rejects the null hypothesis with a $p$-value markedly below $0.05$, surpassing all previous methodologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Gao, Liang Pang, Shicheng Xu, Leigang Qu, Tat-Seng Chua, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), the creation of high-quality AI-generated videos has become faster and easier, resulting in the Internet being flooded with all kinds of video content. However, the impact of these videos on the content ecosystem remains largely unexplored. Video information retrieval remains a fundamental approach for accessing video content. Building on the observation that retrieval models often favor AI-generated content in ad-hoc and image retrieval tasks, we investigate whether similar biases emerge in the context of challenging video retrieval, where temporal and visual factors may further influence model behavior. To explore this, we first construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing both real and AI-generated videos, along with a set of fair and rigorous metrics to assess bias. This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by two state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously design a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference, accounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and suboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video retrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our findings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval. Further investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the training set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference observed in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from both unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video bias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we fine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The results of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated videos on retrieval systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video microscopy, when combined with machine learning, offers a promising approach for studying the early development of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. However, manually annotating developmental events, and more specifically cell divisions, is time-consuming for a biologist and cannot scale up for practical applications. We aim to automatically classify the cell stages of embryos from 2D time-lapse microscopy videos with a deep learning approach. We focus on the analysis of bovine embryonic development using video microscopy, as we are primarily interested in the application of cattle breeding, and we have created a Bovine Embryos Cell Stages (ECS) dataset. The challenges are three-fold: (1) low-quality images and bovine dark cells that make the identification of cell stages difficult, (2) class ambiguity at the boundaries of developmental stages, and (3) imbalanced data distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce CLEmbryo, a novel method that leverages supervised contrastive learning combined with focal loss for training, and the lightweight 3D neural network CSN-50 as an encoder. We also show that our method generalizes well. CLEmbryo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both our Bovine ECS dataset and the publicly available NYU Mouse Embryos dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahana Yadnakudige Subramanya, Ko Watanabe, Andreas Dengel, Shoya Ishimaru</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) frameworks are increasingly recognized for their potential to improve annotation accuracy in emotion estimation systems by combining machine predictions with human expertise. This study focuses on integrating a high-performing image-based emotion model into a HITL annotation framework to evaluate the collaborative potential of human-machine interaction and identify the psychological and practical factors critical to successful collaboration. Specifically, we investigate how varying model reliability and cognitive framing influence human trust, cognitive load, and annotation behavior in HITL systems. We demonstrate that model reliability and psychological framing significantly impact annotators' trust, engagement, and consistency, offering insights into optimizing HITL frameworks. Through three experimental scenarios with 29 participants--baseline model reliability (S1), fabricated errors (S2), and cognitive bias introduced by negative framing (S3)--we analyzed behavioral and qualitative data. Reliable predictions in S1 yielded high trust and annotation consistency, while unreliable outputs in S2 led to increased critical evaluations but also heightened frustration and response variability. Negative framing in S3 revealed how cognitive bias influenced participants to perceive the model as more relatable and accurate, despite misinformation regarding its reliability. These findings highlight the importance of both reliable machine outputs and psychological factors in shaping effective human-machine collaboration. By leveraging the strengths of both human oversight and automated systems, this study establishes a scalable HITL framework for emotion annotation and lays the foundation for broader applications in adaptive learning and human-computer interaction.</p>

The method requires no training data or optimization and can be carried out via common exploits software, firmware or hardware based attack vectors. An enhanced variant that uses a single forward and backward pass further amplifies the damage beyond DNL's zero-pass approach. Flipping just two sign bits in ResNet50 on ImageNet reduces accuracy by 99.8\%. We also show that selectively protecting a small fraction of vulnerable sign bits provides a practical defense against such attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lotfi Abdelkrim Mecharbat, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique, Mohammad M. Ghassemi, Tuka Alhanai</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a surge in optimizing edge Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for accuracy and efficiency using traditional optimization techniques such as pruning, and more recently, employing automatic design methodologies. However, the focus of these design techniques has often overlooked critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and generalization. As a result, when evaluating SOTA edge DNNs' performance in image classification using the FACET dataset, we found that they exhibit significant accuracy disparities (14.09%) across 10 different skin tones, alongside issues of non-robustness and poor generalizability. In response to these observations, we introduce Mixture-of-Experts-based Neural Architecture Search (MoENAS), an automatic design technique that navigates through a space of mixture of experts to discover accurate, fair, robust, and general edge DNNs. MoENAS improves the accuracy by 4.02% compared to SOTA edge DNNs and reduces the skin tone accuracy disparities from 14.09% to 5.60%, while enhancing robustness by 3.80% and minimizing overfitting to 0.21%, all while keeping model size close to state-of-the-art models average size (+0.4M). With these improvements, MoENAS establishes a new benchmark for edge DNN design, paving the way for the development of more inclusive and robust edge DNNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) tailors models to clients' unique data distributions while preserving privacy. However, existing aggregation-weight-based PFL methods often struggle with heterogeneous data, facing challenges in accuracy, computational efficiency, and communication overhead. We propose FedAPA, a novel PFL method featuring a server-side, gradient-based adaptive aggregation strategy to generate personalized models, by updating aggregation weights based on gradients of client-parameter changes with respect to the aggregation weights in a centralized manner. FedAPA guarantees theoretical convergence and achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to 10 PFL competitors across three datasets, with competitive communication overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxia Sun, Huihong Chen, Jingcai Guo, Aoxiang Sun, Zhetao Li, Haolin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Attributing APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) malware to their respective groups is crucial for threat intelligence and cybersecurity. However, APT adversaries often conceal their identities, rendering attribution inherently adversarial. Existing machine learning-based attribution models, while effective, remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For example, the state-of-the-art byte-level model MalConv sees its accuracy drop from over 90% to below 2% under PGD (projected gradient descent) attacks. Existing gradient-based adversarial training techniques for malware detection or image processing were applied to malware attribution in this study, revealing that both robustness and training efficiency require significant improvement. To address this, we propose RoMA, a novel single-step adversarial training approach that integrates global perturbations to generate enhanced adversarial samples and employs adversarial consistency regularization to improve representation quality and resilience. A novel APT malware dataset named AMG18, with diverse samples and realistic class imbalances, is introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that RoMA significantly outperforms seven competing methods in both adversarial robustness (e.g., achieving over 80% robust accuracy-more than twice that of the next-best method under PGD attacks) and training efficiency (e.g., more than twice as fast as the second-best method in terms of accuracy), while maintaining superior standard accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oona Rainio, Maria K. Jaakkola, Riku Kl\'en</p>
<p>Abstract: Background. Recently, dynamic total-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become possible due to new scanner devices. While clustering algorithms have been proposed for PET analysis already earlier, there is still little research systematically evaluating these algorithms for processing of dynamic total-body PET images. Materials and methods. Here, we compare the performance of 15 unsupervised clustering methods, including K-means either by itself or after principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), fuzzy c-means (FCM), agglomerative clustering, spectral clustering, and several newer clustering algorithms, for classifying time activity curves (TACs) in dynamic PET images. We use dynamic total-body $^{15}$O-water PET images collected from 30 patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease. To evaluate the clustering algorithms in a quantitative way, we use them to classify 5000 TACs from each image based on whether the curve is taken from brain, right heart ventricle, right kidney, lower right lung lobe, or urinary bladder. Results. According to our results, the best methods are GMM, FCM, and ICA combined with mini batch K-means, which classified the TACs with a median accuracies of 89\%, 83\%, and 81\%, respectively, in a processing time of half a second or less on average for each image. Conclusion. GMM, FCM, and ICA with mini batch K-means show promise for dynamic total-body PET analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raman Dutt</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study adopts a data-driven approach and presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals an unexpected finding: prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures are among the most memorized, with de-identification markers contributing the most. Furthermore, we also find existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens highlighting a broader issue in T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. On this front, we propose actionable strategies to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichuan Lin, Yilin Ye, Jiazhi Xia, Wei Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models can generate visually appealing images from text descriptions. Efforts have been devoted to improving model controls with prompt tuning and spatial conditioning. However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users' rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Tan, Yuetao Chen, Yimin Jiang, Xing Chen, Kun Yan, Nan Duan, Yibo Zhu, Daxin Jiang, Hong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown remarkable performance in modeling and generating high-quality videos. However, the quadratic computational complexity of 3D full attention mechanism presents significant challenges in scaling video DiT training, especially for high-definition and lengthy videos, where attention can dominate up to 95% of the end-to-end time and necessitate specialized communication paradigms to handle large input sizes.
  This paper introduces DSV, a novel framework designed to accelerate and scale the training of video DiTs by leveraging the inherent dynamic attention sparsity throughout the training process. DSV employs a two-stage training algorithm that exploits sparsity patterns, focusing on critical elements supported by efficient, tailored kernels. To accommodate the new sparsity dimension, we develop a hybrid sparsity-aware context parallelism that effectively scales to large inputs by addressing the heterogeneity of sparsity across attention heads and blocks, resulting in optimized sparse computation and communication. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DSV achieves up to 3.02x gain in training throughput with nearly no quality degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Yang, Jie Lu, En Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of large-scale contrastive pre-training propelled by top-tier datasets has reached a transition point in the scaling law. Consequently, sustaining and enhancing a model's pre-training capabilities in drift environments have surfaced as a notable challenge. In this paper, we initially uncover that contrastive pre-training methods are significantly impacted by concept drift wherein distributions change unpredictably, resulting in notable biases in the feature space of the pre-trained model. Empowered by causal inference, we construct a structural causal graph to analyze the impact of concept drift to contrastive pre-training systemically, and propose the causal interventional contrastive objective. Upon achieving this, we devise a resilient contrastive pre-training approach to accommodate the data stream of concept drift, with simple and scalable implementation. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate our resilient contrastive pre-training effectively mitigates the bias stemming from the concept drift data stream.

<p>Abstract: Progress in AI has relied on human-generated data, from annotator marketplaces to the wider Internet. However, the widespread use of large language models now threatens the quality and integrity of human-generated data on these very platforms. We argue that this issue goes beyond the immediate challenge of filtering AI-generated content--it reveals deeper flaws in how data collection systems are designed. Existing systems often prioritize speed, scale, and efficiency at the cost of intrinsic human motivation, leading to declining engagement and data quality. We propose that rethinking data collection systems to align with contributors' intrinsic motivations--rather than relying solely on external incentives--can help sustain high-quality data sourcing at scale while maintaining contributor trust and long-term participation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafa{\l} Tobiasz, Grzegorz Wilczy\'nski, Marcin Mazur, S{\l}awomir Tadeja, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a recent and pivotal technique in 3D computer graphics. GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Ahmed Hashmi, Aigerim Zhumabayeva, Nikita Kotelevskii, Artem Agafonov, Mohammad Yaqub, Maxim Panov, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models significantly depends on the quality of provided annotations. In medical image segmentation, for example, having multiple expert annotations for each data point is common to minimize subjective annotation bias. Then, the goal of estimation is to filter out the label noise and recover the ground-truth masks, which are not explicitly given. This paper proposes a probabilistic model for noisy observations that allows us to build a confident classification and segmentation models. To accomplish it, we explicitly model label noise and introduce a new information-based regularization that pushes the network to recover the ground-truth labels. In addition, for segmentation task we adjust the loss function by prioritizing learning in high-confidence regions where all the annotators agree on labeling. We evaluate the proposed method on a series of classification tasks such as noisy versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST datasets as well as CIFAR-10N, which is real-world dataset with noisy human annotations. Additionally, for segmentation task, we consider several medical imaging datasets, such as, LIDC and RIGA that reflect real-world inter-variability among multiple annotators. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for the considered classification and segmentation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taorong Liu, Liang Liao, Delin Chen, Jing Xiao, Zheng Wang, Chia-Wen Lin, Shin'ichi Satoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wojciech Zielonka, Timur Bagautdinov, Shunsuke Saito, Michael Zollh\"ofer, Justus Thies, Javier Romero</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars (D3GA), a multi-layered 3D controllable model for human bodies that utilizes 3D Gaussian primitives embedded into tetrahedral cages. The advantage of using cages compared to commonly employed linear blend skinning (LBS) is that primitives like 3D Gaussians are naturally re-oriented and their kernels are stretched via the deformation gradients of the encapsulating tetrahedron. Additional offsets are modeled for the tetrahedron vertices, effectively decoupling the low-dimensional driving poses from the extensive set of primitives to be rendered. This separation is achieved through the localized influence of each tetrahedron on 3D Gaussians, resulting in improved optimization. Using the cage-based deformation model, we introduce a compositional pipeline that decomposes an avatar into layers, such as garments, hands, or faces, improving the modeling of phenomena like garment sliding. These parts can be conditioned on different driving signals, such as keypoints for facial expressions or joint-angle vectors for garments and the body. Our experiments on two multi-view datasets with varied body shapes, clothes, and motions show higher-quality results. They surpass PSNR and SSIM metrics of other SOTA methods using the same data while offering greater flexibility and compactness.</p>

Current solutions using convolutional neural networks require large amounts of computational resources, leading to high power consumption. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an alternative computational model to process information and make decisions. This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles. The efficacy and generalizability of the method will be investigated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Young Kim, Hyojun Go, Soonwoo Kwon, Hyun-Gyoon Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of generative modeling. Despite extensive research on denoising across various timesteps and noise levels, a conflict persists regarding the relative difficulties of the denoising tasks. While various studies argue that lower timesteps present more challenging tasks, others contend that higher timesteps are more difficult. To address this conflict, our study undertakes a comprehensive examination of task difficulties, focusing on convergence behavior and changes in relative entropy between consecutive probability distributions across timesteps. Our observational study reveals that denoising at earlier timesteps poses challenges characterized by slower convergence and higher relative entropy, indicating increased task difficulty at these lower timesteps. Building on these observations, we introduce an easy-to-hard learning scheme, drawing from curriculum learning, to enhance the training process of diffusion models. By organizing timesteps or noise levels into clusters and training models with ascending orders of difficulty, we facilitate an order-aware training regime, progressing from easier to harder denoising tasks, thereby deviating from the conventional approach of training diffusion models simultaneously across all timesteps. Our approach leads to improved performance and faster convergence by leveraging benefits of curriculum learning, while maintaining orthogonality with existing improvements in diffusion training techniques. We validate these advantages through comprehensive experiments in image generation tasks, including unconditional, class-conditional, and text-to-image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces BioVL-QR, a biochemical vision-and-language dataset comprising 23 egocentric experiment videos, corresponding protocols, and vision-and-language alignments. A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding. Data and code are available through https://nishi10mo.github.io/BioVL-QR/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Poulami Sinhamahapatra, Franziska Schwaiger, Shirsha Bose, Huiyu Wang, Karsten Roscher, Stephan Guennemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and localising unknown or out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in any scene can be a challenging task in vision, particularly in safety-critical cases involving autonomous systems like automated vehicles or trains. Supervised anomaly segmentation or open-world object detection models depend on training on exhaustively annotated datasets for every domain and still struggle in distinguishing between background and OOD objects. In this work, we present a plug-and-play framework - PRototype-based OOD detection Without Labels (PROWL). It is an inference-based method that does not require training on the domain dataset and relies on extracting relevant features from self-supervised pre-trained models. PROWL can be easily adapted to detect in-domain objects in any operational design domain (ODD) in a zero-shot manner by specifying a list of known classes from this domain. PROWL, as a first zero-shot unsupervised method, achieves state-of-the-art results on the RoadAnomaly and RoadObstacle datasets provided in road driving benchmarks - SegmentMeIfYouCan (SMIYC) and Fishyscapes, as well as comparable performance against existing supervised methods trained without auxiliary OOD data. We also demonstrate its generalisability to other domains such as rail and maritime.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. The synthetic images are validated by expert clinicians for alignment with their corresponding text prompts. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the synthetic images against the real images confirms that our model synthesizes novel images and, crucially, may preserve patient privacy. Finally, classifiers trained on a mixture of synthetic and real data achieve similar performance to those trained on twice the amount of real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential for generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raman Dutt, Ondrej Bohdal, Pedro Sanchez, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Timothy Hospedales</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generating images that closely resemble their training data but are also susceptible to data memorization, raising privacy, ethical, and legal concerns, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical imaging. We hypothesize that this memorization stems from the overparameterization of deep models and propose that regularizing model capacity during fine-tuning can mitigate this issue. Firstly, we empirically show that regulating the model capacity via Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mitigates memorization to some extent, however, it further requires the identification of the exact parameter subsets to be fine-tuned for high-quality generation. To identify these subsets, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework, MemControl, that automates parameter selection using memorization and generation quality metrics as rewards during fine-tuning. The parameter subsets discovered through MemControl achieve a superior tradeoff between generation quality and memorization. For the task of medical image generation, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art memorization mitigation strategies by fine-tuning as few as 0.019% of model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the discovered parameter subsets are transferable to non-medical domains. Our framework is scalable to large datasets, agnostic to reward functions, and can be integrated with existing approaches for further memorization mitigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically evaluate memorization in medical images and propose a targeted yet universal mitigation strategy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ye, Shreyank N. Gowda, Xiaowei Huang, Haotian Xu, Yaochu Jin, Kaizhu Huang, Xiaobo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable classifiers to identify unseen classes. This is typically achieved by generating visual features for unseen classes based on learned visual-semantic correlations from seen classes. However, most current generative approaches heavily rely on having a sufficient number of samples from seen classes. Our study reveals that a scarcity of seen class samples results in a marked decrease in performance across many generative ZSL techniques. We argue, quantify, and empirically demonstrate that this decline is largely attributable to spurious visual-semantic correlations. To address this issue, we introduce ZeroDiff, an innovative generative framework for ZSL that incorporates diffusion mechanisms and contrastive representations to enhance visual-semantic correlations. ZeroDiff comprises three key components: (1) Diffusion augmentation, which naturally transforms limited data into an expanded set of noised data to mitigate generative model overfitting; (2) Supervised-contrastive (SC)-based representations that dynamically characterize each limited sample to support visual feature generation; and (3) Multiple feature discriminators employing a Wasserstein-distance-based mutual learning approach, evaluating generated features from various perspectives, including pre-defined semantics, SC-based representations, and the diffusion process. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroDiff not only achieves significant improvements over existing ZSL methods but also maintains robust performance even with scarce training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> X. Wang, Siming Fu, Qihan Huang, Wanggui He, Hao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation models have dramatically enhanced the generation of photorealistic images from textual prompts, leading to an increased interest in personalized text-to-image applications, particularly in multi-subject scenarios. However, these advances are hindered by two main challenges: firstly, the need to accurately maintain the details of each referenced subject in accordance with the textual descriptions; and secondly, the difficulty in achieving a cohesive representation of multiple subjects in a single image without introducing inconsistencies. To address these concerns, our research introduces the MS-Diffusion framework for layout-guided zero-shot image personalization with multi-subjects. This innovative approach integrates grounding tokens with the feature resampler to maintain detail fidelity among subjects. With the layout guidance, MS-Diffusion further improves the cross-attention to adapt to the multi-subject inputs, ensuring that each subject condition acts on specific areas. The proposed multi-subject cross-attention orchestrates harmonious inter-subject compositions while preserving the control of texts. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm that this method surpasses existing models in both image and text fidelity, promoting the development of personalized text-to-image generation.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12042">Not All Prompts Are Made Equal: Prompt-based Pruning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Ganjdanesh, Reza Shirkavand, Shangqian Gao, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive image generation capabilities. Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g. prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Ma, Rongrong Lian, Zhenkai Wu, Hongbo Guo, Mengting Ma, Sensen Wu, Zhenhong Du, Siyang Song, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing images usually characterized by complex backgrounds, scale and orientation variations, and large intra-class variance. General semantic segmentation methods usually fail to fully investigate the above issues, and thus their performances on remote sensing image segmentation are limited. In this paper, we propose our LOGCAN++, a semantic segmentation model customized for remote sensing images, which is made up of a Global Class Awareness (GCA) module and several Local Class Awareness (LCA) modules. The GCA module captures global representations for class-level context modeling to reduce the interference of background noise. The LCA module generates local class representations as intermediate perceptual elements to indirectly associate pixels with the global class representations, targeting at dealing with the large intra-class variance problem. In particular, we introduce affine transformations in the LCA module for adaptive extraction of local class representations to effectively tolerate scale and orientation variations in remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our LOGCAN++ outperforms current mainstream general and remote sensing semantic segmentation methods and achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangyuan Guo, Wei Chen, Yuxuan Sun, Jialong Xu, Bo Ai</p>
<p>Abstract: Although semantic communication (SC) has shown its potential in efficiently transmitting multimodal data such as texts, speeches and images, SC for videos has focused primarily on pixel-level reconstruction. However, these SC systems may be suboptimal for downstream intelligent tasks. Moreover, SC systems without pixel-level video reconstruction present advantages by achieving higher bandwidth efficiency and real-time performance of various intelligent tasks. The difficulty in such system design lies in the extraction of task-related compact semantic representations and their accurate delivery over noisy channels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SC system, named VideoQA-SC for video question answering (VideoQA) tasks. Our goal is to accomplish VideoQA tasks directly based on video semantics over noisy or fading wireless channels, bypassing the need for video reconstruction at the receiver. To this end, we develop a spatiotemporal semantic encoder for effective video semantic extraction, and a learning-based bandwidth-adaptive deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) scheme for efficient and robust video semantic transmission. Experiments demonstrate that VideoQA-SC outperforms traditional and advanced DJSCC-based SC systems that rely on video reconstruction at the receiver under a wide range of channel conditions and bandwidth constraints. In particular, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, VideoQA-SC can improve the answer accuracy by 5.17% while saving almost 99.5\% of the bandwidth at the same time, compared with the advanced DJSCC-based SC system. Our results show the great potential of SC system design for video applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitian Zhang, Xu Ma, Yue Bai, Huan Wang, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision foundation models are renowned for the generalization ability due to massive training data. Nevertheless, they demand tremendous training resources, and the training data is often inaccessible, e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, posing great challenges to developing derivatives that could facilitate the research. In this work, we offer a very simple and general solution, named \textit{Proteus}, to distill foundation models into smaller equivalents on ImageNet-1K without access to the original training data. Specifically, we remove the designs from conventional knowledge distillation settings that result in dataset bias and present three levels of training objectives, i.e., token, patch, and feature, to maximize the efficacy of knowledge transfer. In this manner, Proteus is trained at ImageNet-level costs with surprising ability, facilitating the accessibility of training foundation models for the broader research community. When leveraging DINOv2-g/14 as the teacher, Proteus-L/14 matches the performance of the Oracle method DINOv2-L/14 (142M training data) across 19 benchmarks and outperforms other vision foundation models including CLIP-L/14 (400M), OpenCLIP-L/14 (400M/2B) and SynCLR-L/14 (600M) with a significantly smaller training set of 1.2M images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwook Kim, Seonho Lee, Jaeyo Shin, Jiho Choi, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vito Mengers, Nicolas Roth, Oliver Brock, Klaus Obermayer, Martin Rolfs</p>
<p>Abstract: The objects we perceive guide our eye movements when observing real-world dynamic scenes. Yet, gaze shifts and selective attention are critical for perceiving details and refining object boundaries. Object segmentation and gaze behavior are, however, typically treated as two independent processes. Here, we present a computational model that simulates these processes in an interconnected manner and allows for hypothesis-driven investigations of distinct attentional mechanisms. Drawing on an information processing pattern from robotics, we use a Bayesian filter to recursively segment the scene, which also provides an uncertainty estimate for the object boundaries that we use to guide active scene exploration. We demonstrate that this model closely resembles observers' free viewing behavior on a dataset of dynamic real-world scenes, measured by scanpath statistics, including foveation duration and saccade amplitude distributions used for parameter fitting and higher-level statistics not used for fitting. These include how object detections, inspections, and returns are balanced and a delay of returning saccades without an explicit implementation of such temporal inhibition of return. Extensive simulations and ablation studies show that uncertainty promotes balanced exploration and that semantic object cues are crucial to forming the perceptual units used in object-based attention. Moreover, we show how our model's modular design allows for extensions, such as incorporating saccadic momentum or pre-saccadic attention, to further align its output with human scanpaths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hefei Mei, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated great potential in the field of adversarial robustness, where DM-based defense methods can achieve superior defense capability without adversarial training. However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentinos Pariza, Mohammadreza Salehi, Gertjan Burghouts, Francesco Locatello, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel self-supervised training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model. Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e., 'attract' and 'repel', this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches. Our method leverages differentiable sorting applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. This method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establishes several new state-of-the-art results such as +5.5% and +6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff and improvements in the 3D understanding of multi-view consistency on SPair-71k, by more than 1.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunwoo Kim, Itai Lang, Noam Aigerman, Thibault Groueix, Vladimir G. Kim, Rana Hanocka</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose MeshUp, a technique that deforms a 3D mesh towards multiple target concepts, and intuitively controls the region where each concept is expressed. Conveniently, the concepts can be defined as either text queries, e.g., "a dog" and "a turtle," or inspirational images, and the local regions can be selected as any number of vertices on the mesh. We can effectively control the influence of the concepts and mix them together using a novel score distillation approach, referred to as the Blended Score Distillation (BSD). BSD operates on each attention layer of the denoising U-Net of a diffusion model as it extracts and injects the per-objective activations into a unified denoising pipeline from which the deformation gradients are calculated. To localize the expression of these activations, we create a probabilistic Region of Interest (ROI) map on the surface of the mesh, and turn it into 3D-consistent masks that we use to control the expression of these activations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BSD empirically and show that it can deform various meshes towards multiple objectives. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/MeshUp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Liu, Luping Ji, Jiaxiang Gou, Bo Fu, Mao Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathology Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) provide an important tool to assess cancer prognosis in computational pathology (CPATH). While existing survival analysis (SA) approaches have made exciting progress, they are generally limited to adopting highly-expressive network architectures and only coarse-grained patient-level labels to learn visual prognostic representations from gigapixel WSIs. Such learning paradigm suffers from critical performance bottlenecks, when facing present scarce training data and standard multi-instance learning (MIL) framework in CPATH. To overcome it, this paper, for the first time, proposes a new Vision-Language-based SA (VLSA) paradigm. Concretely, (1) VLSA is driven by pathology VL foundation models. It no longer relies on high-capability networks and shows the advantage of data efficiency. (2) In vision-end, VLSA encodes textual prognostic prior and then employs it as auxiliary signals to guide the aggregating of visual prognostic features at instance level, thereby compensating for the weak supervision in MIL. Moreover, given the characteristics of SA, we propose i) ordinal survival prompt learning to transform continuous survival labels into textual prompts; and ii) ordinal incidence function as prediction target to make SA compatible with VL-based prediction. Notably, VLSA's predictions can be interpreted intuitively by our Shapley values-based method. The extensive experiments on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our scheme. Our VLSA could pave a new way for SA in CPATH by offering weakly-supervised MIL an effective means to learn valuable prognostic clues from gigapixel WSIs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolong Qian, Qi Jiang, Yao Gao, Shaohua Gao, Zhonghua Yi, Lei Sun, Kai Wei, Haifeng Li, Kailun Yang, Kaiwei Wang, Jian Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution. To address the depth-varying optical degradation, we introduce a Depth-aware Degradation-adaptive Training (DA2T) scheme. At the dataset level, a Depth-aware Aberration MOS (DAMOS) dataset is established based on the simulation of Point Spread Functions (PSFs) under different object distances. Additionally, we design two plug-and-play depth-aware mechanisms to embed depth information into the aberration image recovery for better tackling depth-aware degradation. Furthermore, we propose a storage-efficient Omni-Lens-Field model to represent the 4D PSF library of various lenses. With the predicted depth map, recovered image, and depth-aware PSF map inferred by Omni-Lens-Field, single-lens controllable DoF imaging is achieved. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the recovery performance, and attains impressive single-lens controllable DoF imaging results, providing a seminal baseline for this field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunal Chelani, Assia Benbihi, Fredrik Kahl, Torsten Sattler, Zuzana Kukelova</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid growth in the popularity of AR/VR/MR applications and cloud-based visual localization systems has given rise to an increased focus on the privacy of user content in the localization process. This privacy concern has been further escalated by the ability of deep neural networks to recover detailed images of a scene from a sparse set of 3D or 2D points and their descriptors - the so-called inversion attacks. Research on privacy-preserving localization has therefore focused on preventing these inversion attacks on both the query image keypoints and the 3D points of the scene map. To this end, several geometry obfuscation techniques that lift points to higher-dimensional spaces, i.e., lines or planes, or that swap coordinates between points % have been proposed. In this paper, we point to a common weakness of these obfuscations that allows to recover approximations of the original point positions under the assumption of known neighborhoods. We further show that these neighborhoods can be computed by learning to identify descriptors that co-occur in neighborhoods. Extensive experiments show that our approach for point recovery is practically applicable to all existing geometric obfuscation schemes. Our results show that these schemes should not be considered privacy-preserving, even though they are claimed to be privacy-preserving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunal Chelani, Assia Benbihi, Torsten Sattler, Fredrik Kahl</p>
<p>Abstract: With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchang Shen, Zhaoshuo Li, Marc Law, Matan Atzmon, Sanja Fidler, James Lucas, Jun Gao, Nicholas Sharp</p>
<p>Abstract: Meshes are ubiquitous in visual computing and simulation, yet most existing machine learning techniques represent meshes only indirectly, e.g. as the level set of a scalar field or deformation of a template, or as a disordered triangle soup lacking local structure. This work presents a scheme to directly generate manifold, polygonal meshes of complex connectivity as the output of a neural network. Our key innovation is to define a continuous latent connectivity space at each mesh vertex, which implies the discrete mesh. In particular, our vertex embeddings generate cyclic neighbor relationships in a halfedge mesh representation, which gives a guarantee of edge-manifoldness and the ability to represent general polygonal meshes. This representation is well-suited to machine learning and stochastic optimization, without restriction on connectivity or topology. We first explore the basic properties of this representation, then use it to fit distributions of meshes from large datasets. The resulting models generate diverse meshes with tessellation structure learned from the dataset population, with concise details and high-quality mesh elements. In applications, this approach not only yields high-quality outputs from generative models, but also enables directly learning challenging geometry processing tasks such as mesh repair.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shadows can originate from occlusions in both direct and indirect illumination. Although most current shadow removal research focuses on shadows caused by direct illumination, shadows from indirect illumination are often just as pervasive, particularly in indoor scenes. A significant challenge in removing shadows from indirect illumination is obtaining shadow-free images to train the shadow removal network. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel rendering pipeline for generating shadowed and shadow-free images under direct and indirect illumination, and create a comprehensive synthetic dataset that contains over 30,000 image pairs, covering various object types and lighting conditions. We also propose an innovative shadow removal network that explicitly integrates semantic and geometric priors through concatenation and attention mechanisms. The experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shadow removal techniques and can effectively generalize to indoor and outdoor scenes under various lighting conditions, enhancing the overall effectiveness and applicability of shadow removal methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Jiang, Anish Kachinthaya, Suzie Petryk, Yossi Gandelsman</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the internal representations of vision-language models (VLMs) to address hallucinations, a persistent challenge despite advances in model size and training. We project VLMs' internal image representations to their language vocabulary and observe more confident output probabilities on real objects than hallucinated objects. We additionally use these output probabilities to spatially localize real objects. Building on this approach, we introduce a knowledge erasure algorithm that removes hallucinations by linearly orthogonalizing image features with respect to hallucinated object features. We show that targeted edits to a model's latent representations can reduce hallucinations by up to 25.7% on the COCO2014 dataset while preserving performance. Our findings demonstrate how a deeper understanding of VLMs' latent representations can enhance reliability and enable novel capabilities, such as zero-shot segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuto Haneji, Taichi Nishimura, Hirotaka Kameko, Keisuke Shirai, Tomoya Yoshida, Keiya Kajimura, Koki Yamamoto, Taiyu Cui, Tomohiro Nishimoto, Shinsuke Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: Mistake action detection is crucial for developing intelligent archives that detect workers' errors and provide feedback. Existing studies have focused on visually apparent mistakes in free-style activities, resulting in video-only approaches to mistake detection. However, in text-following activities, models cannot determine the correctness of some actions without referring to the texts. Additionally, current mistake datasets rarely use procedural texts for video recording except for cooking. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes the EgoOops dataset, where egocentric videos record erroneous activities when following procedural texts across diverse domains. It features three types of annotations: video-text alignment, mistake labels, and descriptions for mistakes. We also propose a mistake detection approach, combining video-text alignment and mistake label classification to leverage the texts. Our experimental results show that incorporating procedural texts is essential for mistake detection. Data is available through https://y-haneji.github.io/EgoOops-project-page/.</p>

We develop a novel method that encodes geometrical-topological characteristics of point clouds using inner products, leading to a highly-efficient point cloud representation with provable expressivity properties.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, a robust method for 3D pose estimation of immature green apples (fruitlets) in commercial orchards was developed, utilizing the YOLO11(or YOLOv11) object detection and pose estimation algorithm alongside Vision Transformers (ViT) for depth estimation (Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) and Depth Anything V2). For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Lin, Danfeng Hong, Shuhang Ge, Chuyao Luo, Kai Jiang, Hao Jin, Congcong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) presents unique challenges and plays a critical role in applications. Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs, efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Svitov, Pietro Morerio, Lourdes Agapito, Alessio Del Bue</p>
<p>Abstract: We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for 3D scene representation based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), preserving the accurate mesh extraction ability of 2D primitives. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Israt Zarin Era, Fan Zhou, Ahmed Shoyeb Raihan, Imtiaz Ahmed, Alan Abul-Haj, James Craig, Srinjoy Das, Zhichao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Directed Energy Deposition (DED) offers significant potential for manufacturing complex and multi-material parts. However, internal defects such as porosity and cracks can compromise mechanical properties and overall performance. This study focuses on in-situ monitoring and characterization of melt pools associated with porosity, aiming to improve defect detection and quality control in DED-printed parts. Traditional machine learning approaches for defect identification rely on extensive labeled datasets, often scarce and expensive to generate in real-world manufacturing. To address this, our framework employs self-supervised learning on unlabeled melt pool data using a Vision Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to produce highly representative embeddings. These fine-tuned embeddings are leveraged via transfer learning to train classifiers on a limited labeled dataset, enabling the effective identification of melt pool anomalies. We evaluate two classifiers: (1) a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier utilizing the fine-tuned MAE Encoder's parameters and (2) the fine-tuned MAE Encoder combined with an MLP classifier head. Our framework achieves overall accuracy ranging from 95.44% to 99.17% and an average F1 score exceeding 80%, with the ViT Classifier slightly outperforming the MAE Encoder Classifier. This demonstrates the scalability and cost-effectiveness of our approach for automated quality control in DED, effectively detecting defects with minimal labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Chen, Tingzhu Chen, Wenjun Zhang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce OBI-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate large multi-modal models (LMMs) on whole-process oracle bone inscriptions (OBI) processing tasks demanding expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate cognition. OBI-Bench includes 5,523 meticulously collected diverse-sourced images, covering five key domain problems: recognition, rejoining, classification, retrieval, and deciphering. These images span centuries of archaeological findings and years of research by front-line scholars, comprising multi-stage font appearances from excavation to synthesis, such as original oracle bone, inked rubbings, oracle bone fragments, cropped single characters, and handprinted characters. Unlike existing benchmarks, OBI-Bench focuses on advanced visual perception and reasoning with OBI-specific knowledge, challenging LMMs to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. The evaluation of 6 proprietary LMMs as well as 17 open-source LMMs highlights the substantial challenges and demands posed by OBI-Bench. Even the latest versions of GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Qwen-VL-Max are still far from public-level humans in some fine-grained perception tasks. However, they perform at a level comparable to untrained humans in deciphering tasks, indicating remarkable capabilities in offering new interpretative perspectives and generating creative guesses. We hope OBI-Bench can facilitate the community to develop domain-specific multi-modal foundation models towards ancient language research and delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blaine Hoak, Ryan Sheatsley, Patrick McDaniel</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias significantly undermines both the accuracy and trustworthiness of machine learning models. To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image classification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture information rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for measuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how textures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies how strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying objects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are heavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the existence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples contain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true label, resulting in confident mispredictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Cao, Tongya Zheng, Qinghong Guo, Yu Wang, Junshu Dai, Shunyu Liu, Jie Yang, Jie Song, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maomao Li, Yu Li, Yunfei Liu, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Editability and fidelity are two essential demands for text-driven image editing, which expects that the editing area should align with the target prompt and the rest remain unchanged separately. The current cutting-edge editing methods usually obey an "inversion-then-editing" pipeline, where the input image is inverted to an approximate Gaussian noise ${z}_T$, based on which a sampling process is conducted using the target prompt. Nevertheless, we argue that it is not a good choice to use a near-Gaussian noise as a pivot for further editing since it would bring plentiful fidelity errors. We verify this by a pilot analysis, discovering that intermediate-inverted latents can achieve a better trade-off between editability and fidelity than the fully-inverted ${z}_T$. Based on this, we propose a novel zero-shot editing paradigm dubbed ZZEdit, which first locates a qualified intermediate-inverted latent marked as ${z}_p$ as a better editing pivot, which is sufficient-for-editing while structure-preserving. Then, a ZigZag process is designed to execute denoising and inversion alternately, which progressively inject target guidance to ${z}_p$ while preserving the structure information of $p$ step. Afterwards, to achieve the same step number of inversion and denoising, we execute a pure sampling process under the target prompt. Essentially, our ZZEdit performs iterative manifold constraint between the manifold of $M_{p}$ and $M_{p-1}$, leading to fewer fidelity errors. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ZZEdit in diverse image editing scenarios compared with the "inversion-then-editing" pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI algorithms have become valuable in aiding professionals in healthcare. The increasing confidence obtained by these models is helpful in critical decision demands. In clinical dermatology, classification models can detect malignant lesions on patients' skin using only RGB images as input. However, most learning-based methods employ data acquired from dermoscopic datasets on training, which are large and validated by a gold standard. Clinical models aim to deal with classification on users' smartphone cameras that do not contain the corresponding resolution provided by dermoscopy. Also, clinical applications bring new challenges. It can contain captures from uncontrolled environments, skin tone variations, viewpoint changes, noises in data and labels, and unbalanced classes. A possible alternative would be to use transfer learning to deal with the clinical images. However, as the number of samples is low, it can cause degradations on the model's performance; the source distribution used in training differs from the test set. This work aims to evaluate the gap between dermoscopic and clinical samples and understand how the dataset variations impact training. It assesses the main differences between distributions that disturb the model's prediction. Finally, from experiments on different architectures, we argue how to combine the data from divergent distributions, decreasing the impact on the model's final accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Chen, Qianyi Wu, Weiyao Lin, Mehrtash Harandi, Jianfei Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS. Our code is available at https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/HAC-plus.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advancing machine visual reasoning requires a deeper understanding of how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) process and interpret complex visual patterns. This work introduces a novel, cognitively-inspired evaluation framework to systematically analyze VLM reasoning on natural image-based Bongard Problems. We propose three structured paradigms -- Direct Visual Rule Learning, Deductive Rule Learning, and Componential Analysis -- designed to progressively enforce step-wise reasoning and disentangle the interplay between perception and reasoning. Our evaluation shows that advanced, closed-source VLMs (GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0) achieve near-superhuman performance, particularly when provided with high-quality image descriptions, while open-source models exhibit a significant performance bottleneck due to deficiencies in perception. An ablation study further confirms that perception, rather than reasoning, is the primary limiting factor, as open-source models apply extracted rules effectively when given accurate descriptions. These findings underscore the critical role of robust multimodal perception in enhancing generalizable visual reasoning and highlight the importance of structured, step-wise reasoning paradigms for advancing machine intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huazhong Zhao, Lei Qi, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: The Visual Language Model, known for its robust cross-modal capabilities, has been extensively applied in various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore the use of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs to align visual and textual features, for acquiring fine-grained and domain-invariant representations in generalizable person re-identification. The adaptation of CLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained features to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant features to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the first challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a three-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions. Initially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person re-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the image encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for each image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to guide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method is introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically, domain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive (pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative (pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to train the image encoder. Collectively, these strategies contribute to the development of an innovative CLIP-based framework for learning fine-grained generalized features in person re-identification.</p>

Our research proposed "Beyond-Labels," a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a handful of image segmentation data to fuse frozen image representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to successfully actualize enormous knowledge from pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining, making the model data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we efficiently captured positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, thus improving the generalization across various image sizes, addressing one of the key limitations of previous methods. Extensive ablation tests were performed to investigate the important components of our proposed method; when tested against the common benchmark PASCAL-5i, it demonstrated superior performance despite being trained on frozen image and language characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlong Wan, Xiaoyan Jiang, Guangsheng Luo, Ferdous Sohel, Jenqneng Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic crack segmentation is a cornerstone technology for intelligent visual perception modules in road safety maintenance and structural integrity systems. Existing deep learning models and ``pre-training + fine-tuning'' paradigms often face challenges of limited adaptability in resource-constrained environments and inadequate scalability across diverse data domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiCrackNet, a novel pipeline that seamlessly integrates traditional deep learning paradigms with the strengths of large-scale pre-trained models. At its core, FlexiCrackNet employs an encoder-decoder architecture to extract task-specific features. The lightweight EdgeSAM's CNN-based encoder is exclusively used as a generic feature extractor, decoupled from the fixed input size requirements of EdgeSAM. To harmonize general and domain-specific features, we introduce the information-Interaction gated attention mechanism (IGAM), which adaptively fuses multi-level features to enhance segmentation performance while mitigating irrelevant noise. This design enables the efficient transfer of general knowledge to crack segmentation tasks while ensuring adaptability to diverse input resolutions and resource-constrained environments. Experiments show that FlexiCrackNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, excels in zero-shot generalization, computational efficiency, and segmentation robustness under challenging scenarios such as blurry inputs, complex backgrounds, and visually ambiguous artifacts. These advancements underscore the potential of FlexiCrackNet for real-world applications in automated crack detection and comprehensive structural health monitoring systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongkun Liu, Bing Li, Xiao Jin, Yupeng Shi, Qiuying Li, Xiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial defect segmentation is critical for manufacturing quality control. Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode.

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinda Lu, Junkang Wu, Jinghan Li, Xiaojun Jia, Shuo Wang, YiFan Zhang, Junfeng Fang, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown effectiveness in aligning multi-modal large language models (MLLM) with human preferences. However, existing methods exhibit an imbalanced responsiveness to the data of varying hardness, tending to overfit on the easy-to-distinguish data while underfitting on the hard-to-distinguish data. In this paper, we propose Data- and Model-aware DPO (DAMA) to dynamically adjust the optimization process from two key aspects: (1) a data-aware strategy that incorporates data hardness, and (2) a model-aware strategy that integrates real-time model responses. By combining the two strategies, DAMA enables the model to effectively adapt to data with varying levels of hardness. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that DAMA not only significantly enhances the trustworthiness, but also improves the effectiveness over general tasks. For instance, on the Object-HalBench, our DAMA-7B reduces response-level and mentioned-level hallucination by 90.0% and 95.3%, respectively, surpassing the performance of GPT-4V.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Kumar, Aman Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the challenges of integrating human visual cue-based dehazing into object detection, given the selective nature of human perception. While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feifei Li, Qi Song, Chi Zhang, Hui Shuai, Rui Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of estimating camera poses can be enhanced through novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to increase the diversity and extension of training data. However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengjian Kang, Ye Zhang, Xiaoyu Deng, Xintao Li, Yongzhe Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents LP-DETR (Layer-wise Progressive DETR), a novel approach that enhances DETR-based object detection through multi-scale relation modeling. Our method introduces learnable spatial relationships between object queries through a relation-aware self-attention mechanism, which adaptively learns to balance different scales of relations (local, medium and global) across decoder layers. This progressive design enables the model to effectively capture evolving spatial dependencies throughout the detection pipeline. Extensive experiments on COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our method improves both convergence speed and detection accuracy compared to standard self-attention module. The proposed method achieves competitive results, reaching 52.3\% AP with 12 epochs and 52.5\% AP with 24 epochs using ResNet-50 backbone, and further improving to 58.0\% AP with Swin-L backbone. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an interesting pattern: the model naturally learns to prioritize local spatial relations in early decoder layers while gradually shifting attention to broader contexts in deeper layers, providing valuable insights for future research in object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhen Zhu, Mokai Pan, Yuexin Ma, Yanwei Fu, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Liu, Ailing Zeng, Wei Xue, Harry Yang, Wenhan Luo, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Crafting magic and illusions is one of the most thrilling aspects of filmmaking, with visual effects (VFX) serving as the powerhouse behind unforgettable cinematic experiences. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Mule, Matteo Pannacci, Ali Ghasemi Goudarzi, Francesco Pro, Lorenzo Papa, Luca Maiano, Irene Amerini</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8\% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aobotao Dai, Xinyu Ma, Lei Chen, Songze Li, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained considerable prominence in recent years due to their remarkable capability to effectively integrate and process both textual and visual information. This integration has significantly enhanced performance across a diverse spectrum of applications, such as scene perception and robotics. However, the deployment of VLMs has also given rise to critical safety and security concerns, necessitating extensive research to assess the potential vulnerabilities these VLM systems may harbor. In this work, we present an in-depth survey of the attack strategies tailored for VLMs. We categorize these attacks based on their underlying objectives - namely jailbreak, camouflage, and exploitation - while also detailing the various methodologies employed for data manipulation of VLMs. Meanwhile, we outline corresponding defense mechanisms that have been proposed to mitigate these vulnerabilities. By discerning key connections and distinctions among the diverse types of attacks, we propose a compelling taxonomy for VLM attacks. Moreover, we summarize the evaluation metrics that comprehensively describe the characteristics and impact of different attacks on VLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of promising future research directions that could further enhance the robustness and safety of VLMs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing exploration in this critical area of study.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Hu, Zixu Cheng, Chenyang Si, Wei Li, Shaogang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Li, Xiaojin Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Zeraatkar, Salah Faroughi, Jelena Te\v{s}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Earth system models (ESMs) integrate the interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, and biosphere to estimate the state of regional and global climate under a wide variety of conditions. The ESMs are highly complex, and thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data. In this paper, we propose the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the single image SR (SR) reconstruction task for the ESM data.
  Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks.
  Results: The ViSIR outperforms ViT by 4.1 dB, SIREN by 7.5 dB, and SR-Generative Adversarial (SR-GANs) by 7.1dB PSNR on average for three different measurements.
  Conclusion: The proposed ViSIR is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm is outperforming other methods in terms of Mean Square Error(MSE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyanil Banerjee, Nicholas Summerfield, Ming Dong, Carri Glide-Hurst</p>
<p>Abstract: U-shaped networks and its variants have demonstrated exceptional results for medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel dual self-distillation (DSD) framework in U-shaped networks for volumetric medical image segmentation. DSD distills knowledge from the ground-truth segmentation labels to the decoder layers. Additionally, DSD also distills knowledge from the deepest decoder and encoder layer to the shallower decoder and encoder layers respectively of a single U-shaped network. DSD is a generalized training strategy that could be attached to the backbone architecture of any U-shaped network to further improve its segmentation performance. We attached DSD on several state-of-the-art U-shaped backbones, and extensive experiments on various public 3D medical image segmentation datasets (cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus) demonstrated significant improvement over the same backbones without DSD. On average, after attaching DSD to the U-shaped backbones, we observed an increase of 2.82\%, 4.53\% and 1.3\% in Dice similarity score, a decrease of 7.15 mm, 6.48 mm and 0.76 mm in the Hausdorff distance, for cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus segmentation, respectively. These improvements were achieved with negligible increase in the number of trainable parameters and training time. Our proposed DSD framework also led to significant qualitative improvements for cardiac substructure, brain tumor and Hippocampus segmentation over the U-shaped backbones.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models for Text-to-Image (T2I) conditional generation have recently achieved tremendous success. Yet, aligning these models with user's intentions still involves a laborious trial-and-error process, and this challenging alignment problem has attracted considerable attention from the research community. In this work, instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models, we use Mutual Information (MI) to guide model alignment. In brief, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on a point-wise (MI) estimation between prompts and images to create a synthetic fine-tuning set for improving model alignment. Our analysis indicates that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art, yet it only requires the pre-trained denoising network of the T2I model itself to estimate MI, and a simple fine-tuning strategy that improves alignment while maintaining image quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunbei Zhang, Akshay Mehra, Shuaicheng Niu, Jihun Hamm</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to adapt source pre-trained models to continually changing, unseen target domains. While existing CTTA methods assume structured domain changes with uniform durations, real-world environments often exhibit dynamic patterns where domains recur with varying frequencies and durations. Current approaches, which adapt the same parameters across different domains, struggle in such dynamic conditions-they face convergence issues with brief domain exposures, risk forgetting previously learned knowledge, or misapplying it to irrelevant domains. To remedy this, we propose DPCore, a method designed for robust performance across diverse domain change patterns while ensuring computational efficiency. DPCore integrates three key components: Visual Prompt Adaptation for efficient domain alignment, a Prompt Coreset for knowledge preservation, and a Dynamic Update mechanism that intelligently adjusts existing prompts for similar domains while creating new ones for substantially different domains. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DPCore consistently outperforms various CTTA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both structured and dynamic settings while reducing trainable parameters by 99% and computation time by 64% compared to previous approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyi Wang, Haizhou Shi, Shiwei Tan, Weiyi Qin, Wenyuan Wang, Tunyu Zhang, Akshay Nambi, Tanuja Ganu, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant promise in various applications, leading to broad interest from researchers and practitioners alike. However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyuan Qiao, Wenqi Lyu, Hui Wang, Zixu Wang, Zerui Li, Yuan Zhang, Mingkui Tan, Qi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks require an agent to follow textual instructions to navigate through 3D environments. Traditional approaches use supervised learning methods, relying heavily on domain-specific datasets to train VLN models. Recent methods try to utilize closed-source large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to solve VLN tasks in zero-shot manners, but face challenges related to expensive token costs and potential data breaches in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Open-Nav, a novel study that explores open-source LLMs for zero-shot VLN in the continuous environment. Open-Nav employs a spatial-temporal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning approach to break down tasks into instruction comprehension, progress estimation, and decision-making. It enhances scene perceptions with fine-grained object and spatial knowledge to improve LLM's reasoning in navigation. Our extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that Open-Nav achieves competitive performance compared to using closed-source LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changdae Oh, Yixuan Li, Kyungwoo Song, Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting a pre-trained foundation model on downstream tasks should ensure robustness against distribution shifts without the need to retrain the whole model. Although existing weight interpolation methods are simple yet effective, we argue their static nature limits downstream performance while achieving efficiency. In this work, we propose DaWin, a training-free dynamic weight interpolation method that leverages the entropy of individual models over each unlabeled test sample to assess model expertise, and compute per-sample interpolation coefficients dynamically. Unlike previous works that typically rely on additional training to learn such coefficients, our approach requires no training. Then, we propose a mixture modeling approach that greatly reduces inference overhead raised by dynamic interpolation. We validate DaWin on the large-scale visual recognition benchmarks, spanning 14 tasks across robust fine-tuning -- ImageNet and derived five distribution shift benchmarks -- and multi-task learning with eight classification tasks. Results demonstrate that DaWin achieves significant performance gain in considered settings, with minimal computational overhead. We further discuss DaWin's analytic behavior to explain its empirical success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching Lam Choi, Alexandre Duplessis, Serge Belongie</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient-based interpretations often require an anchor point of comparison to avoid saturation in computing feature importance. We show that current baselines defined using static functions--constant mapping, averaging or blurring--inject harmful colour, texture or frequency assumptions that deviate from model behaviour. This leads to accumulation of irregular gradients, resulting in attribution maps that are biased, fragile and manipulable. Departing from the static approach, we propose UNI to compute an (un)learnable, debiased and adaptive baseline by perturbing the input towards an unlearning direction of steepest ascent. Our method discovers reliable baselines and succeeds in erasing salient features, which in turn locally smooths the high-curvature decision boundaries. Our analyses point to unlearning as a promising avenue for generating faithful, efficient and robust interpretations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinith M. Suriyakumar, Rohan Alur, Ayush Sekhari, Manish Raghavan, Ashia C. Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on massive, web-scale datasets. Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "concept unlearning" with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4 and Stable Diffusion v2.1. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Huu Cap</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSI) glomerulus segmentation is essential for accurately diagnosing kidney diseases. In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/huuquan1994/wsi_glomerulus_seg.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17438">Object-centric proto-symbolic behavioural reasoning from pixels</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruben van Bergen, Justus H\"ubotter, Pablo Lanillos</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous intelligent agents must bridge computational challenges at disparate levels of abstraction, from the low-level spaces of sensory input and motor commands to the high-level domain of abstract reasoning and planning. A key question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the representational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally without requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These objectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of objects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel, brain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to interpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric representations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic environments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and (low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent conditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \to B) \land (\neg A \to C)$, as well as logical composition $(A \to B) \land (A \to C) \vdash A \to (B \land C)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy objectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to unexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its world model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the present results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions of dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed architecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key inductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07041">Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengying Lei, Lijun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Completing multidimensional tensor-structured data with missing entries is a fundamental task for many real-world applications involving incomplete or corrupted datasets. For data with spatial or temporal side information, low-rank factorization models with smoothness constraints have demonstrated strong performance. Although effective at capturing global and long-range correlations, these models often struggle to capture short-scale, high-frequency variations in the data. To address this limitation, we propose the Generalized Least Squares Kernelized Tensor Factorization (GLSKF) framework for tensor completion. GLSKF integrates smoothness-constrained low-rank factorization with a locally correlated residual process; the resulting additive structure enables effective characterization of both global dependencies and local variations. Specifically, we define the covariance norm to enforce the smoothness of factor matrices in the global low-rank factorization, and use structured covariance/kernel functions to model the local processes. For model estimation, we develop an alternating least squares (ALS) procedure with closed-form solutions for each subproblem. GLSKF utilizes zero-padding and slicing operations based on projection matrices which preserve the Kronecker structure of covariances, facilitating efficient computations through the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The proposed framework is evaluated on four real-world datasets across diverse tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that GLSKF achieves superior performance and scalability, establishing it as a novel solution for multidimensional tensor completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Nasr-Esfahani, Mehdi Bekrani, Roozbeh Rajabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced speech recognition applications. However, many existing neural network-based methods struggle with noise, reducing accuracy in real-world environments. This study addresses isolated spoken Persian digit recognition (zero to nine) under noisy conditions, particularly for phonetically similar numbers. A hybrid model combining residual convolutional neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) is proposed, utilizing word units instead of phoneme units for speaker-independent recognition. The FARSDIGIT1 dataset, augmented with various approaches, is processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving 98.53%, 96.10%, and 95.92% accuracy on training, validation, and test sets, respectively. In noisy conditions, the proposed approach improves recognition by 26.88% over phoneme unit-based LSTM models and surpasses the Mel-scale Two Dimension Root Cepstrum Coefficients (MTDRCC) feature extraction technique along with MLP model (MTDRCC+MLP) by 7.61%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Donhauser, Kristina Ulicna, Gemma Elyse Moran, Aditya Ravuri, Kian Kenyon-Dean, Cian Eastwood, Jason Hartford</p>
<p>Abstract: Dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful interpretability tool for large language models. By extracting known concepts (e.g., Golden-Gate Bridge) from human-interpretable data (e.g., text), sparse DL can elucidate a model's inner workings. In this work, we ask if DL can also be used to discover unknown concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data (e.g., cell images), ultimately enabling modern approaches to scientific discovery. As a first step, we use DL algorithms to study microscopy foundation models trained on multi-cell image data, where little prior knowledge exists regarding which high-level concepts should arise. We show that sparse dictionaries indeed extract biologically-meaningful concepts such as cell type and genetic perturbation type. We also propose Iterative Codebook Feature Learning~(ICFL) and combine it with a pre-processing step which uses PCA whitening from a control dataset. In our experiments, we demonstrate that both ICFL and PCA improve the selectivity of extracted features compared to TopK sparse autoencoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Rouditchenko, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines lip-based video with audio and can improve performance in noise, but most methods are trained only on English data. One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Yuquan Deng, Jesse Zhang, Joel Jang, Marius Memme, Raymond Yu, Caelan Reed Garrett, Fabio Ramos, Dieter Fox, Anqi Li, Abhishek Gupta, Ankit Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06314">From Pixels to Components: Eigenvector Masking for Visual Representation Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alice Bizeul, Thomas Sutter, Alain Ryser, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Julius von K\"ugelgen, Julia E. Vogt</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting masked from visible parts of an image is a powerful self-supervised approach for visual representation learning. However, the common practice of masking random patches of pixels exhibits certain failure modes, which can prevent learning meaningful high-level features, as required for downstream tasks. We propose an alternative masking strategy that operates on a suitable transformation of the data rather than on the raw pixels. Specifically, we perform principal component analysis and then randomly mask a subset of components, which accounts for a fixed ratio of the data variance. The learning task then amounts to reconstructing the masked components from the visible ones. Compared to local patches of pixels, the principal components of images carry more global information. We thus posit that predicting masked from visible components involves more high-level features, allowing our masking strategy to extract more useful representations. This is corroborated by our empirical findings which demonstrate improved image classification performance for component over pixel masking. Our method thus constitutes a simple and robust data-driven alternative to traditional masked image modeling approaches.</p>
