<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangzhou Lin, Songlin Hou, Haotian Liu, Shang Gao, Kazunori D Yamada, Haichong K. Zhang, Ziming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is widely used as a metric to quantify difference between two point clouds. In point cloud completion, Chamfer Distance (CD) is typically used as a loss function in deep learning frameworks. However, it is generally acknowledged within the field that Chamfer Distance (CD) is vulnerable to the presence of outliers, which can consequently lead to the convergence on suboptimal models. In divergence from the existing literature, which largely concentrates on resolving such concerns in the realm of Euclidean space, we put forth a notably uncomplicated yet potent metric specifically designed for point cloud completion tasks: {Hyperbolic Chamfer Distance (HyperCD)}. This metric conducts Chamfer Distance computations within the parameters of hyperbolic space. During the backpropagation process, HyperCD systematically allocates greater weight to matched point pairs exhibiting reduced Euclidean distances. This mechanism facilitates the preservation of accurate point pair matches while permitting the incremental adjustment of suboptimal matches, thereby contributing to enhanced point cloud completion outcomes. Moreover, measure the shape dissimilarity is not solely work for point cloud completion task, we further explore its applications in other generative related tasks, including single image reconstruction from point cloud, and upsampling. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the point cloud completion benchmark datasets, PCN, ShapeNet-55, and ShapeNet-34, and show from visualization that HyperCD can significantly improve the surface smoothness, we also provide the provide experimental results beyond completion task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Rasoulzadeh, M. Bank, M. Wimmer, I. Kovacic, K. Schinegger, S. Rutzinger</p>
<p>Abstract: $\textit{ArchComplete}$ is a two-stage dense voxel-based 3D generative pipeline developed to tackle the high complexity in architectural geometries and topologies, assisting with ideation and geometric detailisation in the early design process. In stage 1, a $\textit{3D Voxel VQGAN}$ model is devised, whose composition is then modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse models. Subsequently, in stage 2, $\textit{Hierarchical Voxel Upsampling Networks}$ consisting of a set of 3D conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models are defined to augment the coarse shapes with fine geometric details. The first stage is trained on a dataset of house models with fully modelled exteriors and interiors with a novel 2.5D perceptual loss to capture input complexities across multiple abstraction levels, while the second stage trains on randomly cropped local volumetric patches, requiring significantly less compute and memory. For inference, the pipeline first autoregressively generates house models at a resolution of $64^3$ and then progressively refines them to resolution of $256^3$ with voxel sizes as small as $18\text{cm}$. ArchComplete supports a range of interaction modes solving a variety of tasks, including interpolation, variation generation, unconditional synthesis, and two conditional synthesis tasks: shape completion and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation. The results demonstrate notable improvements against state-of-the-art on established metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Datta Rachuri, Duoduo Liao, Samhita Sarikonda, Datha Vaishnavi Kondur</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study introducing a multimodal fusion framework for the detection and analysis of bridge defects, integrating Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques with advanced image processing to enable precise structural assessment. By combining data from Impact Echo (IE) and Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW) methods, this preliminary investigation focuses on identifying defect-prone regions within concrete structures, emphasizing critical indicators such as delamination and debonding. Using geospatial analysis with alpha shapes, fusion of defect points, and unified lane boundaries, the proposed framework consolidates disparate data sources to enhance defect localization and facilitate the identification of overlapping defect regions. Cross-verification with adaptive image processing further validates detected defects by aligning their coordinates with visual data, utilizing advanced contour-based mapping and bounding box techniques for precise defect identification. The experimental results, with an F1 score of 0.83, demonstrate the potential efficacy of the approach in improving defect localization, reducing false positives, and enhancing detection accuracy, which provides a foundation for future research and larger-scale validation. This preliminary exploration establishes the framework as a promising tool for efficient bridge health assessment, with implications for proactive structural monitoring and maintenance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor J\'unio Alc\^antara Cardoso, Rodrigo Moreira, Jo\~ao Fernando Mari, Larissa Ferreira Rodrigues Moreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Sickle cell anemia, which is characterized by abnormal erythrocyte morphology, can be detected using microscopic images. Computational techniques in medicine enhance the diagnosis and treatment efficiency. However, many computational techniques, particularly those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), require high resources and time for training, highlighting the research opportunities in methods with low computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach combining conventional classifiers, segmented images, and CNNs for the automated classification of sickle cell disease. We evaluated the impact of segmented images on classification, providing insight into deep learning integration. Our results demonstrate that using segmented images and CNN features with an SVM achieves an accuracy of 96.80%. This finding is relevant for computationally efficient scenarios, paving the way for future research and advancements in medical-image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyu Chen, Shuwen Wei, Yihao Liu, Zhangxing Bian, Yufan He, Aaron Carass, Harrison Bai, Yong Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatially varying regularization accommodates the deformation variations that may be necessary for different anatomical regions during deformable image registration. Historically, optimization-based registration models have harnessed spatially varying regularization to address anatomical subtleties. However, most modern deep learning-based models tend to gravitate towards spatially invariant regularization, wherein a homogenous regularization strength is applied across the entire image, potentially disregarding localized variations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that integrates a prior distribution on the deformation regularization strength, enabling the end-to-end learning of a spatially varying deformation regularizer directly from the data. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and easily integrates with various registration network architectures. Additionally, automatic tuning of hyperparameters is achieved through Bayesian optimization, allowing efficient identification of optimal hyperparameters for any given registration task. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves registration performance and enhances the interpretability of deep learning-based registration, all while maintaining smooth deformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeny Hershkovitch Neiterman, Gil Ben-Artzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Training very deep convolutional networks is challenging, requiring significant computational resources and time. Existing acceleration methods often depend on specific architectures or require network modifications. We introduce LayerDropBack (LDB), a simple yet effective method to accelerate training across a wide range of deep networks. LDB introduces randomness only in the backward pass, maintaining the integrity of the forward pass, guaranteeing that the same network is used during both training and inference. LDB can be seamlessly integrated into the training process of any model without altering its architecture, making it suitable for various network topologies. Our extensive experiments across multiple architectures (ViT, Swin Transformer, EfficientNet, DLA) and datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet) show significant training time reductions of 16.93\% to 23.97\%, while preserving or even enhancing model accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirko Zaffaroni, Federico Signoretta, Marco Grangetto, Attilio Fiandrotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial in applications such as autonomous driving or service robotics, to name a few. Deep generative models achieve top performance in this task, assuming enough labelled trajectories are available for training. To this end, large amounts of synthetically generated, labelled trajectories exist (e.g., generated by video games). However, such trajectories are not meant to represent pedestrian motion realistically and are ineffective at training a predictive model. We propose a method and an architecture to augment synthetic trajectories at training time and with an adversarial approach. We show that trajectory augmentation at training time unleashes significant gains when a state-of-the-art generative model is evaluated over real-world trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Wen, Yilin Wang, Neil Birkbeck, Balu Adsumilli</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of short-form videos, characterized by diverse content, editing styles, and artifacts, poses substantial challenges for learning-based blind video quality assessment (BVQA) models. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), renowned for their superior generalization capabilities, present a promising solution. This paper focuses on effectively leveraging a pretrained MLLM for short-form video quality assessment, regarding the impacts of pre-processing and response variability, and insights on combining the MLLM with BVQA models. We first investigated how frame pre-processing and sampling techniques influence the MLLM's performance. Then, we introduced a lightweight learning-based ensemble method that adaptively integrates predictions from the MLLM and state-of-the-art BVQA models. Our results demonstrated superior generalization performance with the proposed ensemble approach. Furthermore, the analysis of content-aware ensemble weights highlighted that some video characteristics are not fully represented by existing BVQA models, revealing potential directions to improve BVQA models further.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18065">BIG-MoE: Bypass Isolated Gating MoE for Generalized Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingjie Ma, Zitong Yu, Xun Lin, Weicheng Xie, Linlin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of facial recognition security, multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential for countering presentation attacks. However, existing technologies encounter challenges due to modality biases and imbalances, as well as domain shifts. Our research introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to address these issues effectively. We identified three limitations in traditional MoE approaches to multimodal FAS: (1) Coarse-grained experts' inability to capture nuanced spoofing indicators; (2) Gated networks' susceptibility to input noise affecting decision-making; (3) MoE's sensitivity to prompt tokens leading to overfitting with conventional learning methods. To mitigate these, we propose the Bypass Isolated Gating MoE (BIG-MoE) framework, featuring: (1) Fine-grained experts for enhanced detection of subtle spoofing cues; (2) An isolation gating mechanism to counteract input noise; (3) A novel differential convolutional prompt bypass enriching the gating network with critical local features, thereby improving perceptual capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant generalization performance improvement in multimodal FAS task. The code is released at https://github.com/murInJ/BIG-MoE.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18072">MMFactory: A Universal Solution Search Engine for Vision-Language Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wan-Cyuan Fan, Tanzila Rahman, Leonid Sigal</p>
<p>Abstract: With advances in foundational and vision-language models, and effective fine-tuning techniques, a large number of both general and special-purpose models have been developed for a variety of visual tasks. Despite the flexibility and accessibility of these models, no single model is able to handle all tasks and/or applications that may be envisioned by potential users. Recent approaches, such as visual programming and multimodal LLMs with integrated tools aim to tackle complex visual tasks, by way of program synthesis. However, such approaches overlook user constraints (e.g., performance / computational needs), produce test-time sample-specific solutions that are difficult to deploy, and, sometimes, require low-level instructions that maybe beyond the abilities of a naive user. To address these limitations, we introduce MMFactory, a universal framework that includes model and metrics routing components, acting like a solution search engine across various available models. Based on a task description and few sample input-output pairs and (optionally) resource and/or performance constraints, MMFactory can suggest a diverse pool of programmatic solutions by instantiating and combining visio-lingual tools from its model repository. In addition to synthesizing these solutions, MMFactory also proposes metrics and benchmarks performance / resource characteristics, allowing users to pick a solution that meets their unique design constraints. From the technical perspective, we also introduced a committee-based solution proposer that leverages multi-agent LLM conversation to generate executable, diverse, universal, and robust solutions for the user. Experimental results show that MMFactory outperforms existing methods by delivering state-of-the-art solutions tailored to user problem specifications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Xin Ma, Xiaochen Yang, Yuxiang Zhang, Yanni Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-modal object detection tasks often experience performance degradation when encountering diverse scenarios. In contrast, multimodal object detection tasks can offer more comprehensive information about object features by integrating data from various modalities. Current multimodal object detection methods generally use various fusion techniques, including conventional neural networks and transformer-based models, to implement feature fusion strategies and achieve complementary information. However, since multimodal images are captured by different sensors, there are often misalignments between them, making direct matching challenging. This misalignment hinders the ability to establish strong correlations for the same object across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the CrOss-Mamba interaction and Offset-guided fusion (COMO) framework for multimodal object detection tasks. The COMO framework employs the cross-mamba technique to formulate feature interaction equations, enabling multimodal serialized state computation. This results in interactive fusion outputs while reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency. Additionally, COMO leverages high-level features, which are less affected by misalignment, to facilitate interaction and transfer complementary information between modalities, addressing the positional offset challenges caused by variations in camera angles and capture times. Furthermore, COMO incorporates a global and local scanning mechanism in the cross-mamba module to capture features with local correlation, particularly in remote sensing images. To preserve low-level features, the offset-guided fusion mechanism ensures effective multiscale feature utilization, allowing the construction of a multiscale fusion data cube that enhances detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijie Wei, Weihong Yu, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous research on retinal vessel segmentation is targeted at a specific image domain, mostly color fundus photography (CFP). In this paper we make a brave attempt to attack a more challenging task of broad-domain retinal vessel segmentation (BD-RVS), which is to develop a unified model applicable to varied domains including CFP, SLO, UWF, OCTA and FFA. To that end, we propose Dual Convoltuional Prompting (DCP) that learns to extract domain-specific features by localized prompting along both position and channel dimensions. DCP is designed as a plug-in module that can effectively turn a R2AU-Net based vessel segmentation network to a unified model, yet without the need of modifying its network structure. For evaluation we build a broad-domain set using five public domain-specific datasets including ROSSA, FIVES, IOSTAR, PRIME-FP20 and VAMPIRE. In order to benchmark BD-RVS on the broad-domain dataset, we re-purpose a number of existing methods originally developed in other contexts, producing eight baseline methods in total. Extensive experiments show the the proposed method compares favorably against the baselines for BD-RVS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small object detection aims to localize and classify small objects within images. With recent advances in large-scale vision-language pretraining, finetuning pretrained object detection models has emerged as a promising approach. However, finetuning large models is computationally and memory expensive. To address this issue, this paper introduces multi-point positional insertion (MPI) tuning, a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method for small object detection. Specifically, MPI incorporates multiple positional embeddings into a frozen pretrained model, enabling the efficient detection of small objects by providing precise positional information to latent features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method on the SODA-D dataset. MPI performed comparably to conventional PEFT methods, including CoOp and VPT, while significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be tuned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Fernando Alvarenga e Silva, Samuel Felipe dos Santos, Nicu Sebe, Jurandy Almeida</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn directly from raw data, resulting in exceptional performance across various research areas. However, factors present in non-controllable environments such as unlabeled datasets with varying levels of domain and category shift can reduce model accuracy. The Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) is a challenging problem that arises when both of these issues occur together. Existing OSDA approaches in literature only align known classes or use supervised training to learn unknown classes as a single new category. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve OSDA techniques by extracting a set of high-confidence unknown instances and using it as a hard constraint to tighten the classification boundaries. Specifically, we use a new loss constraint that is evaluated in three different ways: (1) using pristine negative instances directly; (2) using data augmentation techniques to create randomly transformed negatives; and (3) with generated synthetic negatives containing adversarial features. We analyze different strategies to improve the discriminator and the training of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used to generate synthetic negatives. We conducted extensive experiments and analysis on OVANet using three widely-used public benchmarks, the Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA datasets. We were able to achieve similar H-score to other state-of-the-art methods, while increasing the accuracy on unknown categories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual understanding. This impressive leap raises a compelling question: how can language models, initially trained solely on linguistic data, effectively interpret and process visual content? This paper aims to address this question with systematic investigation across 4 model families and 4 model scales, uncovering a unique class of attention heads that focus specifically on visual content. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the behavior of these attention heads, the distribution of attention weights, and their concentration on visual tokens within the input. These findings enhance our understanding of how LLMs adapt to multimodal tasks, demonstrating their potential to bridge the gap between textual and visual understanding. This work paves the way for the development of AI systems capable of engaging with diverse modalities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18112">Spectrum-oriented Point-supervised Saliency Detector for Hyperspectral Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peifu Liu, Tingfa Xu, Guokai Shi, Jingxuan Xu, Huan Chen, Jianan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral salient object detection (HSOD) aims to extract targets or regions with significantly different spectra from hyperspectral images. While existing deep learning-based methods can achieve good detection results, they generally necessitate pixel-level annotations, which are notably challenging to acquire for hyperspectral images. To address this issue, we introduce point supervision into HSOD, and incorporate Spectral Saliency, derived from conventional HSOD methods, as a pivotal spectral representation within the framework. This integration leads to the development of a novel Spectrum-oriented Point-supervised Saliency Detector (SPSD). Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline, specifically designed for HSIs, to generate pseudo-labels, effectively mitigating the performance decline associated with point supervision strategy. Additionally, Spectral Saliency is employed to counteract information loss during model supervision and saliency refinement, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and edge accuracy of the detected objects. Furthermore, we introduce a Spectrum-transformed Spatial Gate to focus more precisely on salient regions while reducing feature redundancy. We have carried out comprehensive experiments on both HSOD-BIT and HS-SOD datasets to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, using mean absolute error (MAE), E-measure, F-measure, Area Under Curve, and Cross Correlation as evaluation metrics. For instance, on the HSOD-BIT dataset, our SPSD achieves a MAE of 0.031 and an F-measure of 0.878. Thorough ablation studies have substantiated the effectiveness of each individual module and provided insights into the model's working mechanism. Further evaluations on RGB-thermal salient object detection datasets highlight the versatility of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohui Jin, Yi Shuai, Yongcheng Li, Lingcong Cai, Yun Li, Huifen Liu, Xiaomao Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: The early detection of glottic carcinoma is critical for improving patient outcomes, as it enables timely intervention, preserves vocal function, and significantly reduces the risk of tumor progression and metastasis. However, the similarity in morphology between glottic carcinoma and vocal cord dysplasia results in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a vision large language model-based (VisionLLM-based) multimodal fusion network for glottic carcinoma detection, known as MMGC-Net. By integrating image and text modalities, multimodal models can capture complementary information, leading to more accurate and robust predictions. In this paper, we collect a private real glottic carcinoma dataset named SYSU1H from the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, with 5,799 image-text pairs. We leverage an image encoder and additional Q-Former to extract vision embeddings and the Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama3) to obtain text embeddings. These modalities are then integrated through a laryngeal feature fusion block, enabling a comprehensive integration of image and text features, thereby improving the glottic carcinoma identification performance. Extensive experiments on the SYSU1H dataset demonstrate that MMGC-Net can achieve state-of-the-art performance, which is superior to previous multimodal models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuru Wang, Songtao Wang, Zehan Zhang, Xinyan Lu, Changwei Cai, Hao Li, Fu Liu, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present UniPLV, a powerful framework that unifies point clouds, images and text in a single learning paradigm for open-world 3D scene understanding. UniPLV employs the image modal as a bridge to co-embed 3D points with pre-aligned images and text in a shared feature space without requiring carefully crafted point cloud text pairs. To accomplish multi-modal alignment, we propose two key strategies:(i) logit and feature distillation modules between images and point clouds, and (ii) a vison-point matching module is given to explicitly correct the misalignment caused by points to pixels projection. To further improve the performance of our unified framework, we adopt four task-specific losses and a two-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15.6% and 14.8% for semantic segmentation over Base-Annotated and Annotation-Free tasks, respectively. The code will be released later.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-disaster assessments of buildings and infrastructure are crucial for both immediate recovery efforts and long-term resilience planning. This research introduces an innovative approach to automating post-disaster assessments through advanced deep learning models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Guo, Manh Tran, Jiaxin Cheng, Xiaoming Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The text-to-image (T2I) personalization diffusion model can generate images of the novel concept based on the user input text caption. However, existing T2I personalized methods either require test-time fine-tuning or fail to generate images that align well with the given text caption. In this work, we propose a new T2I personalization diffusion model, Dense-Face, which can generate face images with a consistent identity as the given reference subject and align well with the text caption. Specifically, we introduce a pose-controllable adapter for the high-fidelity image generation while maintaining the text-based editing ability of the pre-trained stable diffusion (SD). Additionally, we use internal features of the SD UNet to predict dense face annotations, enabling the proposed method to gain domain knowledge in face generation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive generation performance in image-text alignment, identity preservation, and pose control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Han, Haotian Fan, Jiachen Fu, Liang Li, Tao Li, Junhui Cui, Yunqiu Wang, Yang Tai, Jingwei Sun, Chunle Guo, Chongyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have achieved significant advancements. Correspondingly, many automated metrics have emerged to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of generative models. However, the performance comparison among these automated metrics is limited by existing small datasets. Additionally, these datasets lack the capacity to assess the performance of automated metrics at a fine-grained level. In this study, we contribute an EvalMuse-40K benchmark, gathering 40K image-text pairs with fine-grained human annotations for image-text alignment-related tasks. In the construction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt sampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our benchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of image-text alignment metrics for T2I models. Meanwhile, we introduce two new methods to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of T2I models: FGA-BLIP2 which involves end-to-end fine-tuning of a vision-language model to produce fine-grained image-text alignment scores and PN-VQA which adopts a novel positive-negative VQA manner in VQA models for zero-shot fine-grained evaluation. Both methods achieve impressive performance in image-text alignment evaluations. We also use our methods to rank current AIGC models, in which the results can serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of T2I generation. The data and code will be made publicly available.</p>

This work bridges this gap with DepthLab, a foundation depth inpainting model powered by image diffusion priors. Our model features two notable strengths: (1) it demonstrates resilience to depth-deficient regions, providing reliable completion for both continuous areas and isolated points, and (2) it faithfully preserves scale consistency with the conditioned known depth when filling in missing values. Drawing on these advantages, our approach proves its worth in various downstream tasks, including 3D scene inpainting, text-to-3D scene generation, sparse-view reconstruction with DUST3R, and LiDAR depth completion, exceeding current solutions in both numerical performance and visual quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Liu, Yuntao Wei, Junyan Lin, Shengyang Zhao, Heming Sun, Zhibo Chen, Wenjun Zeng, Xin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: While learned image compression methods have achieved impressive results in either human visual perception or machine vision tasks, they are often specialized only for one domain. This drawback limits their versatility and generalizability across scenarios and also requires retraining to adapt to new applications-a process that adds significant complexity and cost in real-world scenarios. In this study, we introduce an innovative semantics DISentanglement and COmposition VERsatile codec (DISCOVER) to simultaneously enhance human-eye perception and machine vision tasks. The approach derives a set of labels per task through multimodal large models, which grounding models are then applied for precise localization, enabling a comprehensive understanding and disentanglement of image components at the encoder side. At the decoding stage, a comprehensive reconstruction of the image is achieved by leveraging these encoded components alongside priors from generative models, thereby optimizing performance for both human visual perception and machine-based analytical tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations substantiate the robustness and effectiveness of DISCOVER, demonstrating superior performance in fulfilling the dual objectives of human and machine vision requirements.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18165">Parallel Neural Computing for Scene Understanding from LiDAR Perception in Autonomous Racing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Suwesh Prasad Sah</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving in high-speed racing, as opposed to urban environments, presents significant challenges in scene understanding due to rapid changes in the track environment. Traditional sequential network approaches may struggle to meet the real-time knowledge and decision-making demands of an autonomous agent covering large displacements in a short time. This paper proposes a novel baseline architecture for developing sophisticated models capable of true hardware-enabled parallelism, achieving neural processing speeds that mirror the agent's high velocity. The proposed model (Parallel Perception Network (PPN)) consists of two independent neural networks, segmentation and reconstruction networks, running parallelly on separate accelerated hardware. The model takes raw 3D point cloud data from the LiDAR sensor as input and converts it into a 2D Bird's Eye View Map on both devices. Each network independently extracts its input features along space and time dimensions and produces outputs parallelly. The proposed method's model is trained on a system with two NVIDIA T4 GPUs, using a combination of loss functions, including edge preservation, and demonstrates a 2x speedup in model inference time compared to a sequential configuration. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/suwesh/Parallel-Perception-Network.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Yin, Kaixuan Yin, Weixing Chen, Enbo Huang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) are two dominant models for image analysis. While CNNs excel at extracting multi-scale features and ViTs effectively capture global dependencies, both suffer from high computational costs, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have attracted attention due to their efficiency. However, their performance in image classification tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, this paper introduces VisionGRU, a novel RNN-based architecture designed for efficient image classification. VisionGRU leverages a simplified Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) to process large-scale image features with linear complexity. It divides images into smaller patches and progressively reduces the sequence length while increasing the channel depth, thus facilitating multi-scale feature extraction. A hierarchical 2DGRU module with bidirectional scanning captures both local and global contexts, improving long-range dependency modeling, particularly for tasks like semantic segmentation. Experimental results on the ImageNet and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that VisionGRU outperforms ViTs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs, especially for high-resolution images. These findings underscore the potential of RNN-based approaches for developing efficient and scalable computer vision solutions.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models.

<p>Abstract: Extracting medication names from handwritten doctor prescriptions is challenging due to the wide variability in handwriting styles and prescription formats. This paper presents a robust method for extracting medicine names using a combination of Mask R-CNN and Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (TrOCR) with Multi-Head Attention and Positional Embeddings. A novel dataset, featuring diverse handwritten prescriptions from various regions of Pakistan, was utilized to fine-tune the model on different handwriting styles. The Mask R-CNN model segments the prescription images to focus on the medicinal sections, while the TrOCR model, enhanced by Multi-Head Attention and Positional Embeddings, transcribes the isolated text. The transcribed text is then matched against a pre-existing database for accurate identification. The proposed approach achieved a character error rate (CER) of 1.4% on standard benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a reliable and efficient tool for automating medicine name extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: In competitive combat sports like boxing, analyzing a boxers's performance statics is crucial for evaluating the quantity and variety of punches delivered during bouts. These statistics provide valuable data and feedback, which are routinely used for coaching and performance enhancement. We introduce BoxMAC, a real-world boxing dataset featuring 15 professional boxers and encompassing 13 distinct action labels. Comprising over 60,000 frames, our dataset has been meticulously annotated for multiple actions per frame with inputs from a boxing coach. Since two boxers can execute different punches within a single timestamp, this problem falls under the domain of multi-label action classification. We propose a novel architecture for jointly recognizing multiple actions in both individual images and videos. We investigate baselines using deep neural network architectures to address both tasks. We believe that BoxMAC will enable researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more efficient models for performance analysis. With its realistic and diverse nature, BoxMAC can serve as a valuable resource for the advancement of boxing as a sport</p>

<p>Abstract: Vehicle detection and tracking in satellite video is essential in remote sensing (RS) applications. However, upon the statistical analysis of existing datasets, we find that the dim vehicles with low radiation intensity and limited contrast against the background are rarely annotated, which leads to the poor effect of existing approaches in detecting moving vehicles under low radiation conditions.

<p>Abstract: Controversial contents largely inundate the Internet, infringing various cultural norms and child protection standards. Traditional Image Content Moderation (ICM) models fall short in producing precise moderation decisions for diverse standards, while recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), when adopted to general rule-based ICM, often produce classification and explanation results that are inconsistent with human moderators. Aiming at flexible, explainable, and accurate ICM, we design a novel rule-based dataset generation pipeline, decomposing concise human-defined rules and leveraging well-designed multi-stage prompts to enrich short explicit image annotations. Our ICM-Instruct dataset includes detailed moderation explanation and moderation Q-A pairs. Built upon it, we create our ICM-Assistant model in the framework of rule-based ICM, making it readily applicable in real practice. Our ICM-Assistant model demonstrates exceptional performance and flexibility. Specifically, it significantly outperforms existing approaches on various sources, improving both the moderation classification (36.8\% on average) and moderation explanation quality (26.6\% on average) consistently over existing MLLMs. Code/Data is available at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/ICM-Assistant.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Adapter Merging with Centroid Prototype Mapping (ACMap), an exemplar-free framework for class-incremental learning (CIL) that addresses both catastrophic forgetting and scalability. While existing methods trade-off between inference time and accuracy, ACMap consolidates task-specific adapters into a single adapter, ensuring constant inference time across tasks without compromising accuracy. The framework employs adapter merging to build a shared subspace that aligns task representations and mitigates forgetting, while centroid prototype mapping maintains high accuracy through consistent adaptation in the shared subspace. To further improve scalability, an early stopping strategy limits adapter merging as tasks increase. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACMap matches state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining inference time comparable to the fastest existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianfeng Song, Yi Zou, Zheng Shi, Zheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijin Xie, Lin Sun, Bingquan Liu, Dexin Wang, Xiangzheng Zhang, Chengjie Sun, Jiajia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Distinguishing spatial relations is a basic part of human cognition which requires fine-grained perception on cross-instance. Although benchmarks like MME, MMBench and SEED comprehensively have evaluated various capabilities which already include visual spatial reasoning(VSR). There is still a lack of sufficient quantity and quality evaluation and optimization datasets for Vision Large Language Models(VLLMs) specifically targeting visual positional reasoning. To handle this, we first diagnosed current VLLMs with the VSR dataset and proposed a unified test set. We found current VLLMs to exhibit a contradiction of over-sensitivity to language instructions and under-sensitivity to visual positional information. By expanding the original benchmark from two aspects of tunning data and model structure, we mitigated this phenomenon. To our knowledge, we expanded spatially positioned image data controllably using diffusion models for the first time and integrated original visual encoding(CLIP) with other 3 powerful visual encoders(SigLIP, SAM and DINO). After conducting combination experiments on scaling data and models, we obtained a VLLM VSR Expert(VSRE) that not only generalizes better to different instructions but also accurately distinguishes differences in visual positional information. VSRE achieved over a 27\% increase in accuracy on the VSR test set. It becomes a performant VLLM on the position reasoning of both the VSR dataset and relevant subsets of other evaluation benchmarks. We open-sourced the expanded model with data and Appendix at \url{https://github.com/peijin360/vsre} and hope it will accelerate advancements in VLLM on VSR learning.</p>

To address these issues, we propose the Edge Detection Toolbox (ED-TOOLBOX), which utilizes generalizable plug-and-play components to adapt object detection models for edge environments. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Reparameterized Dynamic Convolutional Network (Rep-DConvNet) featuring weighted multi-shape convolutional branches to enhance detection performance. Additionally, we design a Sparse Cross-Attention (SC-A) network with a localized-mapping-assisted self-attention mechanism, enabling a well-crafted joint module for adaptive feature transfer. For real-world applications, we incorporate an Efficient Head into the YOLO framework to accelerate edge model optimization. To demonstrate practical impact, we identify a gap in helmet detection -- overlooking band fastening, a critical safety factor -- and create the Helmet Band Detection Dataset (HBDD). Using ED-TOOLBOX-optimized models, we address this real-world task. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ED-TOOLBOX, with edge detection models outperforming six state-of-the-art methods in visual surveillance simulations, achieving real-time and accurate performance. These results highlight ED-TOOLBOX as a superior solution for edge object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyan Lan, Shujun Li, Mingjie Xie, Xuanjia Zhao, Hongning Liu, Pengming Feng, Dongli Xu, Guangjun He, Jian Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Local climate zone (LCZ) classification is of great value for understanding the complex interactions between urban development and local climate. Recent studies have increasingly focused on the fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral data to improve LCZ classification performance. However, it remains challenging due to the distinct physical properties of these two types of data and the absence of effective fusion guidance. In this paper, a novel band prompting aided data fusion framework is proposed for LCZ classification, namely BP-LCZ, which utilizes textual prompts associated with band groups to guide the model in learning the physical attributes of different bands and semantics of various categories inherent in SAR and multi-spectral data to augment the fused feature, thus enhancing LCZ classification performance. Specifically, a band group prompting (BGP) strategy is introduced to align the visual representation effectively at the level of band groups, which also facilitates a more adequate extraction of semantic information of different bands with textual information. In addition, a multivariate supervised matrix (MSM) based training strategy is proposed to alleviate the problem of positive and negative sample confusion by completing the supervised information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed data fusion framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinquan Yu, Ziqi Sheng, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Jiantao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection aims to automatically identify real or fake news, thereby mitigating the adverse effects caused by such misinformation. Although prevailing approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness, challenges persist in cross-modal feature fusion and refinement for classification. To address this, we present a residual-aware compensation network with multi-granularity constraints (RaCMC) for fake news detection, that aims to sufficiently interact and fuse cross-modal features while amplifying the differences between real and fake news. First, a multiscale residual-aware compensation module is designed to interact and fuse features at different scales, and ensure both the consistency and exclusivity of feature interaction, thus acquiring high-quality features. Second, a multi-granularity constraints module is implemented to limit the distribution of both the news overall and the image-text pairs within the news, thus amplifying the differences between real and fake news at the news and feature levels. Finally, a dominant feature fusion reasoning module is developed to comprehensively evaluate news authenticity from the perspectives of both consistency and inconsistency. Experiments on three public datasets, including Weibo17, Politifact and GossipCop, reveal the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pufan Zou, Shijia Zhao, Weijie Huang, Qiming Xia, Chenglu Wen, Wei Li, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) have shown a remarkable generalization performance in 3D perception tasks. However, their effectiveness in large-scale outdoor datasets remains constrained by the scarcity of accurate supervision signals, the extensive noise caused by variable outdoor conditions, and the abundance of unknown objects. In this work, we propose a novel label-free learning method, Adaptive Label Correction (AdaCo), for 3D semantic segmentation. AdaCo first introduces the Cross-modal Label Generation Module (CLGM), providing cross-modal supervision with the formidable interpretive capabilities of the VFMs. Subsequently, AdaCo incorporates the Adaptive Noise Corrector (ANC), updating and adjusting the noisy samples within this supervision iteratively during training. Moreover, we develop an Adaptive Robust Loss (ARL) function to modulate each sample's sensitivity to noisy supervision, preventing potential underfitting issues associated with robust loss. Our proposed AdaCo can effectively mitigate the performance limitations of label-free learning networks in 3D semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on two outdoor benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojun Choi, Junsuk Choe, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) develops methods for testing unseen categories by aligning object region embeddings with corresponding VLM features. A recent study leverages the idea that VLMs implicitly learn compositional structures of semantic concepts within the image. Instead of using an individual region embedding, it utilizes a bag of region embeddings as a new representation to incorporate compositional structures into the OVD task. However, this approach often fails to capture the contextual concepts of each region, leading to noisy compositional structures. This results in only marginal performance improvements and reduced efficiency. To address this, we propose a novel concept-based alignment method that samples a more powerful and efficient compositional structure. Our approach groups contextually related ``concepts'' into a bag and adjusts the scale of concepts within the bag for more effective embedding alignment. Combined with Faster R-CNN, our method achieves improvements of 2.6 box AP50 and 0.5 mask AP over prior work on novel categories in the open-vocabulary COCO and LVIS benchmarks. Furthermore, our method reduces CLIP computation in FLOPs by 80.3% compared to previous research, significantly enhancing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the OVD datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxiao Yin, Wei Tao, Dongyue Zhao, Tadayuki Ito, Kinya Osa, Masami Kato, Tse-Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: U-Net models with encoder, decoder, and skip-connections components have demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of vision tasks. The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohao Liu, Xiaobo Xia, Zhuo Huang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ye, Xinyuan Ru, Shiming Chen, Yaochu Jin, Kaizhu Huang, Xiaobo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature Generative Adversarial Networks have emerged as powerful generative models in producing high-quality representations of unseen classes within the scope of Zero-shot Learning (ZSL). This paper delves into the pivotal influence of unseen class priors within the framework of transductive ZSL (TZSL) and illuminates the finding that even a marginal prior bias can result in substantial accuracy declines. Our extensive analysis uncovers that this inefficacy fundamentally stems from the utilization of an unconditional unseen discriminator - a core component in existing TZSL. We further establish that the detrimental effects of this component are inevitable unless the generator perfectly fits class-specific distributions. Building on these insights, we introduce our Improved Feature Generation Framework, termed I-VAEGAN, which incorporates two novel components: Pseudo-conditional Feature Adversarial (PFA) learning and Variational Embedding Regression (VER). PFA circumvents the need for prior estimation by explicitly injecting the predicted semantics as pseudo conditions for unseen classes premised by precise semantic regression. Meanwhile, VER utilizes reconstructive pre-training to learn class statistics, obtaining better semantic regression. Our I-VAEGAN achieves state-of-the-art TZSL accuracy across various benchmarks and priors. Our code would be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaechul Roh, Andrew Yuan, Jinsong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images that align closely with textual descriptions. However, this progress has also raised concerns about their misuse for propaganda and other malicious activities. Recent studies reveal that attackers can embed biases into these models through simple fine-tuning, causing them to generate targeted imagery when triggered by specific phrases. This underscores the potential for T2I models to act as tools for disseminating propaganda, producing images aligned with an attacker's objective for end-users.
  Building on this concept, we introduce FameBias, a T2I biasing attack that manipulates the embeddings of input prompts to generate images featuring specific public figures. Unlike prior methods, Famebias operates solely on the input embedding vectors without requiring additional model training. We evaluate FameBias comprehensively using Stable Diffusion V2, generating a large corpus of images based on various trigger nouns and target public figures. Our experiments demonstrate that FameBias achieves a high attack success rate while preserving the semantic context of the original prompts across multiple trigger-target pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushu Li, Yongyi Su, Adam Goodge, Kui Jia, Xun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have revolutionized machine learning by leveraging large pre-trained models to tackle various downstream tasks. Despite improvements in label, training, and data efficiency, many state-of-the-art VLMs still require task-specific hyperparameter tuning and fail to fully exploit test samples. To overcome these challenges, we propose a graph-based approach for label-efficient adaptation and inference. Our method dynamically constructs a graph over text prompts, few-shot examples, and test samples, using label propagation for inference without task-specific tuning. Unlike existing zero-shot label propagation techniques, our approach requires no additional unlabeled support set and effectively leverages the test sample manifold through dynamic graph expansion. We further introduce a context-aware feature re-weighting mechanism to improve task adaptation accuracy. Additionally, our method supports efficient graph expansion, enabling real-time inductive inference. Extensive evaluations on downstream tasks, such as fine-grained categorization and out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop an MLLM that understands and solves questions by learning to create each intermediate step of the reasoning involved till the final answer. To this end, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS), a new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the concept of collective learning into ``tree search'' for effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four iterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning, Backpropagation, and Selection. Using CoMCTS, we construct Mulberry-260k, a multimodal dataset with a tree of rich, explicit and well-defined reasoning nodes for each question. With Mulberry-260k, we perform collective SFT to train our model, Mulberry, a series of MLLMs with o1-like step-by-step Reasoning and Reflection capabilities.

<p>Abstract: This study mainly explores the application of natural gesture recognition based on computer vision in human-computer interaction, aiming to improve the fluency and naturalness of human-computer interaction through gesture recognition technology. In the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality and smart home, traditional input methods have gradually failed to meet the needs of users for interactive experience. As an intuitive and convenient interaction method, gestures have received more and more attention. This paper proposes a gesture recognition method based on a three-dimensional hand skeleton model. By simulating the three-dimensional spatial distribution of hand joints, a simplified hand skeleton structure is constructed. By connecting the palm and each finger joint, a dynamic and static gesture model of the hand is formed, which further improves the accuracy and efficiency of gesture recognition. Experimental results show that this method can effectively recognize various gestures and maintain high recognition accuracy and real-time response capabilities in different environments. In addition, combined with multimodal technologies such as eye tracking, the intelligence level of the gesture recognition system can be further improved, bringing a richer and more intuitive user experience. In the future, with the continuous development of computer vision, deep learning and multimodal interaction technology, natural interaction based on gestures will play an important role in a wider range of application scenarios and promote revolutionary progress in human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) is a challenging task requiring models to accurately predict familiar categories while minimizing confidence for unknown categories to effectively reject them in unseen domains. While the OSDG field has seen considerable advancements, the impact of label noise--a common issue in real-world datasets--has been largely overlooked. Label noise can mislead model optimization, thereby exacerbating the challenges of open-set recognition in novel domains. In this study, we take the first step towards addressing Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) by constructing dedicated benchmarks derived from widely used OSDG datasets, including PACS and DigitsDG. We evaluate baseline approaches by integrating techniques from both label denoising and OSDG methodologies, highlighting the limitations of existing strategies in handling label noise effectively. To address these limitations, we propose HyProMeta, a novel framework that integrates hyperbolic category prototypes for label noise-aware meta-learning alongside a learnable new-category agnostic prompt designed to enhance generalization to unseen classes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of HyProMeta compared to state-of-the-art methods across the newly established benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yu, Xin Yang, Le Zhang, Hanlin Gu, Tianrui Li, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents RSGaussian, an innovative novel view synthesis (NVS) method for aerial remote sensing scenes that incorporate LiDAR point cloud as constraints into the 3D Gaussian Splatting method, which ensures that Gaussians grow and split along geometric benchmarks, addressing the overgrowth and floaters issues occurs.

Depth and plane consistency losses are incorporated into the loss function to guide Gaussians towards real depth and plane representations, significantly improving depth estimation accuracy. Experimental results indicate that our approach has achieved novel view synthesis that balances photo-realistic visual quality and high-precision geometric estimation under aerial remote sensing datasets.

The key insight of our approach is how to train such a model from unlabeled--but human-edited--video samples. We pose a pretext task that pseudo-labels segments in the training videos for their primary viewpoint (egocentric or exocentric), and then discovers the patterns between those view-switch moments on the one hand and the visual and spoken content in the how-to video on the other hand. Armed with this predictor, our model then takes an unseen multi-view video as input and orchestrates which viewpoint should be displayed when. We further introduce a few-shot training setting that permits steering the model towards a new data domain. We demonstrate our idea on a variety of real-world video from HowTo100M and Ego-Exo4D and rigorously validate its advantages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wu Xiaoping, Hu Jie, Wei Xiaoming</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JeongYeon Nam, Jinbae Im, Wonjae Kim, Taeho Kil</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models still frequently produce outputs misaligned with their inputs, evidenced by object hallucination in captioning and prompt misalignment in the text-to-image generation model. Recent studies have explored methods for identifying misaligned elements, aiming not only to enhance interpretability but also to improve model performance. However, current approaches primarily rely on large foundation models in a zero-shot manner or fine-tuned models with human annotations, which limits scalability due to significant computational costs. This work proposes a novel approach, dubbed CLIP4DM, for detecting dense misalignments from pre-trained CLIP, specifically focusing on pinpointing misaligned words between image and text. We carefully revamp the gradient-based attribution computation method, enabling negative gradient of individual text tokens to indicate misalignment. We also propose F-CLIPScore, which aggregates misaligned attributions with a global alignment score. We evaluate our method on various dense misalignment detection benchmarks, covering various image and text domains and misalignment types. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot models and competitive performance with fine-tuned models while maintaining superior efficiency. Our qualitative examples show that our method has a unique strength to detect entity-level objects, intangible objects, and attributes that can not be easily detected for existing works. We conduct ablation studies and analyses to highlight the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/naver-ai/CLIP4DM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18409">Re-assessing ImageNet: How aligned is its single-label assumption with its multi-label nature?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Esla Timothy Anzaku, Seyed Amir Mousavi, Arnout Van Messem, Wesley De Neve</p>
<p>Abstract: ImageNet, an influential dataset in computer vision, is traditionally evaluated using single-label classification, which assumes that an image can be adequately described by a single concept or label. However, this approach may not fully capture the complex semantics within the images available in ImageNet, potentially hindering the development of models that effectively learn these intricacies. This study critically examines the prevalent single-label benchmarking approach and advocates for a shift to multi-label benchmarking for ImageNet. This shift would enable a more comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of deep neural network (DNN) models. We analyze the effectiveness of pre-trained state-of-the-art DNNs on ImageNet and one of its variants, ImageNetV2. Studies in the literature have reported unexpected accuracy drops of 11% to 14% on ImageNetV2. Our findings show that these reported declines are largely attributable to a characteristic of the dataset that has not received sufficient attention -- the proportion of images with multiple labels. Taking this characteristic into account, the results of our experiments provide evidence that there is no substantial degradation in effectiveness on ImageNetV2. Furthermore, we acknowledge that ImageNet pre-trained models exhibit some capability at capturing the multi-label nature of the dataset even though they were trained under the single-label assumption. Consequently, we propose a new evaluation approach to augment existing approaches that assess this capability. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the multi-label nature of the ImageNet dataset during benchmarking. Failing to do so could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the effectiveness of DNNs and divert research efforts from addressing other substantial challenges related to the reliability and robustness of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qice Qin, Yuki Hirakawa, Ryotaro Shimizu, Takuya Furusawa, Edgar Simo-Serra</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation in the fashion domain has predominantly focused on preserving body characteristics or following input prompts, but little attention has been paid to improving the inherent fashionability of the output images. This paper presents a novel diffusion model-based approach that generates fashion images with improved fashionability while maintaining control over key attributes. Key components of our method include: 1) fashionability enhancement, which ensures that the generated images are more fashionable than the input; 2) preservation of body characteristics, encouraging the generated images to maintain the original shape and proportions of the input; and 3) automatic fashion optimization, which does not rely on manual input or external prompts. We also employ two methods to collect training data for guidance while generating and evaluating the images. In particular, we rate outfit images using fashionability scores annotated by multiple fashion experts through OpenSkill-based and five critical aspect-based pairwise comparisons. These methods provide complementary perspectives for assessing and improving the fashionability of the generated images. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baseline Fashion++ in generating images with superior fashionability, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing more stylish and appealing fashion images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatiana Zemskova, Dmitry Yudin</p>
<p>Abstract: A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model, storing information about the objects and the semantic relationships between them, making its use promising for robotic tasks. When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph. The learnable representation is used as input for LLMs to perform 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, RIORefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of this approach over baseline methods that do not use information about the semantic relationships between objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojiao Guo, Yihang Dong, Xuhang Chen, Weiwen Chen, Zimeng Li, FuChen Zheng, Chi-Man Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater Image Restoration (UIR) remains a challenging task in computer vision due to the complex degradation of images in underwater environments. While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency. This work provides new insights into the potential of CNN-based approaches for challenging image restoration tasks in underwater environments.

<p>Abstract: African agriculture is undergoing rapid transformation. Annual maps of crop fields are key to understanding the nature of this transformation, but such maps are currently lacking and must be developed using advanced machine learning models trained on high resolution remote sensing imagery. To enable the development of such models, we delineated field boundaries in 33,746 Planet images captured between 2017 and 2023 across the continent using a custom labeling platform with built-in procedures for assessing and mitigating label error. We collected 42,403 labels, including 7,204 labels arising from tasks dedicated to assessing label quality (Class 1 labels), 32,167 from sites mapped once by a single labeller (Class 2) and 3,032 labels from sites where 3 or more labellers were tasked to map the same location (Class 4). Class 1 labels were used to calculate labeller-specific quality scores, while Class 1 and 4 sites mapped by at least 3 labellers were used to further evaluate label uncertainty using a Bayesian risk metric. Quality metrics showed that label quality was moderately high (0.75) for measures of total field extent, but low regarding the number of individual fields delineated (0.33), and the position of field edges (0.05). These values are expected when delineating small-scale fields in 3-5 m resolution imagery, which can be too coarse to reliably distinguish smaller fields, particularly in dense croplands, and therefore requires substantial labeller judgement. Nevertheless, previous work shows that such labels can train effective field mapping models. Furthermore, this large, probabilistic sample on its own provides valuable insight into regional agricultural characteristics, highlighting variations in the median field size and density. The imagery and vectorized labels along with quality information is available for download from two public repositories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James E. Gallagher, Edward J. Oughton</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Visual Optical Recognition Telemetry EXtraction (VORTEX) system for extracting and analyzing drone telemetry data from First Person View (FPV) Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) footage. VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Hamdan, Abderrahmane Rahiche, Mohamed Cheriet</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning, current Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems struggle with the inherent complexity of historical documents, including diverse writing styles, degraded text quality, and computational efficiency requirements across multiple languages and time periods. This paper introduces HTR-JAND (HTR-JAND: Handwritten Text Recognition with Joint Attention Network and Knowledge Distillation), an efficient HTR framework that combines advanced feature extraction with knowledge distillation. Our architecture incorporates three key components: (1) a CNN architecture integrating FullGatedConv2d layers with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for adaptive feature extraction, (2) a Combined Attention mechanism fusing Multi-Head Self-Attention with Proxima Attention for robust sequence modeling, and (3) a Knowledge Distillation framework enabling efficient model compression while preserving accuracy through curriculum-based training. The HTR-JAND framework implements a multi-stage training approach combining curriculum learning, synthetic data generation, and multi-task learning for cross-dataset knowledge transfer. We enhance recognition accuracy through context-aware T5 post-processing, particularly effective for historical documents. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate HTR-JAND's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art Character Error Rates (CER) of 1.23\%, 1.02\%, and 2.02\% on IAM, RIMES, and Bentham datasets respectively. Our Student model achieves a 48\% parameter reduction (0.75M versus 1.5M parameters) while maintaining competitive performance through efficient knowledge transfer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Shen, Xiu-Shen Wei, Yifan Sun, Yuxin Song, Tao Yuan, Jian Jin, Heyang Xu, Yazhou Yao, Errui Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer Vision (CV) has yet to fully achieve the zero-shot task generalization observed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), despite following many of the milestones established in NLP, such as large transformer models, extensive pre-training, and the auto-regression paradigm, among others. In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input $\to$ explanatory instruction $\to$ output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks. Code and dataset will be openly available on our GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advances in neural rendering, due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D datasets and the inherent limitations of multi-view diffusion models, view synthesis and 3D model generation are restricted to low resolutions with suboptimal multi-view consistency. In this study, we present a novel 3D enhancement pipeline, dubbed 3DEnhancer, which employs a multi-view latent diffusion model to enhance coarse 3D inputs while preserving multi-view consistency. Our method includes a pose-aware encoder and a diffusion-based denoiser to refine low-quality multi-view images, along with data augmentation and a multi-view attention module with epipolar aggregation to maintain consistent, high-quality 3D outputs across views. Unlike existing video-based approaches, our model supports seamless multi-view enhancement with improved coherence across diverse viewing angles. Extensive evaluations show that 3DEnhancer significantly outperforms existing methods, boosting both multi-view enhancement and per-instance 3D optimization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anselm Krainovic, Stefan Ruschke, Reinhard Heckel</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based 3D imaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is challenging because of limited availability of 3D training data. Therefore, 2D diffusion models trained on 2D slices are starting to be leveraged for 3D MRI reconstruction. However, as we show in this paper, existing methods pertain to a fixed voxel size, and performance degrades when the voxel size is varied, as it is often the case in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose and study several approaches for resolution-robust 3D MRI reconstruction with 2D diffusion priors. As a result of this investigation, we obtain a simple resolution-robust variational 3D reconstruction approach based on diffusion-guided regularization of randomly sampled 2D slices. This method provides competitive reconstruction quality compared to posterior sampling baselines. Towards resolving the sensitivity to resolution-shifts, we investigate state-of-the-art model-based approaches including Gaussian splatting, neural representations, and infinite-dimensional diffusion models, as well as a simple data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on several resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that the model-based approaches fail to close the performance gap in 3D MRI. In contrast, the data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on various resolutions effectively provides a resolution-robust method without compromising accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Balasubramanian, Ammu Abhishek, Yedu Krishna, Darshan Gera</p>
<p>Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious medical condition that presents significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in settings with limited access to healthcare resources. Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for visualizing the GI tract, but it requires time-consuming manual analysis by experienced gastroenterologists, which is prone to human error and inefficient given the increasing number of patients.To address this challenge, we propose ClassifyViStA, an AI-based framework designed for the automated detection and classification of bleeding and non-bleeding frames from WCE videos. The model consists of a standard classification path, augmented by two specialized branches: an implicit attention branch and a segmentation branch.The attention branch focuses on the bleeding regions, while the segmentation branch generates accurate segmentation masks, which are used for classification and interpretability. The model is built upon an ensemble of ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures to enhance classification performance. For the bleeding region detection, we implement a Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS) approach with YOLOv8, which improves the handling of overlapping bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate and nuanced detections.The system's interpretability is enhanced by using the segmentation masks to explain the classification results, offering insights into the decision-making process similar to the way a gastroenterologist identifies bleeding regions. Our approach not only automates the detection of GI bleeding but also provides an interpretable solution that can ease the burden on healthcare professionals and improve diagnostic efficiency. Our code is available at ClassifyViStA.</p>

We introduce LatentCRF, a continuous Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, implemented as a neural network layer, that models the spatial and semantic relationships among the latent vectors in the LDM. By replacing some of the computationally-intensive LDM inference iterations with our lightweight LatentCRF, we achieve a superior balance between quality, speed and diversity. We increase inference efficiency by 33% with no loss in image quality or diversity compared to the full LDM. LatentCRF is an easy add-on, which does not require modifying the LDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghong Cai, Xiaodong Cun, Xiaoyu Li, Wenze Liu, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yong Zhang, Ying Shan, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-scene interaction (HSI) generation is crucial for applications in embodied AI, virtual reality, and robotics. While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tahira Kazimi, Ritika Allada, Pinar Yanardag</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifiers are important components in many computer vision tasks, serving as the foundational backbone of a wide variety of models employed across diverse applications. However, understanding the decision-making process of classifiers remains a significant challenge. We propose DiffEx, a novel method that leverages the capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models to explain classifier decisions. Unlike traditional GAN-based explainability models, which are limited to simple, single-concept analyses and typically require training a new model for each classifier, our approach can explain classifiers that focus on single concepts (such as faces or animals) as well as those that handle complex scenes involving multiple concepts. DiffEx employs vision-language models to create a hierarchical list of semantics, allowing users to identify not only the overarching semantic influences on classifiers (e.g., the 'beard' semantic in a facial classifier) but also their sub-types, such as 'goatee' or 'Balbo' beard. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffEx is able to cover a significantly broader spectrum of semantics compared to its GAN counterparts, providing a hierarchical tool that delivers a more detailed and fine-grained understanding of classifier decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orientation is a key attribute of objects, crucial for understanding their spatial pose and arrangement in images. However, practical solutions for accurate orientation estimation from a single image remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Orient Anything, the first expert and foundational model designed to estimate object orientation in a single- and free-view image. Due to the scarcity of labeled data, we propose extracting knowledge from the 3D world. By developing a pipeline to annotate the front face of 3D objects and render images from random views, we collect 2M images with precise orientation annotations. To fully leverage the dataset, we design a robust training objective that models the 3D orientation as probability distributions of three angles and predicts the object orientation by fitting these distributions. Besides, we employ several strategies to improve synthetic-to-real transfer. Our model achieves state-of-the-art orientation estimation accuracy in both rendered and real images and exhibits impressive zero-shot ability in various scenarios. More importantly, our model enhances many applications, such as comprehension and generation of complex spatial concepts and 3D object pose adjustment.</p>

<p>Abstract: World model-based searching and planning are widely recognized as a promising path toward human-level physical intelligence. However, current driving world models primarily rely on video diffusion models, which specialize in visual generation but lack the flexibility to incorporate other modalities like action. In contrast, autoregressive transformers have demonstrated exceptional capability in modeling multimodal data. Our work aims to unify both driving model simulation and trajectory planning into a single sequence modeling problem. We introduce a multimodal driving language based on interleaved image and action tokens, and develop DrivingGPT to learn joint world modeling and planning through standard next-token prediction. Our DrivingGPT demonstrates strong performance in both action-conditioned video generation and end-to-end planning, outperforming strong baselines on large-scale nuPlan and NAVSIM benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Chen, Roman Shapovalov, Iro Laina, Tom Monnier, Jianyuan Wang, David Novotny, Andrea Vedaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Text- or image-to-3D generators and 3D scanners can now produce 3D assets with high-quality shapes and textures. These assets typically consist of a single, fused representation, like an implicit neural field, a Gaussian mixture, or a mesh, without any useful structure. However, most applications and creative workflows require assets to be made of several meaningful parts that can be manipulated independently. To address this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach that generates 3D objects composed of meaningful parts starting from text, an image, or an unstructured 3D object. First, given multiple views of a 3D object, generated or rendered, a multi-view diffusion model extracts a set of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, dividing the object into parts. Then, a second multi-view diffusion model takes each part separately, fills in the occlusions, and uses those completed views for 3D reconstruction by feeding them to a 3D reconstruction network. This completion process considers the context of the entire object to ensure that the parts integrate cohesively. The generative completion model can make up for the information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate entirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset. We evaluate our method on generated and real 3D assets and show that it outperforms segmentation and part-extraction baselines by a large margin. We also showcase downstream applications such as 3D part editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Yi, Syed Talal Wasim, Yanan Luo, Muzammal Naseer, Juergen Gall</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an efficient encoder-free approach for video-language understanding that achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Current video-language models typically rely on heavyweight image encoders (300M-1.1B parameters) or video encoders (1B-1.4B parameters), creating a substantial computational burden when processing multi-frame videos. Our method introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) that directly processes video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders while using only 45M parameters for visual processing - at least a 6.5$\times$ reduction compared to traditional approaches. The STAB architecture combines Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding for fine-grained feature extraction, efficient spatial downsampling through learned attention and separate mechanisms for modeling frame-level and video-level relationships. Our model achieves comparable or superior performance to encoder-based approaches for open-ended video question answering on standard benchmarks. The fine-grained video question-answering evaluation demonstrates our model's effectiveness, outperforming the encoder-based approaches Video-ChatGPT and Video-LLaVA in key aspects like correctness and temporal understanding. Extensive ablation studies validate our architectural choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of our spatio-temporal modeling approach while achieving 3-4$\times$ faster processing speeds than previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kris Kraack</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional psychological evaluations rely heavily on human observation and interpretation, which are prone to subjectivity, bias, fatigue, and inconsistency. To address these limitations, this work presents a multimodal emotion recognition system that provides a standardised, objective, and data-driven tool to support evaluators, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinicians. The system integrates recognition of facial expressions, speech, spoken language, and body movement analysis to capture subtle emotional cues that are often overlooked in human evaluations. By combining these modalities, the system provides more robust and comprehensive emotional state assessment, reducing the risk of mis- and overdiagnosis. Preliminary testing in a simulated real-world condition demonstrates the system's potential to provide reliable emotional insights to improve the diagnostic accuracy. This work highlights the promise of automated multimodal analysis as a valuable complement to traditional psychological evaluation practices, with applications in clinical and therapeutic settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepthi Pavurala, Duoduo Liao, Chaithra Reddy Pasunuru</p>
<p>Abstract: This pilot study presents a novel, automated, and scalable methodology for detecting and evaluating subsurface defect-prone regions in concrete slabs using Impact Echo (IE) signal analysis. The approach integrates advanced signal processing, clustering, and visual analytics to identify subsurface anomalies. A unique adaptive thresholding method tailors frequency-based defect identification to the distinct material properties of each slab. The methodology generates frequency maps, binary masks, and k-means cluster maps to automatically classify defect and non-defect regions. Key visualizations, including 3D surface plots, cluster maps, and contour plots, are employed to analyze spatial frequency distributions and highlight structural anomalies. The study utilizes a labeled dataset constructed at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Advanced Sensing Technology Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory. Evaluations involve ground-truth masking, comparing the generated defect maps with top-view binary masks derived from the information provided by the FHWA. The performance metrics, specifically F1-scores and AUC-ROC, achieve values of up to 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. The results demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, consistently identifying defect-prone areas with minimal false positives and few missed defects. Adaptive frequency thresholding ensures flexibility in addressing variations across slabs, providing a scalable framework for detecting structural anomalies. Additionally, the methodology is adaptable to other frequency-based signals due to its generalizable thresholding mechanism and holds potential for integrating multimodal sensor fusion. This automated and scalable pipeline minimizes manual intervention, ensuring accurate and efficient defect detection, further advancing Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully utilized in the medical diagnosis of many illnesses. Nevertheless, identifying the optimal architecture and hyperparameters among the available possibilities might be a substantial challenge. Typically, CNN hyperparameter selection is performed manually. Nonetheless, this is a computationally costly procedure, as numerous rounds of hyperparameter settings must be evaluated to determine which produces the best results. Choosing the proper hyperparameter settings has always been a crucial and challenging task, as it depends on the researcher's knowledge and experience. This study will present work done in recent years on the usage of metaheuristic optimization algorithms in the CNN optimization process. It looks at a number of recent studies that focus on the use of optimization methods to optimize hyperparameters in order to find high-performing CNNs. This helps researchers figure out how to set hyperparameters efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qusay Shihab Hamad, Hussein Samma, Shahrel Azmin Suandi</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer detection based on pre-trained convolution neural network (CNN) has gained much interest among other conventional computer-based systems. In the past few years, CNN technology has been the most promising way to find cancer in mammogram scans. In this paper, the effect of layer freezing in a pre-trained CNN is investigated for breast cancer detection by classifying mammogram images as benign or malignant. Different VGG19 scenarios have been examined based on the number of convolution layer blocks that have been frozen. There are a total of six scenarios in this study. The primary benefits of this research are twofold: it improves the model's ability to detect breast cancer cases and it reduces the training time of VGG19 by freezing certain layers.To evaluate the performance of these scenarios, 1693 microbiological images of benign and malignant breast cancers were utilized. According to the reported results, the best recognition rate was obtained from a frozen first block of VGG19 with a sensitivity of 95.64 %, while the training of the entire VGG19 yielded 94.48%.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the most elusive goals in myographic prosthesis control is the ability to reliably decode continuous positions simultaneously across multiple degrees-of-freedom. Goal: To demonstrate dexterous, natural, biomimetic finger and wrist control of the highly advanced robotic Modular Prosthetic Limb. Methods: We combine sequential temporal regression models and reinforcement learning using myographic signals to predict continuous simultaneous predictions of 7 finger and wrist degrees-of-freedom for 9 non-amputee human subjects in a minimally-constrained freeform training process. Results: We demonstrate highly dexterous 7 DoF position-based regression for prosthesis control from EMG signals, with significantly lower error rates than traditional approaches (p < 0.001) and nearly zero prediction response time delay (p < 0.001). Their performance can be continuously improved at any time using our freeform reinforcement process. Significance: We have demonstrated the most dexterous, biomimetic, and natural prosthesis control performance ever obtained from the surface EMG signal. Our reinforcement approach allowed us to abandon standard training protocols and simply allow the subject to move in any desired way while our models adapt. Conclusions: This work redefines the state-of-the-art in myographic decoding in terms of the reliability, responsiveness, and movement complexity available from prosthesis control systems. The present-day emergence and convergence of advanced algorithmic methods, experiment protocols, dexterous robotic prostheses, and sensor modalities represents a unique opportunity to finally realize our ultimate goal of achieving fully restorative natural upper-limb function for amputees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuting Lan, Mingliang Zhou, Jielu Yan, Xuekai Wei, Yueting Huang, Zhaowei Shang, Huayan Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Given that the factors influencing image quality vary significantly with scene, content, and distortion type, particularly in the context of regional heterogeneity, we propose an adaptive multi-quality factor (AMqF) framework to represent image quality in a dictionary space, enabling the precise capture of quality features in non-uniformly distorted regions. By designing an adapter, the framework can flexibly decompose quality factors (such as brightness, structure, contrast, etc.) that best align with human visual perception and quantify them into discrete visual words. These visual words respond to the constructed dictionary basis vector, and by obtaining the corresponding coordinate vectors, we can measure visual similarity. Our method offers two key contributions. First, an adaptive mechanism that extracts and decomposes quality factors according to human visual perception principles enhances their representation ability through reconstruction constraints. Second, the construction of a comprehensive and discriminative dictionary space and basis vector allows quality factors to respond effectively to the dictionary basis vector and capture non-uniform distortion patterns in images, significantly improving the accuracy of visual similarity measurement. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in handling various types of distorted images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihao Liu, Yibo Yang, Xiaojie Li, David A. Clifton, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Online continual learning (OCL) seeks to learn new tasks from data streams that appear only once, while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. Most existing methods rely on replay, focusing on enhancing memory retention through regularization or distillation. However, they often overlook the adaptability of the model, limiting the ability to learn generalizable and discriminative features incrementally from online training data. To address this, we introduce a plug-and-play module, S6MOD, which can be integrated into most existing methods and directly improve adaptability. Specifically, S6MOD introduces an extra branch after the backbone, where a mixture of discretization selectively adjusts parameters in a selective state space model, enriching selective scan patterns such that the model can adaptively select the most sensitive discretization method for current dynamics. We further design a class-conditional routing algorithm for dynamic, uncertainty-based adjustment and implement a contrastive discretization loss to optimize it. Extensive experiments combining our module with various models demonstrate that S6MOD significantly enhances model adaptability, leading to substantial performance gains and achieving the state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: General-purposed embodied agents are designed to understand the users' natural instructions or intentions and act precisely to complete universal tasks. Recently, methods based on foundation models especially Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have shown a substantial potential to solve language-conditioned manipulation (LCM) tasks well. However, existing benchmarks do not adequately meet the needs of VLAs and relative algorithms. To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Usman Ali, Waqas Ali, Umer Ramzan</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of faults in induction motors is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted operations in industrial settings. Among the various fault types encountered in induction motors, bearing, rotor, and stator faults are the most prevalent. This paper introduces a Weighted Probability Ensemble Deep Learning (WPEDL) methodology, tailored for effectively diagnosing induction motor faults using high-dimensional data extracted from vibration and current features. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to extract features from both vibration and current signals. The performance of the WPEDL fault diagnosis method is compared against conventional deep learning models, demonstrating the superior efficacy of the proposed system. The multi-class fault diagnosis system based on WPEDL achieves high accuracies across different fault types: 99.05% for bearing (vibrational signal), 99.10%, and 99.50% for rotor (current and vibration signal), and 99.60%, and 99.52% for stator faults (current and vibration signal) respectively. To evaluate the robustness of our multi-class classification decisions, tests have been conducted on a combined dataset of 52,000 STFT images encompassing all three faults. Our proposed model outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 98.89%. The findings underscore the effectiveness and reliability of the WPEDL approach for early-stage fault diagnosis in IMs, offering promising insights for enhancing industrial operational efficiency and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention mechanism has been extensively integrated within mainstream neural network architectures, such as Transformers and graph attention networks. Yet, its underlying working principles remain somewhat elusive. What is its essence? Are there any connections between it and traditional machine learning algorithms? In this study, we inspect the process of computing similarity using classic metrics and vector space properties in manifold learning, clustering, and supervised learning. We identify the key characteristics of similarity computation and information propagation in these methods and demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism in deep learning adheres to the same principles but operates more flexibly and adaptively. We decompose the self-attention mechanism into a learnable pseudo-metric function and an information propagation process based on similarity computation. We prove that the self-attention mechanism converges to a drift-diffusion process through continuous modeling provided the pseudo-metric is a transformation of a metric and certain reasonable assumptions hold. This equation could be transformed into a heat equation under a new metric. In addition, we give a first-order analysis of attention mechanism with a general pseudo-metric function. This study aids in understanding the effects and principle of attention mechanism through physical intuition. Finally, we propose a modified attention mechanism called metric-attention by leveraging the concept of metric learning to facilitate the ability to learn desired metrics more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms self-attention regarding training efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans naturally rely on floor plans to navigate in unfamiliar environments, as they are readily available, reliable, and provide rich geometrical guidance. However, existing visual navigation settings overlook this valuable prior knowledge, leading to limited efficiency and accuracy. To eliminate this gap, we introduce a novel navigation task: Floor Plan Visual Navigation (FloNa), the first attempt to incorporate floor plan into embodied visual navigation. While the floor plan offers significant advantages, two key challenges emerge: (1) handling the spatial inconsistency between the floor plan and the actual scene layout for collision-free navigation, and (2) aligning observed images with the floor plan sketch despite their distinct modalities. To address these challenges, we propose FloDiff, a novel diffusion policy framework incorporating a localization module to facilitate alignment between the current observation and the floor plan. We further collect $20k$ navigation episodes across $117$ scenes in the iGibson simulator to support the training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in unfamiliar scenes using floor plan knowledge. Project website: https://gauleejx.github.io/flona/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Wang, Yanxin Cai, Jiayi Zhou, Yangming Zhang, Tianyu Li, Wei Li, Xun Liu, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing field of remote sensing faces a challenge: the ever-increasing size and volume of imagery data are exceeding the storage and transmission capabilities of satellite platforms. Efficient compression of remote sensing imagery is a critical solution to alleviate these burdens on satellites. However, existing compression methods are often too computationally expensive for satellites. With the continued advancement of compressed sensing theory, single-pixel imaging emerges as a powerful tool that brings new possibilities for on-orbit image compression. However, it still suffers from prolonged imaging times and the inability to perform high-resolution imaging, hindering its practical application. This paper advances the study of compressed sensing in remote sensing image compression, proposing Block Modulated Imaging (BMI). By requiring only a single exposure, BMI significantly enhances imaging acquisition speeds. Additionally, BMI obviates the need for digital micromirror devices and surpasses limitations in image resolution. Furthermore, we propose a novel decoding network specifically designed to reconstruct images compressed under the BMI framework. Leveraging the gated 3D convolutions and promoting efficient information flow across stages through a Two-Way Cross-Attention module, our decoding network exhibits demonstrably superior reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple renowned remote sensing datasets unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. To further validate its practical applicability, we developed and tested a prototype of the BMI-based camera, which has shown promising potential for on-orbit image compression.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Meng, Michael Fulham, Lei Bi, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration is a fundamental requirement for medical image analysis. Recently, transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based registration methods for their ability to capture long-range dependency via self-attention (SA). However, the high computation and memory loads of SA (growing quadratically with the spatial resolution) hinder transformers from processing subtle textural information in high-resolution image features, e.g., at the full and half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as the high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise pixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical structures. Cross-covariance Attention (XCA), as a "transposed" version of SA that operates across feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with the spatial resolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependency among high-resolution image features. However, existing XCA-based transformers merely capture coarse global long-range dependency, which are unsuitable for deformable image registration relying primarily on fine-grained local correspondence. In this study, we propose to improve existing deep learning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this end, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable medical image registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). Our MAXCA serves as a general network block that can be embedded into various registration network architectures. It can capture both global and local long-range dependency among high-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel via a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked inter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical datasets demonstrate that our MAXCA block enables state-of-the-art registration performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects, improving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we have developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including Text-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our synthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology.</p>

<p>Abstract: While weakly supervised multi-view face reconstruction (MVR) is garnering increased attention, one critical issue still remains open: how to effectively interact and fuse multiple image information to reconstruct high-precision 3D models. In this regard, we propose a novel pipeline called Deep Fusion MVR (DF-MVR) to explore the feature correspondences between multi-view images and reconstruct high-precision 3D faces. Specifically, we present a novel multi-view feature fusion backbone that utilizes face masks to align features from multiple encoders and integrates one multi-layer attention mechanism to enhance feature interaction and fusion, resulting in one unified facial representation. Additionally, we develop one concise face mask mechanism that facilitates multi-view feature fusion and facial reconstruction by identifying common areas and guiding the network's focus on critical facial features (e.g., eyes, brows, nose, and mouth). Experiments on Pixel-Face and Bosphorus datasets indicate the superiority of our model. Without 3D annotation, DF-MVR achieves 5.2% and 3.0% RMSE improvement over the existing weakly supervised MVRs respectively on Pixel-Face and Bosphorus dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Yue, Miaojing Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeb Shin, Hyeonjun Jeong, Francois Rameau, Dongsuk Kum</p>
<p>Abstract: For scalable autonomous driving, a robust map-based localization system, independent of GPS, is fundamental. To achieve such map-based localization, online high-definition (HD) map construction plays a significant role in accurate estimation of the pose. Although recent advancements in online HD map construction have predominantly investigated on vectorized representation due to its effectiveness, they suffer from computational cost and fixed parametric model, which limit scalability. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel HD map learning framework that leverages graph modeling. This framework is designed to learn the construction of diverse geometric shapes, thereby enhancing the scalability of HD map construction. Our approach involves representing the map elements as an instance-level graph by decomposing them into vertices and edges to facilitate accurate and efficient end-to-end vectorized HD map learning. Furthermore, we introduce an association strategy using a Graph Neural Network to efficiently handle the complex geometry of various map elements, while maintaining scalability. Comprehensive experiments on public open dataset show that our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art model by $1.6$ mAP. We further showcase the superior scalability of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving a $4.8$ mAP improvement in long range configuration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Ruijie Quan, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models~(VLMs) are the de-facto foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, scene text recognition methods still prefer backbones pre-trained on a single modality, namely, the visual modality, despite the potential of VLMs to serve as powerful scene text readers. For example, CLIP can robustly identify regular (horizontal) and irregular (rotated, curved, blurred, or occluded) text in images. With such merits, we transform CLIP into a scene text reader and introduce CLIP4STR, a simple yet effective STR method built upon image and text encoders of CLIP. It has two encoder-decoder branches: a visual branch and a cross-modal branch. The visual branch provides an initial prediction based on the visual feature, and the cross-modal branch refines this prediction by addressing the discrepancy between the visual feature and text semantics. To fully leverage the capabilities of both branches, we design a dual predict-and-refine decoding scheme for inference. We scale CLIP4STR in terms of the model size, pre-training data, and training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 13 STR benchmarks. Additionally, a comprehensive empirical study is provided to enhance the understanding of the adaptation of CLIP to STR. Our method establishes a simple yet strong baseline for future STR research with VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nokyung Park, Daewon Chae, Jeongyong Shim, Sangpil Kim, Eun-Sol Kim, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning domain-invariant visual representations is important to train a model that can generalize well to unseen target task domains. Recent works demonstrate that text descriptions contain high-level class-discriminative information and such auxiliary semantic cues can be used as effective pivot embedding for domain generalization problems. However, they use pivot embedding in a global manner (i.e., aligning an image embedding with sentence-level text embedding), which does not fully utilize the semantic cues of given text description. In this work, we advocate for the use of local alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions to get domain-invariant features. To this end, we first represent image and text inputs as graphs. We then cluster nodes within these graphs and match the graph-based image node features to the nodes of textual graphs. This matching process is conducted both globally and locally, tightly aligning visual and textual semantic sub-structures. We experiment with large-scale public datasets, such as CUB-DG and DomainBed, and our model achieves matched or better state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Y. Liu, L. Lin, K. K. Y. Wong, X. Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) has emerged as a solution to mitigate the conflict between annotation cost and model performance by adopting sparse annotation formats (e.g., point, scribble, block, etc.). Typical approaches attempt to exploit anatomy and topology priors to directly expand sparse annotations into pseudo-labels. However, due to a lack of attention to the ambiguous edges in medical images and insufficient exploration of sparse supervision, existing approaches tend to generate erroneous and overconfident pseudo proposals in noisy regions, leading to cumulative model error and performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel WSS approach, named ProCNS, encompassing two synergistic modules devised with the principles of progressive prototype calibration and noise suppression. Specifically, we design a Prototype-based Regional Spatial Affinity (PRSA) loss to maximize the pair-wise affinities between spatial and semantic elements, providing our model of interest with more reliable guidance. The affinities are derived from the input images and the prototype-refined predictions. Meanwhile, we propose an Adaptive Noise Perception and Masking (ANPM) module to obtain more enriched and representative prototype representations, which adaptively identifies and masks noisy regions within the pseudo proposals, reducing potential erroneous interference during prototype computation. Furthermore, we generate specialized soft pseudo-labels for the noisy regions identified by ANPM, providing supplementary supervision. Extensive experiments on six medical image segmentation tasks involving different modalities demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyuan Liu, Chen Chen, Songtao Wu, Fanyang Meng, Hong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing interactive actions, including hand-to-hand interaction and human-to-human interaction, has attracted increasing attention for various applications in the field of video analysis and human-robot interaction. Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Chen, Yiyuan Ge, Ziyang Wang, Jiaju Kang, Mingya Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) focuses on retrieving specific pedestrians when their clothing has changed, typically under the assumption that the entire pedestrian images are visible. Pedestrian images in real-world scenarios, however, are often partially obscured by obstacles, presenting a significant challenge to existing CC-ReID systems. In this paper, we introduce a more challenging task termed Occluded Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (OC4-ReID), which simultaneously addresses two challenges of clothing changes and occlusion. Concretely, we construct two new datasets, Occ-LTCC and Occ-PRCC, based on original CC-ReID datasets to include random occlusions of key pedestrians components (e.g., head, torso). Moreover, a novel benchmark is proposed for OC4-ReID incorporating a Train-Test Micro Granularity Screening (T2MGS) module to mitigate the influence of occlusion and proposing a Part-Robust Triplet (PRT) loss for partial features learning. Comprehensive experiments on the proposed datasets, as well as on two CC-ReID benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of proposed method against other state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jieyi Tan, Yansheng Li, Sergey A. Bartalev, Shinkarenko Stanislav, Bo Dang, Yongjun Zhang, Liangqi Yuan, Wei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation (RSS) is an essential technology in earth observation missions. Due to concerns over geographic information security, data privacy, storage bottleneck and industry competition, high-quality annotated remote sensing images are often isolated and distributed across institutions. The issue of remote sensing data islands poses challenges for fully utilizing isolated datasets to train a global model. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed collaborative learning technology, offers a potential solution to leverage isolated remote sensing data. Typically, remote sensing images from different institutions exhibit significant geographic heterogeneity, characterized by coupled class-distribution heterogeneity and object-appearance heterogeneity. However, existing FL methods lack consideration of them, leading to a decline in the performance of the global model when FL is directly applied to RSS. We propose a novel Geographic heterogeneity-aware Federated learning (GeoFed) framework to bridge data islands in RSS. Our framework consists of three modules, including the Global Insight Enhancement (GIE) module, the Essential Feature Mining (EFM) module and the Local-Global Balance (LoGo) module. Through the GIE module, class distribution heterogeneity is alleviated by introducing a prior global class distribution vector. We design an EFM module to alleviate object appearance heterogeneity by constructing essential features. Furthermore, the LoGo module enables the model to possess both global generalization capability and local adaptation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., FedFBP, FedCASID, FedInria) demonstrate that our GeoFed framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Binglin Chen, Yongsen Zheng, Lechao Cheng, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction is a crucial yet challenging spatial-temporal prediction task in urban computing, which aims to accurately forecast cross-station ridership for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we learn traffic evolution from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing spatial relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. Our code is available at https://github.com/KLatitude/ODMixer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushu Li, Yongyi Su, Xulei Yang, Kui Jia, Xun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches often adapt models with the unlabeled testing data stream. A recent attempt relaxed the assumption by introducing limited human annotation, referred to as Human-In-the-Loop Test-Time Adaptation (HILTTA) in this study. The focus of existing HILTTA studies lies in selecting the most informative samples to label, a.k.a. active learning. In this work, we are motivated by a pitfall of TTA, i.e. sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and propose to approach HILTTA by synergizing active learning and model selection. Specifically, we first select samples for human annotation (active learning) and then use the labeled data to select optimal hyper-parameters (model selection). To prevent the model selection process from overfitting to local distributions, multiple regularization techniques are employed to complement the validation objective. A sample selection strategy is further tailored by considering the balance between active learning and model selection purposes. We demonstrate on 5 TTA datasets that the proposed HILTTA approach is compatible with off-the-shelf TTA methods and such combinations substantially outperform the state-of-the-art HILTTA methods. Importantly, our proposed method can always prevent choosing the worst hyper-parameters on all off-the-shelf TTA methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Yushu-Li/HILTTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Trinh, Markus Heinonen, Luigi Acerbi, Samuel Kaski</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on clean images but struggle with corrupted ones. Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings. Notably, DAMP is able to train a ViT-S/16 on ImageNet from scratch, reaching the top-1 error of 23.7% which is comparable to ResNet50 without extensive data augmentations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how humans cooperatively rearrange household objects is critical for VR/AR and human-robot interaction. However, in-depth studies on modeling these behaviors are under-researched due to the lack of relevant datasets. We fill this gap by presenting CORE4D, a novel large-scale 4D human-object-human interaction dataset focusing on collaborative object rearrangement, which encompasses diverse compositions of various object geometries, collaboration modes, and 3D scenes. With 1K human-object-human motion sequences captured in the real world, we enrich CORE4D by contributing an iterative collaboration retargeting strategy to augment motions to a variety of novel objects. Leveraging this approach, CORE4D comprises a total of 11K collaboration sequences spanning 3K real and virtual object shapes. Benefiting from extensive motion patterns provided by CORE4D, we benchmark two tasks aiming at generating human-object interaction: human-object motion forecasting and interaction synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our collaboration retargeting strategy and indicate that CORE4D has posed new challenges to existing human-object interaction generation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixin Xu, Zhe Wang, Chunyun Chen, Xue Geng, Jie Lin, Mohamed M. Sabry Aly, Xulei Yang, Min Wu, Xiaoli Li, Weisi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or superior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings. Especially, we achieve up to 3.93x and 1.79x speedups on dedicated hardware and GPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and also observe an inference power reduction by 1.4x on real-world GPUs.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates unparalleled superior performance in 3D scene reconstruction. However, 3DGS heavily relies on the sharp images. Fulfilling this requirement can be challenging in real-world scenarios especially when the camera moves fast, which severely limits the application of 3DGS. To address these challenges, we proposed Spike Gausian Splatting (SpikeGS), the first framework that integrates the spike streams into 3DGS pipeline to reconstruct 3D scenes via a fast-moving bio-inspired camera. With accumulation rasterization, interval supervision, and a specially designed pipeline, SpikeGS extracts detailed geometry and texture from high temporal resolution but texture lacking spike stream, reconstructs 3D scenes captured in 1 second. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of SpikeGS compared with existing spike-based and deblur 3D scene reconstruction methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Liu, Wanqian Zhang, Dayan Wu, Zheng Lin, Jingzi Gu, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attack reconstructs the private training data of a target model given its output, posing a significant threat to deep learning models and data privacy. On one hand, most of existing MI methods focus on searching for latent codes to represent the target identity, yet this iterative optimization-based scheme consumes a huge number of queries to the target model, making it unrealistic especially in black-box scenario. On the other hand, some training-based methods launch an attack through a single forward inference, whereas failing to directly learn high-level mappings from prediction vectors to images. Addressing these limitations, we propose a novel Prediction-to-Image (P2I) method for black-box MI attack. Specifically, we introduce the Prediction Alignment Encoder to map the target model's output prediction into the latent code of StyleGAN. In this way, prediction vector space can be well aligned with the more disentangled latent space, thus establishing a connection between prediction vectors and the semantic facial features. During the attack phase, we further design the Aligned Ensemble Attack scheme to integrate complementary facial attributes of target identity for better reconstruction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other SOTAs, e.g.,compared with RLB-MI, our method improves attack accuracy by 8.5% and reduces query numbers by 99% on dataset CelebA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Rifat Raiyan, Zibran Zarif Amio, Sabbir Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Zhou, Chuang Wang, Rui Nie, Jinlin Liu, Dongdong Yu, Qian Yu, Changhu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial progress in diffusion-based controllable video generation. However, achieving precise control in complex scenarios, including fine-grained object parts, sophisticated motion trajectories, and coherent background movement, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce TrackGo, a novel approach that leverages free-form masks and arrows for conditional video generation. This method offers users with a flexible and precise mechanism for manipulating video content. We also propose the TrackAdapter for control implementation, an efficient and lightweight adapter designed to be seamlessly integrated into the temporal self-attention layers of a pretrained video generation model. This design leverages our observation that the attention map of these layers can accurately activate regions corresponding to motion in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new approach, enhanced by the TrackAdapter, achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics such as FVD, FID, and ObjMC scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alper Canberk, Maksym Bondarenko, Ege Ozguroglu, Ruoshi Liu, Carl Vondrick</p>
<p>Abstract: Creative processes such as painting often involve creating different components of an image one by one. Can we build a computational model to perform this task? Prior works often fail by making global changes to the image, inserting objects in unrealistic spatial locations, and generating inaccurate lighting details. We observe that while state-of-the-art models perform poorly on object insertion, they can remove objects and erase the background in natural images very well. Inverting the direction of object removal, we obtain high-quality data for learning to insert objects that are spatially, physically, and optically consistent with the surroundings. With this scalable automatic data generation pipeline, we can create a dataset for learning object insertion, which is used to train our proposed text conditioned diffusion model. Qualitative and quantitative experiments have shown that our model achieves state-of-the-art results in object insertion, particularly for in-the-wild images. We show compelling results on diverse insertion prompts and images across various domains.In addition, we automate iterative insertion by combining our insertion model with beam search guided by CLIP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Guo, Ruoxiang Xu, Rongcheng Li, Zhenghao Wu, Weifeng Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In extreme scenarios such as nighttime or low-visibility environments, achieving reliable perception is critical for applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Juanola, Gloria Haro, Magdalena Fuentes</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of Visual Sound Source Localization (VSSL) involves identifying the location of sound sources in visual scenes, integrating audio-visual data for enhanced scene understanding. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we observe three critical flaws: i) The evaluation of the models is mainly focused in sounds produced by objects that are visible in the image, ii) The evaluation often assumes a prior knowledge of the size of the sounding object, and iii) No universal threshold for localization in real-world scenarios is established, as previous approaches only consider positive examples without accounting for both positive and negative cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuong Le, Viktor Johansson, Manon Kok, Bastian Wandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yin Xie, Kaicheng Yang, Ninghua Yang, Weimo Deng, Xiangzi Dai, Tiancheng Gu, Yumeng Wang, Xiang An, Yongle Zhao, Ziyong Feng, Roy Miles, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing research primarily focuses on tuning language and image instructions, ignoring the critical pretraining phase where models learn to process textual and visual modalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for LMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically learnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part of the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we conceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a "foreign language" for the LLMs and propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and unidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding of visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task, leveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual semantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible data, we present a new foundation model called Croc. Experimental results demonstrate that Croc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on massive vision-language benchmarks. To support reproducibility and facilitate further research, we release the training code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/deepglint/Croc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Huangjie Zheng, Yi Gu, Zhendong Wang, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved SOTA performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, its ultimate performance is constrained by how accurate the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, allowing it to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when distilled from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method establishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models, achieving FID scores of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64. When distilling EDM2 models trained on ImageNet 512x512, our SiDA method surpasses even the largest teacher model, EDM2-XXL, which achieved an FID of 1.81 using classifier-free guidance (CFG) and 63 generation steps. In contrast, SiDA achieves FID scores of 2.156 for size XS, 1.669 for S, 1.488 for M, 1.413 for L, 1.379 for XL, and 1.366 for XXL, all without CFG and in a single generation step. These results highlight substantial improvements across all model sizes. Our code is available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD/tree/sida.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongmei Wang, Junlin Hou, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model performance. Comprehensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in concept detection and disease diagnosis tasks while providing diverse explanations to ensure model interpretability effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: This Paper presents an advanced approach for fine-tuning BiomedCLIP PubMedBERT, a multimodal model, to classify abnormalities in Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) frames, aiming to enhance diagnostic efficiency in gastrointestinal healthcare. By integrating the PubMedBERT language model with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to process endoscopic images, our method categorizes images into ten specific classes: angioectasia, bleeding, erosion, erythema, foreign body, lymphangiectasia, polyp, ulcer, worms, and normal. Our workflow incorporates image preprocessing and fine-tunes the BiomedCLIP model to generate high-quality embeddings for both visual and textual inputs, aligning them through similarity scoring for classification. Performance metrics, including classification, accuracy, recall, and F1 score, indicate the models strong ability to accurately identify abnormalities in endoscopic frames, showing promise for practical use in clinical diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijian Luo, Colin Zhang, Debing Zhang, Zhengyang Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct* (DI*), an image data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to train a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step text-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024 with only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference time and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly in PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1 on Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models. Besides the strong quantitative performances, extensive qualitative comparisons also confirm the advantages of DI* in terms of maintaining diversity, improving image layouts, and enhancing aesthetic colors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kezheng Xiong, Haoen Xiang, Qingshan Xu, Chenglu Wen, Siqi Shen, Jonathan Li, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration, a fundamental task in 3D vision, has achieved remarkable success with learning-based methods in outdoor environments. Unsupervised outdoor point cloud registration methods have recently emerged to circumvent the need for costly pose annotations. However, they fail to establish reliable optimization objectives for unsupervised training, either relying on overly strong geometric assumptions, or suffering from poor-quality pseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and high-level contextual information. We have observed that in the feature space, latent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive anchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER to incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label mining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module to dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training and discover reliable pseudo-labels by considering both high-level feature representations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with anchors for a robust feature space. Lastly, we introduce a Mixed-Density Student to learn density-invariant features, addressing challenges related to density variation and low overlap in the outdoor scenario. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our INTEGER achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuka Ogino, Yuho Shoji, Takahiro Toizumi, Atsushi Ito</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an image-adaptive object detection method for adverse weather conditions such as fog and low-light. Our framework employs differentiable preprocessing filters to perform image enhancement suitable for later-stage object detections. Our framework introduces two differentiable filters: a B\'ezier curve-based pixel-wise (BPW) filter and a kernel-based local (KBL) filter. These filters unify the functions of classical image processing filters and improve performance of object detection. We also propose a domain-agnostic data augmentation strategy using the BPW filter. Our method does not require data-specific customization of the filter combinations, parameter ranges, and data augmentation. We evaluate our proposed approach, called Enhanced Robustness by Unified Image Processing (ERUP)-YOLO, by applying it to the YOLOv3 detector. Experiments on adverse weather datasets demonstrate that our proposed filters match or exceed the expressiveness of conventional methods and our ERUP-YOLO achieved superior performance in a wide range of adverse weather conditions, including fog and low-light conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabien Poirier</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly effective in solving complex problems but are often viewed as "black boxes," limiting their adoption in contexts where transparency and explainability are essential. This lack of visibility raises ethical and legal concerns, particularly in critical areas like security, where automated decisions can have significant consequences. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) underscores the importance of justifying these decisions. In this work, we explore visualization techniques to improve the understanding of anomaly detection models based on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CNN + RNN) with a TimeDistributed layer. Our model combines VGG19 for convolutional feature extraction and a GRU layer for sequential analysis of real-time video data. While suitable for temporal data, this structure complicates gradient propagation, as sequence elements are processed independently, dissociating temporal information. We adapt visualization techniques such as saliency maps and Grad-CAM to address these challenges. This article highlights the difficulties in visually interpreting video-based models and demonstrates how techniques for static images can be adapted to recurrent architectures, offering a transitional solution in the absence of dedicated methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Edge detection has been one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision because of the difficulty in identifying the borders and edges from the real-world images including objects of varying kinds and sizes. Methods based on ensemble learning, which use a combination of backbones and attention modules, outperformed more conventional approaches, such as Sobel and Canny edge detection. Nevertheless, these algorithms are still challenged when faced with complicated scene photos. In addition, the identified edges utilizing the current methods are not refined and often include incorrect edges. In this work, we used a Cascaded Ensemble Canny operator to solve these problems and detect the object edges. The most difficult Fresh and Rotten and Berkeley datasets are used to test the suggested approach in Python. In terms of performance metrics and output picture quality, the acquired results outperform the specified edge detection networks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Zhiyu Tan, Junyan Wang, Xiaomeng Yang, Cheng Jin, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models have shown impressive capabilities. However, these models are still inadequate in aligning synthesized videos with human preferences (e.g., accurately reflecting text descriptions), which is particularly difficult to address, as human preferences are inherently subjective and challenging to formalize as objective functions. Therefore, this paper proposes LiFT, a novel fine-tuning method leveraging human feedback for T2V model alignment. Specifically, we first construct a Human Rating Annotation dataset, LiFT-HRA, consisting of approximately 10k human annotations, each including a score and its corresponding rationale. Based on this, we train a reward model LiFT-Critic to learn reward function effectively, which serves as a proxy for human judgment, measuring the alignment between given videos and human expectations. Lastly, we leverage the learned reward function to align the T2V model by maximizing the reward-weighted likelihood. As a case study, we apply our pipeline to CogVideoX-2B, showing that the fine-tuned model outperforms the CogVideoX-5B across all 16 metrics, highlighting the potential of human feedback in improving the alignment and quality of synthesized videos.</p>

<p>Abstract: Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer. Tracking the evolution of nevi and detecting new lesions across the body is essential for the early detection of melanoma. Despite prior work on longitudinal tracking of skin lesions in 3D total body photography, there are still several challenges, including 1) low accuracy for finding correct lesion pairs across scans, 2) sensitivity to noisy lesion detection, and 3) lack of large-scale datasets with numerous annotated lesion pairs. We propose a framework that takes in a pair of 3D textured meshes, matches lesions in the context of total body photography, and identifies unmatchable lesions. We start by computing correspondence maps bringing the source and target meshes to a template mesh. Using these maps to define source/target signals over the template domain, we construct a flow field aligning the mapped signals. The initial correspondence maps are then refined by advecting forward/backward along the vector field. Finally, lesion assignment is performed using the refined correspondence maps. We propose the first large-scale dataset for skin lesion tracking with 25K lesion pairs across 198 subjects. The proposed method achieves a success rate of 89.9% (at 10 mm criterion) for all pairs of annotated lesions and a matching accuracy of 98.2% for subjects with more than 200 lesions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifan Zhang, Lihuo He, Xin Jiang, Wen Lu, Di Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning has intensified the need for comprehensive data for use by autonomous driving algorithms. High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Chen, Shuai Zheng, Nianyi Wang, Menglong Jin, Yan Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating fuel sloshing within aircraft tanks during flight is crucial for aircraft safety research. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for simulating fuel sloshing in aircraft. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. Additionally, we constructed the Fueltank dataset, the first dataset for aircraft fuel surface sloshing. It comprises 320,000 frames across four typical tank types and covers a wide range of flight maneuvers, including multi-directional rotations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on both our dataset and the take-off scenario of the aircraft. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan-Sheng Zeng, Yunheng Li, Daquan Zhou, Guanbin Li, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary image segmentation has been advanced through the synergy between mask generators and vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Previous approaches focus on generating masks while aligning mask features with text embeddings during training. In this paper, we observe that relying on generated low-quality masks can weaken the alignment of vision and language in regional representations. This motivates us to present a new fine-tuning framework, named MaskCLIP++, which uses ground-truth masks instead of generated masks to enhance the mask classification capability of CLIP. Due to the limited diversity of image segmentation datasets with mask annotations, we propose incorporating a consistency alignment constraint during fine-tuning, which alleviates categorical bias toward the fine-tuning dataset. After low-cost fine-tuning, combining with the mask generator in previous state-of-the-art mask-based open vocabulary segmentation methods, we achieve performance improvements of +1.7, +2.3, +2.1, +3.1, and +0.3 mIoU on the A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, and PAS-20 datasets, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengbo Guo, Chengxu Liu, Xingsong Hou, Xueming Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Fisheye image rectification aims to correct distortions in images taken with fisheye cameras. Although current models show promising results on images with a similar degree of distortion as the training data, they will produce sub-optimal results when the degree of distortion changes and without retraining. The lack of generalization ability for dealing with varying degrees of distortion limits their practical application. In this paper, we take one step further to enable effective distortion rectification for images with varying degrees of distortion without retraining. We propose a novel Query-Based Controllable Distortion Rectification network for fisheye images (QueryCDR). In particular, we first present the Distortion-aware Learnable Query Mechanism (DLQM), which defines the latent spatial relationships for different distortion degrees as a series of learnable queries. Each query can be learned to obtain position-dependent rectification control conditions, providing control over the rectification process. Then, we propose two kinds of controllable modulating blocks to enable the control conditions to guide the modulation of the distortion features better. These core components cooperate with each other to effectively boost the generalization ability of the model at varying degrees of distortion. Extensive experiments on fisheye image datasets with different distortion degrees demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality and controllable distortion rectification.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541">Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyao Wang, Yuxuan Yang, Wenwen Qiang, Changwen Zheng, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saehyung Lee, Seunghyun Yoon, Trung Bui, Jing Shi, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at generating highly detailed captions but often produce hallucinations. Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Shape Tokens, a 3D representation that is continuous, compact, and easy to incorporate into machine learning models. Shape Tokens act as conditioning vectors that represent shape information in a 3D flow-matching model. The flow-matching model is trained to approximate probability density functions corresponding to delta functions concentrated on the surfaces of shapes in 3D. By attaching Shape Tokens to various machine learning models, we can generate new shapes, convert images to 3D, align 3D shapes with text and images, and render shapes directly at variable, user specified, resolution. Moreover, Shape Tokens enable a systematic analysis of geometric properties such as normal, density, and deformation field. Across all tasks and experiments, utilizing Shape Tokens demonstrate strong performance compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoyan Pan, Yikang Liu, Lin Zhao, Eric Z. Chen, Xiao Chen, Terrence Chen, Shanhui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate segmentation of guidewires in interventional cardiac fluoroscopy videos is crucial for computer-aided navigation tasks. Although deep learning methods have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in wire segmentation, they require substantial annotated datasets for generalizability, underscoring the need for extensive labeled data to enhance model performance. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation-guided Frame-consistency Video Diffusion Model (SF-VD) to generate large collections of labeled fluoroscopy videos, augmenting the training data for wire segmentation networks. SF-VD leverages videos with limited annotations by independently modeling scene distribution and motion distribution. It first samples the scene distribution by generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a specified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively generating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a frame-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the process by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in the synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the superior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in guidewire segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahe Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks on image classification systems have always been an important problem in the field of machine learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs), as popular models in the field of image generation, have been widely used in various novel scenarios due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, with the popularity of generative adversarial networks, the misuse of fake image technology has raised a series of security problems, such as malicious tampering with other people's photos and videos, and invasion of personal privacy. Inspired by the generative adversarial networks, this work proposes a novel adversarial attack method, aiming to gain insight into the weaknesses of the image classification system and improve its anti-attack ability. Specifically, the generative adversarial networks are used to generate adversarial samples with small perturbations but enough to affect the decision-making of the classifier, and the adversarial samples are generated through the adversarial learning of the training generator and the classifier. From extensive experiment analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of the method on a classical image classification dataset, and the results show that our model successfully deceives a variety of advanced classifiers while maintaining the naturalness of adversarial samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjian Chen, Fei Lv, Yalong Guan, Pengcheng Wang, Shengjie Yu, Yifan Zhang, Zhuo Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications (e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective way to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process is uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and some of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image generation method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a multi-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the exploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the exploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better performance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice users, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier. With this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which samples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal projection method, improved model performance in the case study for both classification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the experts.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16956">Semantic Hierarchical Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowei Zhu, Fangyuan Zhang, Rui Qin, Tianxiang Pan, Junhai Yong, Bin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As the scale of vision models continues to grow, Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient transfer learning technique, noted for its superior performance compared to full fine-tuning. However, indiscriminately applying prompts to every layer without considering their inherent correlations, can cause significant disturbances, leading to suboptimal transferability. Additionally, VPT disrupts the original self-attention structure, affecting the aggregation of visual features, and lacks a mechanism for explicitly mining discriminative visual features, which are crucial for classification. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Hierarchical Prompt (SHIP) fine-tuning strategy. We adaptively construct semantic hierarchies and use semantic-independent and semantic-shared prompts to learn hierarchical representations. We also integrate attribute prompts and a prompt matching loss to enhance feature discrimination and employ decoupled attention for robustness and reduced inference costs. SHIP significantly improves performance, achieving a 4.9% gain in accuracy over VPT with a ViT-B/16 backbone on VTAB-1k tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/haoweiz23/SHIP.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17038">ErasableMask: A Robust and Erasable Privacy Protection Scheme against Black-box Face Recognition Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sipeng Shen, Yunming Zhang, Dengpan Ye, Xiuwen Shi, Long Tang, Haoran Duan, Jiacheng Deng, Ziyi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While face recognition (FR) models have brought remarkable convenience in face verification and identification, they also pose substantial privacy risks to the public. Existing facial privacy protection schemes usually adopt adversarial examples to disrupt face verification of FR models. However, these schemes often suffer from weak transferability against black-box FR models and permanently damage the identifiable information that cannot fulfill the requirements of authorized operations such as forensics and authentication. To address these limitations, we propose ErasableMask, a robust and erasable privacy protection scheme against black-box FR models. Specifically, via rethinking the inherent relationship between surrogate FR models, ErasableMask introduces a novel meta-auxiliary attack, which boosts black-box transferability by learning more general features in a stable and balancing optimization strategy. It also offers a perturbation erasion mechanism that supports the erasion of semantic perturbations in protected face without degrading image quality. To further improve performance, ErasableMask employs a curriculum learning strategy to mitigate optimization conflicts between adversarial attack and perturbation erasion. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that ErasableMask achieves the state-of-the-art performance in transferability, achieving over 72% confidence on average in commercial FR systems. Moreover, ErasableMask also exhibits outstanding perturbation erasion performance, achieving over 90% erasion success rate.</p>

The process begins by identifying the region of interest (ROI) in the battery's X-ray image through corner point detection. A convolutional neural network is then used to regress the pole positions within this ROI. Finally, the regressed positions are optimized and corrected using corner point priors, significantly mitigating the loss of localization accuracy caused by operations such as feature map down-sampling and padding during network training. Our findings show that combining traditional pixel gradient analysis with CNN-based heatmap regression for keypoint extraction enhances both accuracy and efficiency, resulting in significant performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enshu Liu, Xuefei Ning, Yu Wang, Zinan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text and image generation but suffer from slow generation due to the token-by-token process. We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

<p>Abstract: Early detection of cancer is critical in improving treatment outcomes and increasing survival rates, particularly for common cancers such as lung, breast, and prostate which collectively contribute to a significant global mortality burden. With advancements in imaging technologies and data processing, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and classifying medical images, enabling more precise cancer detection. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent studies leveraging CNN models for detecting ten different types of cancer. Each study employs distinct CNN architectures to identify patterns associated with these cancers, utilizing diverse datasets. Key differences and strengths of these architectures are meticulously compared and analyzed, highlighting their efficacy in improving early detection. Beyond reviewing the performance and limitations of CNN-based cancer detection methods, this study explores the feasibility of integrating CNNs into clinical settings as an early detection tool, potentially complementing or replacing traditional methods. Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including data diversity, result interpretation, and ethical considerations. By identifying the best-performing CNN architectures and providing a comparative analysis, this study aims to contribute a comprehensive perspective on the application of CNNs in cancer detection and their role in advancing diagnostic capabilities in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation has attracted considerable attention for its ability to mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled data. However, existing consistency regularization methods only utilize high certain pixels with prediction confidence surpassing a fixed threshold for training, failing to fully leverage the potential supervisory information within the network. Therefore, this paper proposes the Uncertainty-participation Context Consistency Learning (UCCL) method to explore richer supervisory signals. Specifically, we first design the semantic backpropagation update (SBU) strategy to fully exploit the knowledge from uncertain pixel regions, enabling the model to learn consistent pixel-level semantic information from those areas. Furthermore, we propose the class-aware knowledge regulation (CKR) module to facilitate the regulation of class-level semantic features across different augmented views, promoting consistent learning of class-level semantic information within the encoder. Experimental results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/YUKEKEJAN/UCCL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjin Kim, Jaejun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: While pruning methods effectively maintain model performance without extra training costs, they often focus solely on preserving crucial connections, overlooking the impact of pruned weights on subsequent fine-tuning or distillation, leading to inefficiencies. Moreover, most compression techniques for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3 and DDPM demonstrate that SVS improves compression performance across model types without additional training costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Fang, Junkai Fan, Yu Zheng, Jiangwei Weng, Ying Tai, Jun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Image dehazing, particularly with learning-based methods, has gained significant attention due to its importance in real-world applications. However, relying solely on the RGB color space often fall short, frequently leaving residual haze. This arises from two main issues: the difficulty in obtaining clear textural features from hazy RGB images and the complexity of acquiring real haze/clean image pairs outside controlled environments like smoke-filled scenes. To address these issues, we first propose a novel Structure Guided Dehazing Network (SGDN) that leverages the superior structural properties of YCbCr features over RGB. It comprises two key modules: Bi-Color Guidance Bridge (BGB) and Color Enhancement Module (CEM). BGB integrates a phase integration module and an interactive attention module, utilizing the rich texture features of the YCbCr space to guide the RGB space, thereby recovering clearer features in both frequency and spatial domains. To maintain tonal consistency, CEM further enhances the color perception of RGB features by aggregating YCbCr channel information. Furthermore, for effective supervised learning, we introduce a Real-World Well-Aligned Haze (RW$^2$AH) dataset, which includes a diverse range of scenes from various geographical regions and climate conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world smoke/haze datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Liang, Jun Luo, Xiaoxi Guo, Jianqi Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: In product advertising applications, the automated inpainting of backgrounds utilizing AI techniques in product images has emerged as a significant task. However, the techniques still suffer from issues such as inappropriate background and inconsistent product in generated product images, and existing approaches for evaluating the quality of generated product images are mostly inconsistent with human feedback causing the evaluation for this task to depend on manual annotation. To relieve the issues above, this paper proposes Human Feedback and Product Consistency (HFPC), which can automatically assess the generated product images based on two modules. Firstly, to solve inappropriate backgrounds, human feedback on 44,000 automated inpainting product images is collected to train a reward model based on multi-modal features extracted from BLIP and comparative learning. Secondly, to filter generated product images containing inconsistent products, a fine-tuned segmentation model is employed to segment the product of the original and generated product images and then compare the differences between the above two. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that HFPC can effectively evaluate the quality of generated product images and significantly reduce the expense of manual annotation. Moreover, HFPC achieves state-of-the-art(96.4% in precision) in comparison to other open-source visual-quality-assessment models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Roy Qin, Zhengyu Zou, Diqi He, Bohan Li, Bingquan Dai, Dingewn Zhang, Junwei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Applying Gaussian Splatting to perception tasks for 3D scene understanding is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing works primarily focus on rendering 2D feature maps from novel viewpoints, which leads to an imprecise 3D language field with outlier languages, ultimately failing to align objects in 3D space. By utilizing masked images for feature extraction, these approaches also lack essential contextual information, leading to inaccurate feature representation. To this end, we propose a Language-Embedded Surface Field (LangSurf), which accurately aligns the 3D language fields with the surface of objects, facilitating precise 2D and 3D segmentation with text query, widely expanding the downstream tasks such as removal and editing. The core of LangSurf is a joint training strategy that flattens the language Gaussian on the object surfaces using geometry supervision and contrastive losses to assign accurate language features to the Gaussians of objects. In addition, we also introduce the Hierarchical-Context Awareness Module to extract features at the image level for contextual information then perform hierarchical mask pooling using masks segmented by SAM to obtain fine-grained language features in different hierarchies. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 2D and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSurf outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LangSplat by a large margin. As shown in Fig. 1, our method is capable of segmenting objects in 3D space, thus boosting the effectiveness of our approach in instance recognition, removal, and editing, which is also supported by comprehensive experiments. \url{https://langsurf.github.io}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Chen, Jianfeng Zhang, Yixun Liang, Guan Luo, Weiyu Li, Jiarui Liu, Xiu Li, Xiaoxiao Long, Jiashi Feng, Ping Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent 3D content generation pipelines commonly employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode shapes into compact latent representations for diffusion-based generation. However, the widely adopted uniform point sampling strategy in Shape VAE training often leads to a significant loss of geometric details, limiting the quality of shape reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. We present Dora-VAE, a novel approach that enhances VAE reconstruction through our proposed sharp edge sampling strategy and a dual cross-attention mechanism. By identifying and prioritizing regions with high geometric complexity during training, our method significantly improves the preservation of fine-grained shape features. Such sampling strategy and the dual attention mechanism enable the VAE to focus on crucial geometric details that are typically missed by uniform sampling approaches. To systematically evaluate VAE reconstruction quality, we additionally propose Dora-bench, a benchmark that quantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a new metric focused on reconstruction accuracy at these salient geometric features. Extensive experiments on the Dora-bench demonstrate that Dora-VAE achieves comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art dense XCube-VAE while requiring a latent space at least 8$\times$ smaller (1,280 vs. > 10,000 codes). We will release our code and benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in 3D shape modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyu Sun, Umar Khalid, Matias Mendieta, Pu Wang, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling the collaborative training of models without centralized access to the raw data on local devices. In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown to be effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters, known as the "Foundation Models." In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tina Dorosti, Manuel Schultheiss, Felix Hofmann, Johannes Thalhammer, Luisa Kirchner, Theresa Urban, Franz Pfeiffer, Florian Schaff, Tobias Lasser, Daniela Pfeiffer</p>
<p>Abstract: We aim to optimize the binary detection of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) based on emphysema presence in the lung with convolutional neural networks (CNN) by exploring manually adjusted versus automated window-setting optimization (WSO) on computed tomography (CT) images. 7,194 CT images (3,597 with COPD; 3,597 healthy controls) from 78 subjects were selected retrospectively (10.2018-12.2021) and preprocessed. For each image, intensity values were manually clipped to the emphysema window setting and a baseline 'full-range' window setting. Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets contained 3,392, 1,114, and 2,688 images. The network backbone was optimized by comparing various CNN architectures. Furthermore, automated WSO was implemented by adding a customized layer to the model. The image-level area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) [lower, upper limit 95% confidence] was utilized to compare model variations. Repeated inference (n=7) on the test set showed that the DenseNet was the most efficient backbone and achieved a mean AUC of 0.80 [0.76, 0.85] without WSO. Comparably, with input images manually adjusted to the emphysema window, the DenseNet model predicted COPD with a mean AUC of 0.86 [0.82, 0.89]. By adding a customized WSO layer to the DenseNet, an optimal window in the proximity of the emphysema window setting was learned automatically, and a mean AUC of 0.82 [0.78, 0.86] was achieved. Detection of COPD with DenseNet models was improved by WSO of CT data to the emphysema window setting range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Sclocchi, Alessandro Favero, Matthieu Wyart</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the structure of real data is paramount in advancing modern deep-learning methodologies. Natural data such as images are believed to be composed of features organized in a hierarchical and combinatorial manner, which neural networks capture during learning. Recent advancements show that diffusion models can generate high-quality images, hinting at their ability to capture this underlying compositional structure. We study this phenomenon in a hierarchical generative model of data. We find that the backward diffusion process acting after a time $t$ is governed by a phase transition at some threshold time, where the probability of reconstructing high-level features, like the class of an image, suddenly drops. Instead, the reconstruction of low-level features, such as specific details of an image, evolves smoothly across the whole diffusion process. This result implies that at times beyond the transition, the class has changed, but the generated sample may still be composed of low-level elements of the initial image. We validate these theoretical insights through numerical experiments on class-unconditional ImageNet diffusion models. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between time and scale in diffusion models and puts forward generative models as powerful tools to model combinatorial data properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibao Yu, Wenxian Yang, Jiaru Zhong, Zhenwei Yang, Siqi Fan, Ping Luo, Zaiqing Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperatively utilizing both ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensor data via V2X communication has emerged as a promising approach for advanced autonomous driving. However, current research mainly focuses on improving individual modules, rather than taking end-to-end learning to optimize final planning performance, resulting in underutilized data potential. In this paper, we introduce UniV2X, a pioneering cooperative autonomous driving framework that seamlessly integrates all key driving modules across diverse views into a unified network. We propose a sparse-dense hybrid data transmission and fusion mechanism for effective vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, offering three advantages: 1) Effective for simultaneously enhancing agent perception, online mapping, and occupancy prediction, ultimately improving planning performance. 2) Transmission-friendly for practical and limited communication conditions. 3) Reliable data fusion with interpretability of this hybrid data. We implement UniV2X, as well as reproducing several benchmark methods, on the challenging DAIR-V2X, the real-world cooperative driving dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniV2X in significantly enhancing planning performance, as well as all intermediate output performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yacine Izza, Xuanxiang Huang, Antonio Morgado, Jordi Planes, Alexey Ignatiev, Joao Marques-Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: The uses of machine learning (ML) have snowballed in recent years. In many cases, ML models are highly complex, and their operation is beyond the understanding of human decision-makers. Nevertheless, some uses of ML models involve high-stakes and safety-critical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help human decision-makers in understanding the operation of such complex ML models, thus eliciting trust in their operation. Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romy Williamson, Niloy J. Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups. Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry. In the absence of an analogous toolbox, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation. Namely, we estimate surface normals and first and second fundamental forms of the surface, as well as compute surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace-Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface. Our representation is fully seamless, overcoming a key limitation of similar explicit representations such as Neural Surface Maps [Morreale et al. 2021]. These operators, in turn, enable geometry processing directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and evaluate robustness to isometric shape variations. We propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates, against analytical estimates, mesh-based baselines, and neural alternatives, where available. By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe that this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing. Code will be released upon acceptance, accessible from the project webpage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhavna Gopal, Huanrui Yang, Jingyang Zhang, Mark Horton, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training enhances neural network robustness but suffers from a tendency to overfit and increased generalization errors on clean data. This work introduces CLAT, an innovative approach that mitigates adversarial overfitting by introducing parameter efficiency into the adversarial training process, improving both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. Instead of tuning the entire model, CLAT identifies and fine-tunes robustness-critical layers - those predominantly learning non-robust features - while freezing the remaining model to enhance robustness. It employs dynamic critical layer selection to adapt to changes in layer criticality throughout the fine-tuning process. Empirically, CLAT can be applied on top of existing adversarial training methods, significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 95%, and achieves more than a 2% improvement in adversarial robustness compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Garske, Bradley Evans, Christopher Artlett, KC Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting unexpected objects (anomalies) in real time has great potential for monitoring, managing, and protecting the environment. Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection over RGB and multispectral imagery. However, existing line-scan algorithms are too slow when using small computers (e.g. those onboard a drone or small satellite), do not adapt to changing scenery, or lack robustness against geometric distortions. This paper introduces the Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) to address these issues, and compares it with four existing RX-based anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral line scanning. Three large and more complex datasets are also introduced to better assess the practical challenges when using line-scan cameras (two hyperspectral and one multispectral). ERX was evaluated using a Jetson Xavier NX edge computing module (6-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 20W power draw), achieving the best combination of speed and detection performance. ERX was 9 times faster than the next-best algorithm on the dataset with the highest number of bands (108 band), with an average speed of 561 lines per second on the Jetson. It achieved a 29.3% AUC improvement over the next-best algorithm on the most challenging dataset, while showing greater adaptability through consistently high AUC scores regardless of the camera's starting location. ERX performed robustly across all datasets, achieving an AUC of 0.941 on a drone-collected hyperspectral line scan dataset without geometric corrections (a 16.9% improvement over existing algorithms). This work enables future research on the detection of anomalous objects in real time, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and real-time field tests.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bangya Liu, Suman Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Akin Yilmaz, Onur Kele\c{s}, A. Murat Tekalp</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate how the prevalent practice in the learned video compression community of averaging rate-distortion (RD) curves across a test video set can lead to misleading conclusions in evaluating codec performance. Through analytical analysis of a simple case and experimental results with two recent learned video codecs, we show how averaged RD curves can mislead comparative evaluation of different codecs, particularly when videos in a dataset have varying characteristics and operating ranges. We illustrate how a single video with distinct RD characteristics from the rest of the test set can disproportionately influence the average RD curve, potentially overshadowing a codec's superior performance across most individual sequences. Using two recent learned video codecs on the UVG dataset as a case study, we demonstrate computing performance metrics, such as the BD rate, from the average RD curve suggests conclusions that contradict those reached from calculating the average of per-sequence metrics. Hence, we argue that the learned video compression community should also report per-sequence RD curves and performance metrics for a test set should be computed from the average of per-sequence metrics, similar to the established practice in traditional video coding, to ensure fair and accurate codec comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen He, Chuyun Shen, Xiangfeng Wang, Bo Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) aims to learn from sequential data stream in the decentralized federated learning setting, while simultaneously mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue in classical continual learning. Existing FCL methods usually employ typical rehearsal mechanisms, which could result in privacy violations or additional onerous storage and computational burdens. In this work, an efficient and non-IID robust federated continual learning framework, called Federated Prototype-Augmented Prompt Learning (FPPL), is proposed. The FPPL can collaboratively learn lightweight prompts augmented by prototypes without rehearsal. On the client side, a fusion function is employed to fully leverage the knowledge contained in task-specific prompts for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, global prototypes aggregated from the server are used to obtain unified representation through contrastive learning, mitigating the impact of non-IID-derived data heterogeneity. On the server side, locally uploaded prototypes are utilized to perform debiasing on the classifier, further alleviating the performance degradation caused by both non-IID and catastrophic forgetting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FPPL, achieving notable performance with an efficient design while remaining robust to diverse non-IID degrees.

<p>Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghang Li, Peiyan Li, Minghuan Liu, Dong Wang, Jirong Liu, Bingyi Kang, Xiao Ma, Tao Kong, Hanbo Zhang, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in multi-modal representation learning, comprehension, and reasoning. By injecting action components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be naturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios and tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since existing VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data distributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a systematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research. We open-source all details, including codes, models, datasets, and toolkits, along with detailed training and evaluation recipes at: robovlms.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: The interference of overlapping bones and pulmonary structures can reduce the effectiveness of Chest X-ray (CXR) examinations. Bone suppression techniques have been developed to improve diagnostic accuracy. Dual-energy subtraction (DES) imaging, a common method for bone suppression, is costly and exposes patients to higher radiation levels. Deep learning-based image generation methods have been proposed as alternatives, however, they often fail to produce high-quality and high-resolution images, resulting in the loss of critical lesion information and texture details. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework for bone suppression in high-resolution CXR images, termed BS-LDM. This framework employs a conditional latent diffusion model to generate high-resolution soft tissue images with fine detail and critical lung pathology by performing bone suppression in the latent space. We implement offset noise during the noise addition phase of the training process to better render low-frequency information in soft tissue images. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic clipping strategy during the sampling process to refine pixel intensity in the generated soft tissue images. We compiled a substantial and high-quality bone suppression dataset, SZCH-X-Rays, including high-resolution paired CXR and DES soft tissue images from 818 patients, collected from our partner hospitals. Moreover, we pre-processed 241 pairs of CXR and DES soft tissue images from the JSRT dataset, the largest publicly available dataset. Comprehensive experimental and clinical evaluations demonstrate that BS-LDM exhibits superior bone suppression capabilities, highlighting its significant clinical potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daichi Yashima, Ryosuke Korekata, Komei Sugiura</p>
<p>Abstract: Growing labor shortages are increasing the demand for domestic service robots (DSRs) to assist in various settings. In this study, we develop a DSR that transports everyday objects to specified pieces of furniture based on open-vocabulary instructions. Our approach focuses on retrieving images of target objects and receptacles from pre-collected images of indoor environments. For example, given an instruction "Please get the right red towel hanging on the metal towel rack and put it in the white washing machine on the left," the DSR is expected to carry the red towel to the washing machine based on the retrieved images. This is challenging because the correct images should be retrieved from thousands of collected images, which may include many images of similar towels and appliances. To address this, we propose RelaX-Former, which learns diverse and robust representations from among positive, unlabeled positive, and negative samples. We evaluated RelaX-Former on a dataset containing real-world indoor images and human annotated instructions including complex referring expressions. The experimental results demonstrate that RelaX-Former outperformed existing baseline models across standard image retrieval metrics. Moreover, we performed physical experiments using a DSR to evaluate the performance of our approach in a zero-shot transfer setting. The experiments involved the DSR to carry objects to specific receptacles based on open-vocabulary instructions, achieving an overall success rate of 75%.</p>
