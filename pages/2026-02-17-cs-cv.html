<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyu Mu, Jianshi Wu, Yuxin Guo, XianLian Lin, Qingyong Hu, Chenglu Wen, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Localization is a fundamental capability in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals. However, existing LiDAR relocalization methods are primarily tailored to autonomous driving, exhibiting significantly degraded accuracy in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathanya Satriani, Djordje Slijep\v{c}evi\'c, Markus Schedl, Matthias Zeppelzauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Explanatory interactive learning (XIL) enables users to guide model training in machine learning (ML) by providing feedback on the model's explanations, thereby helping it to focus on features that are relevant to the prediction from the user's perspective. In this study, we explore the capability of this learning paradigm to mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers, specifically in scenarios prone to data bias, such as gender classification. We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13287">COOPERTRIM: Adaptive Data Selection for Uncertainty-Aware Cooperative Perception</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shilpa Mukhopadhyay, Amit Roy-Chowdhury, Hang Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception enables autonomous agents to share encoded representations over wireless communication to enhance each other's live situational awareness. However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13289">Evaluating the Impact of Post-Training Quantization on Reliable VQA with Multimodal LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Jonas Kurz, Tobias Jan Wieczorek, Mohamed A. Abdelsalam, Rahaf Aljundi, Marcus Rohrbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) are increasingly deployed in domains where both reliability and efficiency are critical. However, current models remain overconfident, producing highly certain but incorrect answers. At the same time, their large size limits deployment on edge devices, necessitating compression. We study the intersection of these two challenges by analyzing how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) compression affects both accuracy and reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand. Overall, we present the first systematic study linking quantization and reliability in multimodal settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13293">NutVLM: A Self-Adaptive Defense Framework against Full-Dimension Attacks for Vision Language Models in Autonomous Driving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxu Peng, Dong Zhou, Jianwen Zhang, Guanghui Sun, Anh Tu Ngo, Anupam Chattopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have advanced perception in autonomous driving (AD), but they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates "corrective driving prompts" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at https://github.com/PXX/NutVLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarong Liang, Max Ku, Ka-Hei Hui, Ping Nie, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwyn Brient (CMM), Santiago Velasco-Forero (CMM), Rami Kassab</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution range profile (HRRP ) data are in vogue in radar automatic target recognition (RATR). With the interest in classifying models using HRRP, filling gaps in datasets using generative models has recently received promising contributions. Evaluating generated data is a challenging topic, even for explicit data like face images. However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise. Using this decomposition, we propose two metrics based on the physical interpretation of those data. We take profit from an expensive dataset to evaluate our metrics on a challenging task and demonstrate the discriminative ability of those.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwyn Brient (CMM), Santiago Velasco-Forero (CMM), Rami Kassab</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) enable fast onboard processing for radar automatic target recognition, but their strong sensitivity to acquisition conditions limits robustness across operational scenarios. Conditional HRRP generation can mitigate this issue, yet prior studies are constrained by small, highly specific datasets. We study HRRP synthesis on a largescale maritime database representative of coastal surveillance variability. Our analysis indicates that the fundamental scenario drivers are geometric: ship dimensions and the desired aspect angle. Conditioning on these variables, we train generative models and show that the synthesized signatures reproduce the expected line-of-sight geometric trend observed in real data. These results highlight the central role of acquisition geometry for robust HRRP generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manfred M. Fischer, Joshua Pitts</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing convolutional depth has been central to advances in image recognition, yet deeper networks do not uniformly yield higher accuracy, stable optimization, or efficient computation. We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13299">KidMesh: Computational Mesh Reconstruction for Pediatric Congenital Hydronephrosis Using Deep Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Sun, Zhanpeng Zhu, Anguo Zhang, Bo Liu, Zhaohua Lin, Liqin Huang, Mingjing Yang, Lei Liu, Shan Lin, Wangbin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Pediatric congenital hydronephrosis (CH) is a common urinary tract disorder, primarily caused by obstruction at the renal pelvis-ureter junction. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13301">DriveMamba: Task-Centric Scalable State Space Model for Efficient End-to-End Autonomous Driving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisheng Su, Wei Wu, Feixiang Song, Junjie Zhang, Zhenjie Yang, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances towards End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) have been often devoted on integrating modular designs into a unified framework for joint optimization e.g. UniAD, which follow a sequential paradigm (i.e., perception-prediction-planning) based on separable Transformer decoders and rely on dense BEV features to encode scene representations. However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided "local-to-global" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superiority, generalizability and great efficiency of DriveMamba.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13303">Spectral Collapse in Diffusion Inversion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Bourriez, Alexandre Verine, Auguste Genovesio</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional diffusion inversion provides a powerful framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality (NCC~$\leq 0.96$). We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency. On OR-PAM-Reg-4K (432 test samples), PCReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

<p>Abstract: Wildfires are a growing threat to ecosystems, human lives, and infrastructure, with their frequency and intensity rising due to climate change and human activities. Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehan Zhang, Meihua Qian, Li Luo, Siyu Huang, Chaoyi Zhou, Ripon Saha, Xinxin Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing artistic creativity is foundational to creativity research and arts education, yet manual scoring (e.g., Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) is labor-intensive at scale. Prior machine-learning approaches show promise for visual creativity scoring, but many rely mainly on image features and provide limited or no explanatory feedback. We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13310">Visual Para-Thinker: Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning for Visual Comprehension</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Xu, Hongyu Wang, Jiaze Li, Shunpeng Chen, Zizhao Tong, Jianzhong Ju, Zhenbo Luo, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing LLM test-time scaling laws emphasize the emergence of self-reflective behaviors through extended reasoning length. Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern. By shifting from depth to parallelism, parallel thinking mitigates the narrowing of exploration. However, the extension of this paradigm to visual domain remains an open research question. In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench confirm that Visual Para-Thinker successfully extends the benefits of parallel reasoning to the visual domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Zhao, Yew-Soon Ong, Joey Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to retrieve the spatio-temporal tube of a target object or person in a video given a text query. Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Bejerano, Federico Tondolo, Aayan Qayyum, Xiaofan Yu, Xiaofan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar provides reliable perception in visually degraded indoor environments (e.g., smoke, dust, and low light), but learning-based radar perception is bottlenecked by the scarcity and cost of collecting and annotating large-scale radar datasets. We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Tan, Yifu Sun, Shirui Huang, Hong Liu, Guanghua Yu, Jianchen Zhu, Yangdong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet they encounter significant computational bottlenecks due to the massive volume of visual tokens. Consequently, visual token pruning, which substantially reduces the token count, has emerged as a critical technique for accelerating MLLM inference. Existing approaches focus on token importance, diversity, or an intuitive combination of both, without a principled framework for their optimal integration. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic analysis to characterize the trade-off between token importance and semantic diversity. Guided by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{I}mportance and \textbf{D}iversity Pruner (\textbf{IDPruner}), which leverages the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between these two objectives. Crucially, our method operates without requiring attention maps, ensuring full compatibility with FlashAttention and efficient deployment via one-shot pruning. We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\% even under an extreme 90\% pruning ratio.

<p>Abstract: We present the PolyShapes-Ideal (PSI) dataset, a suite of diagnostic benchmarks designed to isolate topological invariance -- the ability to maintain structural identity across affine transformations -- from the textural correlations that dominate standard vision benchmarks. Through three diagnostic probes (polygon classification under noise, zero-shot font transfer from MNIST, and geometric collapse mapping under progressive deformation), we demonstrate that the Eidos architecture achieves >99% accuracy on PSI and 81.67% zero-shot transfer across 30 unseen typefaces without pre-training. These results validate the "Form-First" hypothesis: generalization in structurally constrained architectures is a property of geometric integrity, not statistical scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Barkley, Abraham George, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xirui Hu, Yanbo Ding, Jiahao Wang, Tingting Shi, Yali Wang, Guo Zhi Zhi, Weizhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Character image animation, which synthesizes videos of reference characters driven by pose sequences, has advanced rapidly but remains largely limited to single-human settings. Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiru Wang, Zichong Gu, Yu Gao, Anqing Jiang, Zhigang Sun, Shuo Wang, Yuwen Heng, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer promising capabilities for autonomous driving through multimodal understanding. However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation.
  Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with videos" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying Vision Transformers on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational complexity, while full offloading to cloud resources presents significant latency overheads. We propose a novel collaborative inference framework, which orchestrates a lightweight generalist ViT on an edge device and multiple medium-sized expert ViTs on a near-edge accelerator. A novel routing mechanism uses the edge model's Top-$\mathit{k}$ predictions to dynamically select the most relevant expert for samples with low confidence. We further design a progressive specialist training strategy to enhance expert accuracy on dataset subsets. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a real-world edge and near-edge testbed demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Specifically, the proposed training strategy improves expert specialization accuracy by 4.12% on target subsets and enhances overall accuracy by 2.76% over static experts. Moreover, our method reduces latency by up to 45% compared to edge execution, and energy consumption by up to 46% compared to just near-edge offload.</p>

<p>Abstract: The biological behavior and treatment response of meningiomas depend on their grade, making an accurate diagnosis essential for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. We observed that the weighted fusion of spatial-frequency domain features significantly influences meningioma classification performance. Notably, the contribution of specific frequency bands obtained by discrete wavelet transform varies considerably across different images. A feature fusion architecture with adaptive weights of different frequency band information and spatial domain information is proposed for few-shot meningioma learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a new MRI dataset of meningiomas is introduced. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing state-of-the-art methods in three datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lishan Sun, Yujia Cheng, Pengfei Cui, Lei Han, Mohamed Abdel-Aty, Yunhan Zheng, Xingchen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Macroscopic traffic safety modeling aims to identify critical risk factors for regional crashes, thereby informing targeted policy interventions for safety improvement. However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.</p>

We construct a 1.6B-sample training corpus, comprising 900M text-to-image and 700M image editing pairs from diverse sources. After rigorous cleaning, stratification, auto-labeling, and two-stage filtering, we retain over 100M high-quality samples balanced between generation and editing, ensuring strong semantic coverage and instruction alignment. Our multi-stage training pipeline progressively builds editing capability via pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. To improve data efficiency, we introduce a Multi-Condition Aware Bucket Sampler for variable-resolution batching and Stochastic Instruction Alignment with dynamic prompt re-indexing. To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation.

We propose FOREST, a stow-intent-conditioned world model that represents bin states as item-aligned instance masks and uses a latent diffusion transformer to predict the post-stow configuration from the observed context. Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models have made significant strides, producing impressive results in generating images from textual descriptions. However, creating a scalable pipeline for deploying these models in production remains a challenge. Achieving the right balance between automation and human feedback is critical to maintain both scale and quality. While automation can handle large volumes, human oversight is still an essential component to ensure that the generated images meet the desired standards and are aligned with the creative vision. This paper presents a new pipeline that offers a fully automated, scalable solution for generating marketing images of commercial products using text-to-image models. The proposed system maintains the quality and fidelity of images, while also introducing sufficient creative variation to adhere to marketing guidelines. By streamlining this process, we ensure a seamless blend of efficiency and human oversight, achieving a $30.77\%$ increase in marketing object fidelity using DINOV2 and a $52.00\%$ increase in human preference over the generated outcome.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated image captioning using the content from the image is very appealing when done by harnessing the capability of computer vision and natural language processing. Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process. An additional Attention layer helps to generate a weight vector and, by multiplying it, combine image characteristics from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector. Bilingual evaluation understudy scores are used to compare the research outcome. Many experiments that serve as a baseline are done for the comparative analysis of the research. An image with a score of BLEU-1 is considered sufficient, whereas one with a score of BLEU-4 is considered to have fluid image captioning. For both BLEU scores, the attention-based bidirectional LSTM with VGG16 produced the best results of 0.59 and 0.19 respectively. The experiments conclude that researchs ability to produce relevant, semantically accurate image captions in Hindi. The research accomplishes the goals and future research can be guided by this research model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity image and video generation but suffer from expensive inference due to their iterative denoising structure. While prior methods accelerate sampling by caching intermediate features, they rely on static reuse schedules or coarse-grained heuristics, which often lead to temporal drift and cache misalignment that significantly degrade generation quality. We introduce \textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration. Experiments on image and video diffusion benchmarks show that AdaCorrection consistently improves generation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Li, Wei Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind image separation (BIS) refers to the inverse problem of simultaneously estimating and restoring multiple independent source images from a single observation image under conditions of unknown mixing mode and without prior knowledge of the source images. Traditional methods relying on statistical independence assumptions or CNN/GAN variants struggle to characterize complex feature distributions in real scenes, leading to estimation bias, texture distortion, and artifact residue under strong noise and nonlinear mixing. This paper innovatively introduces diffusion models into dual-channel BIS, proposing an efficient Dual-Channel Diffusion Separation Model (DCDSM). DCDSM leverages diffusion models' powerful generative capability to learn source image feature distributions and reconstruct feature structures effectively. A novel Wavelet Suppression Module (WSM) is designed within the dual-branch reverse denoising process, forming an interactive separation network that enhances detail separation by exploiting the mutual coupling noise characteristic between source images. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets containing rain/snow and complex mixtures demonstrate that DCDSM achieves state-of-the-art performance: 1) In image restoration tasks, it obtains PSNR/SSIM values of 35.0023 dB/0.9549 and 29.8108 dB/0.9243 for rain and snow removal respectively, outperforming Histoformer and LDRCNet by 1.2570 dB/0.9272 dB (PSNR) and 0.0262/0.0289 (SSIM) on average; 2) For complex mixture separation, the restored dual-source images achieve average PSNR and SSIM of 25.0049 dB and 0.7997, surpassing comparative methods by 4.1249 dB and 0.0926. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm DCDSM's superiority in addressing rain/snow residue removal and detail preservation challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giang Son Nguyen, Zi Pong Lim, Sarthak Ketanbhai Modi, Yon Shin Teo, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in document processing pipelines to convert flowchart images into structured code (e.g., Mermaid). In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohail Ali Farooqui, Zuhair Ahmed Khan Taha, Mohammed Mudassir Uddin, Shahnawaz Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles serve as primary sensing platforms for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster response, making aerial object detection a central problem in applied computer vision. Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\pm$0.3\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\pm$0.4\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ha-Hieu Pham, Hai-Dang Nguyen, Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Min Xu, Ulas Bagci, Trung-Nghia Le, Huy-Hieu Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) classification in clinical practice is often limited by imperfect supervision, arising from (i) extreme long-tailed multi-label disease distributions and (ii) missing annotations for rare or previously unseen findings. The CXR-LT 2026 challenge addresses these issues on a PadChest-based benchmark with a 36-class label space split into 30 in-distribution classes for training and 6 out-of-distribution (OOD) classes for zero-shot evaluation. We present task-specific solutions tailored to the distinct supervision regimes. For Task 1 (long-tailed multi-label classification), we adopt an imbalance-aware multi-label learning strategy to improve recognition of tail classes while maintaining stable performance on frequent findings. For Task 2 (zero-shot OOD recognition), we propose a prediction approach that produces scores for unseen disease categories without using any supervised labels or examples from the OOD classes during training. Evaluated with macro-averaged mean Average Precision (mAP), our method achieves strong performance on both tasks, ranking first on the public leaderboard of the development phase.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian-Ion Nae, Mihai-Eugen Barbu, Sebastian Mocanu, Marius Leordeanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents such as indoor drones must learn new object classes in real-time while limiting catastrophic forgetting, motivating Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). However, most unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets focus on outdoor scenes and offer limited temporally coherent indoor videos. We introduce an indoor dataset of $14,400$ frames capturing inter-drone and ground vehicle footage, annotated via a semi-automatic workflow with a $98.6\%$ first-pass labeling agreement before final manual verification. Using this dataset, we benchmark 3 replay-based CIL strategies: Experience Replay (ER), Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR), and Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR), using YOLOv11-nano as a resource-efficient detector for deployment-constrained UAV platforms. Under tight memory budgets ($5-10\%$ replay), FAR performs better than the rest, achieving an average accuracy (ACC, $mAP_{50-95}$ across increments) of $82.96\%$ with $5\%$ replay. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis shows attention shifts across classes in mixed scenes, which is associated with reduced localization quality for drones. The experiments further demonstrate that replay-based continual learning can be effectively applied to edge aerial systems. Overall, this work contributes an indoor UAV video dataset with preserved temporal coherence and an evaluation of replay-based CIL under limited replay budgets.

<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in understanding and reasoning about visual content, particularly in tasks involving text recognition and text-based visual question answering (Text VQA). However, deploying Text VQA on wearable devices faces a fundamental tension: text recognition requires high-resolution video, but streaming high-quality video drains battery and causes thermal throttling. Moreover, existing models struggle to maintain coherent temporal context when processing text across multiple frames in real-time streams. We observe that text recognition and visual reasoning have asymmetric resolution requirements - OCR needs fine detail while scene understanding tolerates coarse features. We exploit this asymmetry with a hybrid architecture that performs selective high-resolution OCR on-device while streaming low-resolution video for visual context. On a benchmark of text-based VQA samples across five task categories, our system achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on resource-constrained wearables without sacrificing text understanding quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote, video-based assessments offer a scalable pathway for Parkinson's disease (PD) screening. While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Zhang, Kai Jiang, Chendong Xiang, Weiqi Feng, Yuezhou Hu, Haocheng Xi, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many training-free sparse attention methods are effective for accelerating diffusion models. Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13549">Nighttime Autonomous Driving Scene Reconstruction with Physically-Based Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tae-Kyeong Kim, Xingxin Chen, Guile Wu, Chengjie Huang, Dongfeng Bai, Bingbing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on scene reconstruction under nighttime conditions in autonomous driving simulation. Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Wang, Lingling Li, Marcus Santos, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binglei Li, Mengping Yang, Zhiyu Tan, Junping Zhang, Hao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancement, yet faithfully following complex textual descriptions remains challenging due to insufficient interactions between textual and visual features. Prior approaches enhance such interactions via architectural design or handcrafted textual condition weighting, but lack flexibility and overlook the dynamic interactions across different blocks and denoising stages. To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing. Experiments on strong baselines (SD 3.5 and FLUX) demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference across various metrics. Our code and models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanfeng Tang, Hongbo Zhao, Ziwei Long, Jiayao Li, Bohong Xiao, Wei Ye, Hanli Wang, Rui Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system, which operates on two parallel yet interactive streams for contextual and spatial understanding, this article presents Two Interactive Streams (TwInS), a novel bio-inspired joint learning framework capable of simultaneously performing scene parsing and geometric vision tasks. TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Zhang, Feng Liu, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual attention boosting has emerged as a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where existing methods primarily focus on where to boost by applying a predefined scaling to the attention of method-specific visual tokens during autoregressive generation. In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step. Extensive experiments show that AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present \revise (\underline{Re}asoning with \underline{Vi}deo \underline{S}parsity), a multi-round agent for video question answering (VQA). Instead of uniformly sampling frames, \revise selects a small set of informative frames, maintains a summary-as-state across rounds, and stops early when confident. It supports proprietary vision-language models (VLMs) in a ``plug-and-play'' setting and enables reinforcement fine-tuning for open-source models. For fine-tuning, we introduce EAGER (Evidence-Adjusted Gain for Efficient Reasoning), an annotation-free reward with three terms: (1) Confidence gain: after new frames are added, we reward the increase in the log-odds gap between the correct option and the strongest alternative; (2) Summary sufficiency: at answer time we re-ask using only the last committed summary and reward success; (3) Correct-and-early stop: answering correctly within a small turn budget is rewarded. Across multiple VQA benchmarks, \revise improves accuracy while reducing frames, rounds, and prompt tokens, demonstrating practical sparse video reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In minimally invasive surgery, clinical decisions depend on real-time visual interpretation, yet intraoperative perception varies substantially across surgeons and procedures. This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual object tracking (VOT) plays a pivotal role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, especially under challenging conditions like unpredictable occlusion, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces LGTrack, a unified UAV tracking framework that integrates dynamic layer selection, efficient feature enhancement, and robust representation learning for occlusions. By employing a novel lightweight Global-Grouped Coordinate Attention (GGCA) module, LGTrack captures long-range dependencies and global contexts, enhancing feature discriminability with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, a lightweight Similarity-Guided Layer Adaptation (SGLA) module replaces knowledge distillation, achieving an optimal balance between tracking precision and inference efficiency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate LGTrack's state-of-the-art real-time speed (258.7 FPS on UAVDT) while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy (82.8\% precision).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhao, Yuang Zhang, Junqi Cheng, Jiaxi Gu, Zenghui Lu, Peng Shu, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generative models have demonstrated impressive visual fidelity, yet they often struggle with semantic, geometric, and identity consistency. In this paper, we propose a system-level framework, termed the Divide-and-Conquer Diffusion Model (DCDM), to address three key challenges: (1) intra-clip world knowledge consistency, (2) inter-clip camera consistency, and (3) inter-shot element consistency. DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our framework on the test set of the CVM Competition at AAAI'26, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategies effectively address these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byungjin Choi, Seongsu Bae, Sunjun Kweon, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce KorMedMCQA-V, a Korean medical licensing-exam-style multimodal multiple-choice question answering benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities. By complementing the text-only KorMedMCQA benchmark, KorMedMCQA-V forms a unified evaluation suite for Korean medical reasoning across text-only and multimodal conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Saadat, Nima Hashemi, Bahar Khodabakhshian, Michael Y. Tsang, Christina Luong, Teresa S. M. Tsang, Purang Abolmaesumi</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Echocardiography with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) must support clinical decision-making under tight bedside time and operator-effort constraints. We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds. These probabilities drive a reward that balances expected diagnostic benefit against acquisition cost, producing patient-specific acquisition pathways. Results: The dataset comprises 12,180 patient-level studies, split into training/validation/test sets (75/15/15). On the 1,820 test studies, our method matches full-study performance while using 32% fewer videos, achieving 77.2% mean balanced accuracy (bACC) across AS severity classification and LVEF estimation, demonstrating robust multi-task performance under acquisition budgets. Conclusion: Patient-tailored, cost-aware acquisition can streamline POCUS workflows while preserving decision quality, producing interpretable scan pathways suited to bedside use. The framework is extensible to additional cardiac endpoints and merits prospective evaluation for clinical integration.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13662">LeafNet: A Large-Scale Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmark for Foundational Vision-Language Understanding of Plant Diseases</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Khang Nguyen Quoc, Phuong D. Dao, Luyl-Da Quach</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rang Meng, Weipeng Wu, Yingjie Yin, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent multi-modal video generation models have achieved high visual quality, but their prohibitive latency and limited temporal stability hinder real-time deployment. Streaming inference exacerbates these issues, leading to pronounced multimodal degradation, such as spatial blurring, temporal drift, and lip desynchronization, which creates an unresolved efficiency-performance trade-off. To this end, we propose EchoTorrent, a novel schema with a fourfold design: (1) Multi-Teacher Training fine-tunes a pre-trained model on distinct preference domains to obtain specialized domain experts, which sequentially transfer domain-specific knowledge to a student model; (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration (ACC-DMD), which calibrates the audio CFG augmentation errors in DMD via a phased spatiotemporal schedule, eliminating redundant CFG computations and enabling single-pass inference per step; (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, which enforces alignment exclusively on tail frames during long-horizon self-rollout training via a causal-bidirectional hybrid architecture, effectively mitigates spatiotemporal degradation in streaming mode while enhancing fidelity to reference frames; and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner through pixel-domain optimization of the VAE decoder to recover high-frequency details while circumventing latent-space ambiguities. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maimoona Jafar, Syed Imran Ali, Ahsan Saadat, Muhammad Bilal, Shah Khalid</p>
<p>Abstract: Environmental pollution is a critical global issue, with recycling emerging as one of the most viable solutions. This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Yue Shi, Yalin Zheng, Uazman Alam, Maryam Ferdousi, Rayaz Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) is a sensitive tool for assessing small-fiber damage in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), yet the development of robust, automated deep learning-based diagnostic models is limited by scarce labelled data and fine-grained variability in corneal nerve morphology. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data. When used to train automated diagnostic models, the synthetic dataset improves downstream diagnostic accuracy by 2.1% and segmentation performance by 2.2%, validating the framework's potential to alleviate data bottlenecks in medical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chan Hao Sien, Hezerul Abdul Karim, Nouar AlDahoul</p>
<p>Abstract: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continuously affect a large proportion of the global population, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where access to specialized diagnostic expertise is limited. Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanjun Li, Weixuan Li, Han Xia, Junhua Zhou, Chi-Man Pun, Xuhang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic surgical systems rely heavily on high-quality visual feedback for precise teleoperation; yet, surgical smoke from energy-based devices significantly degrades endoscopic video feeds, compromising the human-robot interface and surgical outcomes. This paper presents RGA-Net (Reciprocal Gating and Attention-fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for smoke removal in robotic surgery workflows. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures. These practical benefits could be further validated through future clinical trials involving surgeon usability assessments. The proposed framework represents a significant step toward more reliable and safer robotic surgical systems through computational vision enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpeng Zhang, Zewei Yang, Jie Feng, Yuhui Zheng, Ronghua Shang, Mengxuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent query-based detectors have achieved remarkable progress, yet their performance remains constrained when handling objects with arbitrary orientations, especially for tiny objects capturing limited texture information. This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordi Mal\'e, Juan Fortea, Mateus Rozalem-Aranha, Neus Mart\'inez-Abad\'ias, Xavier Sevillano</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as segmentation, anomaly detection, and high-quality synthetic data generation. These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Yang, Rong Ou, Weisheng Xu, Jiaqi Xiong, Xintao Li, Taowen Wang, Luyu Zhu, Xu Jiang, Jing Tan, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing evaluations of text-to-motion generation focus on in-distribution textual inputs and a limited set of evaluation criteria, which restricts their ability to systematically assess model generalization and motion generation capabilities under complex out-of-distribution (OOD) textual conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a benchmark specifically designed for OOD text-to-motion evaluation, which includes a comprehensive analysis of 14 representative baseline models and the two datasets derived from evaluation results. Specifically, we construct an OOD prompt dataset consisting of 1,025 textual descriptions. Based on this prompt dataset, we introduce a unified evaluation framework that integrates LLM-based Evaluation, Multi-factor Motion evaluation, and Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that while different baseline models demonstrate strengths in areas such as text-to-motion semantic alignment, motion generalizability, and physical quality, most models struggle to achieve strong performance with Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. These findings highlight the limitations of existing methods in OOD scenarios and offer practical guidance for the design and evaluation of future production-level text-to-motion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Tao, Chaozheng Huang, Nan Wang, Han Lyu, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Xi Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models demonstrate strong performance on natural image understanding, yet exhibit limited capability in interpreting scientific images, including but not limited to schematic diagrams, experimental characterizations, and analytical charts. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-source MLLMs. The gap largely stems from existing datasets with limited domain coverage, coarse structural annotations, and weak semantic grounding. We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantitative biomechanical analysis is essential for clinical diagnosis and injury prevention but is often restricted to laboratories due to the high cost of optical motion capture systems. While multi-view video approaches have lowered barriers, they remain impractical for home-based scenarios requiring monocular capture. This paper presents SAM4Dcap, an open-source, end-to-end framework for estimating biomechanical metrics from monocular video without additional training. SAM4Dcap integrates the temporally consistent 4D human mesh recovery of SAM-Body4D with the OpenSim biomechanical solver. The pipeline converts reconstructed meshes into trajectory files compatible with diverse musculoskeletal models. We introduce automated prompting strategies and a Linux-native build for processing. Preliminary evaluations on walking and drop-jump tasks indicate that SAM4Dcap has the potential to achieve knee kinematic predictions comparable to multi-view systems, although some discrepancies in hip flexion and residual jitter remain. By bridging advanced computer vision with established biomechanical simulation, SAM4Dcap provides a flexible, accessible foundation for non-laboratory motion analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Li, Yitao Wu, Xian Wu, Haolin Zhuo, Lijun Zhao, Lining Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical component of the 4D auto-labeling (4DAL) process. It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13778">Skeleton2Stage: Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning for Physically Plausible Dance Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jidong Jia, Youjian Zhang, Huan Fu, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in dance generation, most methods are trained in the skeletal domain and ignore mesh-level physical constraints. As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengtong Shen, Li Yan, Hong Xie, Yaxuan Wei, Xinhao Li, Wenfei Shen, Peixian Lv, Fei Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) change detection methods can extract critical information on surface dynamics and are an essential means for humans to understand changes in the earth's surface and environment. Among these methods, semantic change detection (SCD) can more effectively interpret the multi-class information contained in bi-temporal RS imagery, providing semantic-level predictions that support dynamic change monitoring. However, due to the limited semantic understanding capability of the model and the inherent complexity of the SCD tasks, existing SCD methods face significant challenges in both performance and paradigm complexity. In this paper, we propose PerASCD, a SCD method driven by RS foundation model PerA, designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic understanding and overall performance. We introduce a modular Cascaded Gated Decoder (CG-Decoder) that simplifies complex SCD decoding pipelines while promoting effective multi-level feature interaction and fusion. In addition, we propose a Soft Semantic Consistency Loss (SSCLoss) to mitigate the numerical instability commonly encountered during SCD training. We further explore the applicability of multiple existing RS foundation models on the SCD task when equipped with the proposed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our decoder not only effectively simplifies the paradigm of SCD, but also achieves seamless adaptation across various vision encoders. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/SathShen/PerASCD.git.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Winding Reconstruction (DiWR), a robust method for reconstructing watertight surfaces from unoriented point clouds with non-uniform sampling, noise, and outliers. Our method uses the generalized winding number (GWN) field as the target implicit representation and jointly optimizes point orientations, per-point area weights, and confidence coefficients in a single pipeline. The optimization minimizes the Dirichlet energy of the induced winding field together with additional GWN-based constraints, allowing DiWR to compensate for non-uniform sampling, reduce the impact of noise, and downweight outliers during reconstruction, with no reliance on separate preprocessing. We evaluate DiWR on point clouds from 3D Gaussian Splatting, a computer-vision pipeline, and corrupted graphics benchmarks. Experiments show that DiWR produces plausible watertight surfaces on these challenging inputs and outperforms both traditional multi-stage pipelines and recent joint orientation-reconstruction methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos is critical for scalable robot learning, yet four-dimensional (4D) reconstruction under strictly monocular settings remains highly ill-posed. To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity. Our approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular casual videos. Experiments of dynamic novel-view synthesis (NVS) on benchmark and real-world manipulation datasets demonstrate considerable improvements over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongcheng Han, Dongyan Cao, Haoran Sun, Yu Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in auto-regressive transformers have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations. Specifically, existing approaches often suffer from information loss during encoding, causing representational distortion before the quantization process. This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text. Experiments demonstrate that VAR-3D significantly outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and text-3D alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Jiang, Yuji Wang, Yongjie Zhu, Xin Lu, Wenyu Qin, Meng Wang, Pengfei Wan, Yansong Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become pivotal for advancing Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) in addressing diverse cross-modal tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Bu, Yuanxin Xie, Guang-Quan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasound denoising is essential for mitigating speckle-induced degradations, thereby enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic reliability. Nevertheless, because speckle patterns inherently encode both texture and fine anatomical details, effectively suppressing noise while preserving structural fidelity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising, designed to promote noise-invariant and structure-aware feature representations by maximizing the separability between noisy and clean samples at both pixel and instance levels. Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details. Extensive evaluations on two publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cem Eteke, Batuhan Tosun, Alexander Griessel, Wolfgang Kellerer, Eckehard Steinbach</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a video diffusion model for high-fidelity, causal, and real-time video generation under ultra-low-bitrate semantic communication constraints. Our approach utilizes lossy semantic video coding to transmit the semantic scene structure, complemented by a stream of highly compressed, low-resolution frames that provide sufficient texture information to preserve fidelity. Building on these inputs, we introduce a modular video diffusion model that contains Semantic Control, Restoration Adapter, and Temporal Adapter. We further introduce an efficient temporal distillation procedure that enables extension to real-time and causal synthesis, reducing trainable parameters by 300x and training time by 2x, while adhering to communication constraints. Evaluated across diverse datasets, the framework achieves strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.0003 bpp), outperforming classical, neural, and generative baselines in extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a common and life-threatening condition in elderly patients, often treated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Despite procedural advances, paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVR) remains one of the most frequent post-TAVI complications, with a proven impact on long-term prognosis.
  In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the occurrence of PVR from preoperative cardiac CT. To this end, a dataset of preoperative TAVI patients was collected, and 3D convolutional neural networks were trained on isotropic CT volumes. The results achieved suggest that volumetric deep learning can capture subtle anatomical features from pre-TAVI imaging, opening new perspectives for personalized risk assessment and procedural optimization.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive workflow for generating and validating a synthetic dataset designed for robotic surgery instrument segmentation. A 3D reconstruction of the Da Vinci robotic arms was refined and animated in Autodesk Maya through a fully automated Python-based pipeline capable of producing photorealistic, labeled video sequences. Each scene integrates randomized motion patterns, lighting variations, and synthetic blood textures to mimic intraoperative variability while preserving pixel-accurate ground truth masks. To validate the realism and effectiveness of the generated data, several segmentation models were trained under controlled ratios of real and synthetic data. Results demonstrate that a balanced composition of real and synthetic samples significantly improves model generalization compared to training on real data only, while excessive reliance on synthetic data introduces a measurable domain shift. The proposed framework provides a reproducible and scalable tool for surgical computer vision, supporting future research in data augmentation, domain adaptation, and simulation-based pretraining for robotic-assisted surgery.

<p>Abstract: Cardiac Output (CO) is a key parameter in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. However, its accurate measurement requires right-heart catheterization, an invasive and time-consuming procedure, motivating the development of reliable non-invasive alternatives using echocardiography. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) pretraining strategy based on SimCLR to improve CO prediction from apical four-chamber echocardiographic videos. The pretraining is performed using the same limited dataset available for the downstream task, demonstrating the potential of SSL even under data scarcity. Our results show that SSL mitigates overfitting and improves representation learning, achieving an average Pearson correlation of 0.41 on the test set and outperforming PanEcho, a model trained on over one million echocardiographic exams.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Wolff, Thomas Klein, Evgenia Rusak, Felix Wichmann, Wieland Brendel</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on computer vision benchmarks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still fall short of adequately modeling human visual behavior, as measured by error consistency and shape bias. Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \emph{generative} -- rather than \emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.
  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.
  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamed Heidari-Gorji, Raquel Gil Rodriguez, Karl R. Gegenfurtner</p>
<p>Abstract: We previously investigated color constancy in photorealistic virtual reality (VR) and developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that predicts reflectance from rendered images. Here, we combine both approaches to compare and study a model and human performance with respect to established color constancy mechanisms: local surround, maximum flux and spatial mean. Rather than evaluating the model against physical ground truth, model performance was assessed using the same achromatic object selection task employed in the human experiments. The model, a ResNet based U-Net from our previous work, was pre-trained on rendered images to predict surface reflectance. We then applied transfer learning, fine-tuning only the network's decoder on images from the baseline VR condition. To parallel the human experiment, the model's output was used to perform the same achromatic object selection task across all conditions. Results show a strong correspondence between the model and human behavior. Both achieved high constancy under baseline conditions and showed similar, condition-dependent performance declines when the local surround or spatial mean color cues were removed.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose RPGD (RANSAC-P3P Gradient Descent), a human-pose-driven extrinsic calibration framework that robustly aligns MoCap-based 3D skeletal data with monocular or multi-view RGB cameras using only natural human motion. RPGD formulates extrinsic calibration as a coarse-to-fine problem tailored to human poses, combining the global robustness of RANSAC-P3P with Gradient-Descent-based refinement. We evaluate RPGD on three large-scale public 3D HPE datasets as well as on a self-collected in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that RPGD consistently recovers extrinsic parameters with accuracy comparable to the provided ground truth, achieving sub-pixel MPJPE reprojection error even in challenging, noisy settings. These results indicate that RPGD provides a practical and automatic solution for reliable extrinsic calibration of large-scale 3D HPE dataset collection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13930">MamaDino: A Hybrid Vision Model for Breast Cancer 3-Year Risk Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruggiero Santeramo, Igor Zubarev, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Breast cancer screening programmes increasingly seek to move from one-size-fits-all interval to risk-adapted and personalized strategies. Deep learning (DL) has enabled image-based risk models with stronger 1- to 5-year prediction than traditional clinical models, but leading systems (e.g., Mirai) typically use convolutional backbones, very high-resolution inputs (>1M pixels) and simple multi-view fusion, with limited explicit modelling of contralateral asymmetry.
  We hypothesised that combining complementary inductive biases (convolutional and transformer-based) with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling would allow us to match state-of-the-art 3-year risk prediction performance even when operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms, indicating that using less detailed images in a more structured way can recover state-of-the-art accuracy.
  We present MamaDino, a mammography-aware multi-view attentional DINO model. MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score. We train on 53,883 women from OPTIMAM (UK) and evaluate on matched 3-year case-control cohorts: an in-distribution test set from four screening sites and an external out-of-distribution cohort from an unseen site.
  At breast-level, MamaDino matches Mirai on both internal and external tests while using ~13x fewer input pixels. Adding the BilateralMixer improves discrimination to AUC 0.736 (vs 0.713) in-distribution and 0.677 (vs 0.666) out-of-distribution, with consistent performance across age, ethnicity, scanner, tumour type and grade. These findings demonstrate that explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable predictions that match Mirai, despite operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multimodal learning within computational pathology. Existing models primarily rely on vision and language modalities; however, language alone lacks molecular specificity and offers limited pathological supervision, leading to representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose STAMP, a Spatial Transcriptomics-Augmented Multimodal Pathology representation learning framework that integrates spatially-resolved gene expression profiles to enable molecule-guided joint embedding of pathology images and transcriptomic data. Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance. These results highlight the value and necessity of integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology. The code is included in the supplementary materials. The pretrained weights and SpaVis-6M are available at: https://github.com/Hanminghao/STAMP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data-driven approaches like deep learning are rapidly advancing planetary science, particularly in Mars exploration. Despite recent progress, most existing benchmarks remain confined to closed-set supervised visual tasks and do not support text-guided retrieval for geospatial discovery. We introduce MarsRetrieval, a retrieval benchmark for evaluating vision-language models for Martian geospatial discovery. MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models. Our evaluation shows MarsRetrieval is challenging: even strong foundation models often fail to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions. We further show that domain-specific fine-tuning is critical for generalizable geospatial discovery in planetary settings.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain highly computationally expensive. Previous acceleration methods, such as pruning and distillation, typically rely on a fixed computational capacity, leading to insufficient acceleration and degraded generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)}, an adaptive acceleration framework for DiT that effectively improves efficiency while maintaining generation quality. Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\sim$2$\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guandong Li, Mengxia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to integrate specific identities into arbitrary contexts. However, existing tuning-free methods typically employ Spatially Uniform Visual Injection, causing identity features to contaminate non-facial regions (e.g., backgrounds and lighting) and degrading text adherence. To address this without expensive fine-tuning, we propose SpatialID, a training-free spatially-adaptive identity modulation framework. SpatialID fundamentally decouples identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions using a Spatial Mask Extractor derived from cross-attention responses. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts spatial constraints - transitioning from Gaussian priors to attention-based masks and adaptive relaxation - to align with the diffusion generation dynamics. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that SpatialID achieves state-of-the-art performance in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), significantly eliminating background contamination while maintaining robust identity preservation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have enabled robust generalization in computational pathology through large-scale datasets and expansive architectures, but their substantial computational cost, particularly for gigapixel whole slide images, limits clinical accessibility and scalability. Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and tracking dynamic 3D scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing approaches often decouple geometry from motion: multi-view reconstruction methods assume static scenes, while dynamic tracking frameworks rely on explicit camera pose estimation or separate motion models. We propose Flow4R, a unified framework that treats camera-space scene flow as the central representation linking 3D structure, object motion, and camera motion. Flow4R predicts a minimal per-pixel property set-3D point position, scene flow, pose weight, and confidence-from two-view inputs using a Vision Transformer. This flow-centric formulation allows local geometry and bidirectional motion to be inferred symmetrically with a shared decoder in a single forward pass, without requiring explicit pose regressors or bundle adjustment. Trained jointly on static and dynamic datasets, Flow4R achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4D reconstruction and tracking tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the flow-central representation for spatiotemporal scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Li, Xiaomeng Fu, Xurui Peng, Weifeng Chen, Youwei Zheng, Tianyu Zhao, Jiexi Wang, Fangmin Chen, Xing Wang, Hayden Kwok-Hay So</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have emerged as a scalable paradigm for long video generation. However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the \textit{spectral bias} of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of \textit{dynamic priors} in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{FLEX} (\textbf{F}requency-aware \textbf{L}ength \textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14040">Explainability-Inspired Layer-Wise Pruning of Deep Neural Networks for Efficient Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Shukla, Nachiket Tapas</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\% mAP drop for a 6.2\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuang Ai, Jiaming Han, Shaobin Zhuang, Weijia Mao, Xuefeng Hu, Ziyan Yang, Zhenheng Yang, Huaibo Huang, Xiangyu Yue, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present BitDance, a scalable autoregressive (AR) image generator that predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices. With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Guan, Rongyuan Wu, Shuai Li, Wentao Zhu, Wenjun Zeng, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Wu, Chenxi Xie, Ruibin Li, Liyi Chen, Qiaosi Yi, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image editing has achieved impressive results with the development of large-scale generative models. However, existing models mainly focus on the editing effects of intended objects and regions, often leading to unwanted changes in unintended regions. We present a post-training framework for Content-Consistent Editing (CoCoEdit) via region regularized reinforcement learning. We first augment existing editing datasets with refined instructions and masks, from which 40K diverse and high quality samples are curated as training set. We then introduce a pixel-level similarity reward to complement MLLM-based rewards, enabling models to ensure both editing quality and content consistency during the editing process. To overcome the spatial-agnostic nature of the rewards, we propose a region-based regularizer, aiming to preserve non-edited regions for high-reward samples while encouraging editing effects for low-reward samples. For evaluation, we annotate editing masks for GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, introducing pixel-level similarity metrics to measure content consistency and editing quality. Applying CoCoEdit to Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, we achieve not only competitive editing scores with state-of-the-art models, but also significantly better content consistency, measured by PSNR/SSIM metrics and human subjective ratings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youqi Wang, Shen Chen, Haowei Wang, Rongxuan Peng, Taiping Yao, Shunquan Tan, Changsheng Chen, Bin Li, Shouhong Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image forgery detection and localization predominantly operate under a text-centric Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward. This paradigm empowers the MLLM to act as a proactive decision-maker, learning to spontaneously invoke multi-view reasoning paths including local zoom-in for fine-grained inspection and the analysis of invisible inconsistencies in compression history, noise residuals, and frequency domains. Extensive experiments reveal that ForgeryVCR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detection and localization tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness with minimal tool redundancy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmet Burak Yildirim, Tuna Saygin, Duygu Ceylan, Aysegul Dundar</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-image 3D reconstruction with large reconstruction models (LRMs) has advanced rapidly, yet reconstructions often exhibit geometric inconsistencies and misaligned details that limit fidelity. We introduce GeoFusionLRM, a geometry-aware self-correction framework that leverages the model's own normal and depth predictions to refine structural accuracy. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on features extracted from the input image, GeoFusionLRM feeds back geometric cues through a dedicated transformer and fusion module, enabling the model to correct errors and enforce consistency with the conditioning image. This design improves the alignment between the reconstructed mesh and the input views without additional supervision or external signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoFusionLRM achieves sharper geometry, more consistent normals, and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art LRM baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding. Yet, human perception is inherently multisensory, integrating sight, sound, and motion to reason about the world. Among these modalities, sound provides indispensable cues about spatial layout, off-screen events, and causal interactions, particularly in egocentric settings where auditory and visual signals are tightly coupled. To this end, we introduce EgoSound, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate egocentric sound understanding in MLLMs. EgoSound unifies data from Ego4D and EgoBlind, encompassing both sighted and sound-dependent experiences. It defines a seven-task taxonomy spanning intrinsic sound perception, spatial localization, causal inference, and cross-modal reasoning. Constructed through a multi-stage auto-generative pipeline, EgoSound contains 7315 validated QA pairs across 900 videos. Comprehensive experiments on nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that current models exhibit emerging auditory reasoning abilities but remain limited in fine-grained spatial and causal understanding. EgoSound establishes a challenging foundation for advancing multisensory egocentric intelligence, bridging the gap between seeing and truly hearing the world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Hongze Shen, Lexiang Tang, Xin Li, Xinpeng Ding, Yinsong Liu, Deqiang Jiang, Xing Sun, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in high-level visual understanding. However, extending these models to fine-grained dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, typically necessitates the incorporation of complex, task-specific decoders and other customizations. This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Fang, Yuzhen Lu, Xinyang Mu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional mechanized chestnut harvesting is too costly for small producers, non-selective, and prone to damaging nuts. Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Han, Zixin Yang, Yonghao Long, Lin Zhang, Peter Kazanzides, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Precise port placement is a critical step in robot-assisted surgery, where port configuration influences both visual access to the operative field and instrument maneuverability. To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface. The system facilitates efficient intraoperative setup and demonstrates potential for seamless integration into routine clinical workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-driven image and video editing can be naturally cast as inpainting problems, where masked regions are reconstructed to remain consistent with both the observed content and the editing prompt. Recent advances in test-time guidance for diffusion and flow models provide a principled framework for this task; however, existing methods rely on costly vector--Jacobian product (VJP) computations to approximate the intractable guidance term, limiting their practical applicability. Building upon the recent work of Moufad et al.

Our results demonstrate that test-time guidance alone can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases surpass, training-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present UniRef-Image-Edit, a high-performance multi-modal generation system that unifies single-image editing and multi-image composition within a single framework. Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengxiang Wang, Mingshuo Chen, Yueying Li, Yajie Yang, Yifan Zhang, Long Lan, Xue Yang, Hongda Sun, Yulin Wang, Di Wang, Jun Song, Jing Zhang, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: The "thinking-with-images" paradigm enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to actively explore visual scenes via zoom-in tools. This is essential for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing VQA, where task-relevant cues are sparse and tiny. However, we observe a consistent failure mode in existing zoom-enabled MLLMs: Tool Usage Homogenization, where tool calls collapse into task-agnostic patterns, limiting effective evidence acquisition. To address this, we propose GeoEyes, a staged training framework consisting of (1) a cold-start SFT dataset, UHR Chain-of-Zoom (UHR-CoZ), which covers diverse zooming regimes, and (2) an agentic reinforcement learning method, AdaZoom-GRPO, that explicitly rewards evidence gain and answer improvement during zoom interactions. The resulting model learns on-demand zooming with proper stopping behavior and achieves substantial improvements on UHR remote sensing benchmarks, with 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Chen, Bo Peng, Lianchen Jia, Zeyu Zhang, Tianchi Huang, Lifeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Content-aware streaming requires dynamic, chunk-level importance weights to optimize subjective quality of experience (QoE). However, direct human annotation is prohibitively expensive while vision-saliency models generalize poorly. We introduce HiVid, the first framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a scalable human proxy to generate high-fidelity weights for both Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live streaming. We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm. (3) For live streaming which requires low-latency, online inference without future knowledge, we propose a prediction module to predict future weights with a multi-modal time series model, which comprises a content-aware attention and adaptive horizon to accommodate asynchronous LLM inference. Extensive experiments show HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5\% for VOD and 26\% for live streaming over SOTA baselines. Real-world user study validates HiVid boosts streaming QoE correlation by 14.7\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunal Swami, Sudha Velusamy, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula</p>
<p>Abstract: Removing fence occlusions from single images is a challenging task that degrades visual quality and limits downstream computer vision applications. Existing methods often fail on static scenes or require motion cues from multiple frames. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first framework to leverage dual-pixel (DP) sensors for this problem. We propose Freq-DP Net, a novel dual-branch network that fuses two complementary priors: a geometric prior from defocus disparity, modeled using an explicit cost volume, and a structural prior of the fence's global pattern, learned via Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). An attention mechanism intelligently merges these cues for highly accurate fence segmentation. To validate our approach, we build and release a diverse benchmark with different fence varieties. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong general-purpose baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art for single-image, DP-based fence removal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prachi Kudeshia, Jiju Poovvancheri</p>
<p>Abstract: Geometry and topology constitute complementary descriptors of three-dimensional shape, yet existing benchmark datasets primarily capture geometric information while neglecting topological structure. This work addresses this limitation by introducing topologically-enriched versions of ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, where each point cloud is augmented with its corresponding persistent homology features. These benchmarks with the topological signatures establish a foundation for unified geometry-topology learning and enable systematic evaluation of topology-aware deep learning architectures for 3D shape analysis. Building on this foundation, we propose a deep learning-based significant persistent point selection method, \textit{TopoGAT}, that learns to identify the most informative topological features directly from input data and the corresponding topological signatures, circumventing the limitations of hand-crafted statistical selection criteria. A comparative study verifies the superiority of the proposed method over traditional statistical approaches in terms of stability and discriminative power. Integrating the selected significant persistent points into standard point cloud classification and part-segmentation pipelines yields improvements in both classification accuracy and segmentation metrics. The presented topologically-enriched datasets, coupled with our learnable significant feature selection approach, enable the broader integration of persistent homology into the practical deep learning workflows for 3D point cloud analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Sai, Dheeraj Sai, Srinath B, Girish Varma, Priyesh Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-based object addition is often hindered by the ambiguity of text-only prompts or the tedious nature of mask-based inputs. To address this usability gap, we introduce AbracADDbra, a user-friendly framework that leverages intuitive touch priors to spatially ground succinct instructions for precise placement. Our efficient, decoupled architecture uses a vision-language transformer for touch-guided placement, followed by a diffusion model that jointly generates the object and an instance mask for high-fidelity blending. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we contribute the Touch2Add benchmark for this interactive task. Our extensive evaluations, where our placement model significantly outperforms both random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, confirm the framework's ability to produce high-fidelity edits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality, validating our decoupled approach. This work thus paves the way for more accessible and efficient creative tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Said Gurbuz, Sunghwan Hong, Ahmed Nassar, Marc Pollefeys, Peter Staar</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern computer-use agents (CUA) must perceive a screen as a structured state, what elements are visible, where they are, and what text they contain, before they can reliably ground instructions and act. Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas L. Teigen, Annette Stahl, Rudolf Mester</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in computer vision is the two-frame relative pose optimization problem. Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Areez Muhammed Shabu, Mohammad Samar Ansari, Asra Aslam</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shun Kato (Keio University, Japan), Yasushi Kondo (Keio University, Japan), Shuntaro Saito (Keio University, Japan), Yoshimitsu Aoki (Keio University, Japan), Mariko Isogawa (Keio University, Japan)</p>
<p>Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Wu, Wei Zhai, Yuxin Cui, Tiesong Zhao, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Deformation Measurement (VDM) aims to recover dense deformation fields by tracking surface motion from camera observations. Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate. Remarkably, it achieves this using only 18.9% of the data storage and processing resources of high-speed video methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Fosdick (Daydream)</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In Chong Choi, Jiacheng Zhang, Feng Liu, Yiliao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are effective against text-only large language models (LLMs) by gradually introducing malicious content across turns. When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqian Yang, Hao Wang, Sai Qian Zhang, Jian Li, Yang Hua, Miao Pan, Tao Song, Zhengwei Qi, Haibing Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation VLN requires large-scale trajectory instruction data from private indoor environments, raising significant privacy concerns. Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Zhu, Zhaorui Yang, Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial perception aims to estimate camera motion and scene structure from visual observations, a problem traditionally addressed through geometric modeling and physical consistency constraints. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.
  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.
  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourya Saha, Md. Nurul Absur</p>
<p>Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) systems deployed in industrial and operational settings rely on Visual--Inertial Odometry (VIO) for continuous six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking, yet these environments often involve sensing conditions that deviate from ideal assumptions. Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Li, Yi Ren, Yizhe Zhang, Wenhua Zhang, Tianyi Zhang, Muyun Jiang, Guo-Sen Xie, Cuntai Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Action Unit (AU) detection seeks to recognize subtle facial muscle activations as defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gagandeep Singh, Samudi Amarasinghe, Priyanka Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal misinformation increasingly mixes realistic im-age edits with fluent but misleading text, producing persuasive posts that are difficult to verify. Existing systems usually rely on a single evidence source. Content-based detectors identify local inconsistencies within an image and its caption but cannot determine global factual truth. Retrieval-based fact-checkers reason over external evidence but treat inputs as coarse claims and often miss subtle visual or textual manipulations. This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanqing Guo, Xi Liu, Yufei Wang, Zhihao Li, Siyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have achieved remarkable visual quality, while a fundamental challenge remains: Can image generation be controlled at the element level, enabling intuitive modifications such as adjusting shapes, altering colors, or adding and removing objects? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Nie, Zixiang Li, Renshuai Tao, Bin Wu, Yunchao Wei, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferring visual style between images while preserving semantic correspondence between similar objects remains a central challenge in computer vision. While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ding, Zhichuan Yang, Weijie Ge, Ziqin Gao, Chaoyi Lu, Lei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We address fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where key evidence may reside in tiny objects, cluttered regions, or subtle markings that are lost under a single global image encoding. We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Liu, Fumio Okura</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled high-fidelity virtualization with fast rendering and optimization for novel view synthesis. On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware multimodal segmentation framework that leverages both radiological images and associated clinical text for precise medical diagnosis. We propose a Modality Decoding Attention Block (MoDAB) with a lightweight State Space Mixer (SSMix) to enable efficient cross-modal fusion and long-range dependency modelling. To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty modelling and structured modality alignment in vision-language medical segmentation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chentao Li, Pan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The tumor region plays a key role in pathological diagnosis. Tumor tissues are highly similar to precancerous lesions and non tumor instances often greatly exceed tumor instances in whole slide images (WSIs). These issues cause instance-semantic entanglement in multi-instance learning frameworks, degrading both model representation capability and interpretability. To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingrui Ma, Chentao Li, Pan Huang, Jing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are the gold standard for pathological diagnosis and sub-typing. Current main-stream two-step frameworks employ offline feature encoders trained without domain-specific knowledge. Among them, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are outcome-oriented and offer limited interpretability. Clustering-based approaches can provide explainable decision-making process but suffer from high dimension features and semantically ambiguous centroids. To this end, we propose an end-to-end MIL framework that integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, where the manifold geometric structure facilitates robust clustering results. Furthermore, we design a prior knowledge guiding proxy instance labeling and aggregation strategy to approximate patch labels and focus on pathologically relevant tumor regions. Experiments on multicentre WSI datasets demonstrate that: 1) our cluster-incorporated model achieves superior performance in both grading accuracy and interpretability; 2) end-to-end learning refines better feature representations and it requires acceptable computation resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image generation is pivotal in applications like data augmentation for low-resource clinical tasks and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Das, Koushik Biswas, Swalpa Kumar Roy, Badri Narayana Patro, Vinay Kumar Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

<p>Abstract: Rapid and accurate building damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of tornadoes is critical for coordinating life-saving search and rescue operations, optimizing emergency resource allocation, and accelerating community recovery. However, current automated methods struggle with the unique visual complexity of tornado-induced wreckage, primarily due to severe domain shift from standard pre-training datasets and extreme class imbalance in real-world disaster data. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ari Vesalainen, Eetu M\"akel\"a, Laura Ruotsalainen, Mikko Tolonen</p>
<p>Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of eighteenth-century printed texts remains challenging due to degraded print quality, archaic glyphs, and non-standardized orthography. Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.
  While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Zhao, Yuan Gao, Yang Xia, Sheng Nie, Jun Yue, Weiwei Sun, Shaobo Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain-generalized LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) seeks to train models on source-domain point clouds that generalize reliably to multiple unseen target domains, which is essential for real-world LiDAR applications. However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions.

<p>Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) concerns the synthesis of realistic person imagery through garment re-rendering under human pose and body constraints. In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications.

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness.

<p>Abstract: You Only Look Once (YOLO) has been the prominent model for computer vision in deep learning for a decade. This study explores the novel aspects of YOLO26, the most recent version in the YOLO series. The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aswathi Varma, Suprosanna Shit, Chinmay Prabhakar, Daniel Scholz, Hongwei Bran Li, Bjoern Menze, Daniel Rueckert, Benedikt Wiestler</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

<p>Abstract: We introduce VIGIL (Visual Inconsistency & Generative In-context Lucidity), the first benchmark dataset and framework providing a fine-grained categorization of hallucinations in the multimodal image recontextualization task for large multimodal models (LMMs). While existing research often treats hallucinations as a uniform issue, our work addresses a significant gap in multimodal evaluation by decomposing these errors into five categories: pasted object hallucinations, background hallucinations, object omission, positional & logical inconsistencies, and physical law violations. To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task. To promote transparency and further exploration, we openly release VIGIL, along with the detection pipeline and benchmark code, through our GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlubneuskaya/vigil and Data repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/joannaww/VIGIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Bourouis, Mikhail Bessmeltsev, Yulia Gryaditskaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in generative AI, with natural language emerging as the most common conditioning input. As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenjun Zhao, Heng Yang, Bangyan Liao, Yingping Zeng, Shaocheng Yan, Yingdong Gu, Peidong Liu, Yi Zhou, Haoang Li, Javier Civera</p>
<p>Abstract: Global solvers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D vision, offering certifiable solutions to nonconvex geometric optimization problems traditionally addressed by local or heuristic methods. This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanhui Lee, Seunghyun Shin, Donggyu Choi, Hae-gon Jeon, Jeany Son</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled powerful image editing capabilities guided by natural language prompts, unlocking new creative possibilities. However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Willem Davison, Xinyue Hao, Laura Sevilla-Lara</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal information has long been considered to be essential for perception. While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingxin Ke, Qunjie Zhou, Jiahui Huang, Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Konrad Schindler, Laura Leal-Taix\'e, Shengyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce CAPA, a parameter-efficient test-time optimization framework that adapts pre-trained 3D foundation models (FMs) for depth completion, using sparse geometric cues. Unlike prior methods that train task-specific encoders for auxiliary inputs, which often overfit and generalize poorly, CAPA freezes the FM backbone. Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures. For videos, CAPA introduces sequence-level parameter sharing, jointly adapting all frames to exploit temporal correlations, improve robustness, and enforce multi-frame consistency. CAPA is model-agnostic, compatible with any ViT-based FM, and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse condition patterns on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shishir Muralidhara, Didier Stricker, Ren\'e Schuster</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning remains constrained by the need for repeated retraining, high computational costs, and the persistent challenge of forgetting. These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shih-Fang Chen, Jun-Cheng Chen, I-Hong Jhuo, Yen-Yu Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Cho, Hyunwoo Yu, Kyeongbo Kong, Kyomin Sohn, Bongjoon Hyun, Suk-Ju Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Pan, Yonekura Shogo, Yasuo Kuniyosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a "shortcut regime" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Mur Labadia, Ruben Martinez-Cantin, Jose J. Guerrero, Giovanni M. Farinella, Antonino Furnari</p>
<p>Abstract: Short Term object-interaction Anticipation consists in detecting the location of the next active objects, the noun and verb categories of the interaction, as well as the time to contact from the observation of egocentric video. This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xiang Wang, Guo-Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a multi-dimensional persistent sheaf Laplacian (MPSL) framework on simplicial complexes for image analysis. The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.</p>

Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis.

<p>Abstract: Aligning ground-level imagery with geo-registered satellite maps is crucial for mapping, navigation, and situational awareness, yet remains challenging under large viewpoint gaps or when GPS is unreliable. We introduce Wrivinder, a zero-shot, geometry-driven framework that aggregates multiple ground photographs to reconstruct a consistent 3D scene and align it with overhead satellite imagery. Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Jaemin Cho, Yue Zhang, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Shrivastava, Kirtan Gangani, Laksh Jain, Mayank Goel, Nipun Batra</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.</p>

Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehonathan Litman, Shikun Liu, Dario Seyb, Nicholas Milef, Yang Zhou, Carl Marshall, Shubham Tulsiani, Caleb Leak</p>
<p>Abstract: High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Xiong, Chunyi Peng, Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Zulong Chen, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by incorporating external visual documents to address a given query. Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Xiao, Kai Yin, Ali Mostafavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Timely and spatially resolved disaster impact assessment is essential for effective emergency response. However, automated methods typically struggle with temporal asynchrony. Real-time human reports capture peak hazard conditions while high-resolution satellite imagery is frequently acquired after peak conditions. This often reflects flood recession rather than maximum extent. Naive fusion of these misaligned streams can yield dangerous underestimates when post-event imagery overrides documented peak flooding. We present CrisiSense-RAG, which is a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that reframes impact assessment as evidence synthesis over heterogeneous data sources without disaster-specific fine-tuning. The system employs hybrid dense-sparse retrieval for text sources and CLIP-based retrieval for aerial imagery. A split-pipeline architecture feeds into asynchronous fusion logic that prioritizes real-time social evidence for peak flood extent while treating imagery as persistent evidence of structural damage. Evaluated on Hurricane Harvey across 207 ZIP-code queries, the framework achieves a flood extent MAE of 10.94% to 28.40% and damage severity MAE of 16.47% to 21.65% in zero-shot settings. Prompt-level alignment proves critical for quantitative validity because metric grounding improves damage estimates by up to 4.75 percentage points. These results demonstrate a practical and deployable approach to rapid resilience intelligence under real-world data constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin, Longwei Wang, Xiao Qin, Yang Zhou, KC Santosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image analysis requires substantial labeled data for model training, yet expert annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Active learning (AL) addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative samples for the annotation purpose, but traditional methods solely rely on predictive uncertainty while ignoring whether models learn from clinically meaningful features a critical requirement for clinical deployment. We propose an explainability-guided active learning framework that integrates spatial attention alignment into a sample acquisition process. Our approach advocates for a dual-criterion selection strategy combining: (i) classification uncertainty to identify informative examples, and (ii) attention misalignment with radiologist-defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) to target samples where the model focuses on incorrect features. By measuring misalignment between Grad-CAM attention maps and expert annotations using \emph{Dice similarity}, our acquisition function judiciously identifies samples that enhance both predictive performance and spatial interpretability. We evaluate the framework using three expert-annotated medical imaging datasets, namely, BraTS (MRI brain tumors), VinDr-CXR (chest X-rays), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-rays). Using only 570 strategically selected samples, our explainability-guided approach consistently outperforms random sampling across all the datasets, achieving 77.22\% accuracy on BraTS, 52.37\% on VinDr-CXR, and 52.66\% on SIIM-COVID. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that the models trained by our dual-criterion selection focus on diagnostically relevant regions, demonstrating that incorporating explanation guidance into sample acquisition yields superior data efficiency while maintaining clinical interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daesik Jang, Morgan Lindsay Heisler, Linzi Xing, Yifei Li, Edward Wang, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically generating and iteratively editing academic slide decks requires more than document summarization. It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing.

<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) enables atlas-scale profiling of complex tissues, revealing rare lineages and transient states. Yet, assigning biologically valid cell identities remains a bottleneck because markers are tissue- and state-dependent, and novel states lack references. We present CellMaster, an AI agent that mimics expert practice for zero-shot cell-type annotation. Unlike existing automated tools, CellMaster leverages LLM-encoded knowledge (e.g., GPT-4o) to perform on-the-fly annotation with interpretable rationales, without pre-training or fixed marker databases. Across 9 datasets spanning 8 tissues, CellMaster improved accuracy by 7.1% over best-performing baselines (including CellTypist and scTab) in automatic mode. With human-in-the-loop refinement, this advantage increased to 18.6%, with a 22.1% gain on subtype populations. The system demonstrates particular strength in rare and novel cell states where baselines often fail.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooya Ashtari, Pourya Behmandpoor, Nikos Deligiannis, Aleksandra Pizurica</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as powerful tools for encoding signals, yet dominant MLP-based designs often suffer from slow convergence, overfitting to noise, and poor extrapolation. We introduce FUTON (Fourier Tensor Network), which models signals as generalized Fourier series whose coefficients are parameterized by a low-rank tensor decomposition. FUTON implicitly expresses signals as weighted combinations of orthonormal, separable basis functions, combining complementary inductive biases: Fourier bases capture smoothness and periodicity, while the low-rank parameterization enforces low-dimensional spectral structure. We provide theoretical guarantees through a universal approximation theorem and derive an inference algorithm with complexity linear in the spectral resolution and the input dimension. On image and volume representation, FUTON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLP-based INRs while training 2--5$\times$ faster. On inverse problems such as image denoising and super-resolution, FUTON generalizes better and converges faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajian Zeng, Lingyun Chen, Jiaqi Yang, Yuantai Zhang, Fan Shi, Peidong Liu, Xingxing Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Gao, Zheng Gong, Wenli Liu, Yanhai Gan, Zhuoran Zheng, Junyu Dong, Qian Du</p>
<p>Abstract: While Mamba models offer efficient sequence modeling, vanilla versions struggle with temporal correlations and boundary details in Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) prediction. To address these limitations, we propose Frequency-enhanced Hilbert scanning Mamba Framework (FH-Mamba) for short-term Arctic SIC prediction. Specifically, we introduce a 3D Hilbert scan mechanism that traverses the 3D spatiotemporal grid along a locality-preserving path, ensuring that adjacent indices in the flattened sequence correspond to neighboring voxels in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, we incorporate wavelet transform to amplify high-frequency details and we also design a Hybrid Shuffle Attention module to adaptively aggregate sequence and frequency features. Experiments conducted on the OSI-450a1 and AMSR2 datasets demonstrate that our FH-Mamba achieves superior prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The results confirm the effectiveness of Hilbert scanning and frequency-aware attention in improving both temporal consistency and edge reconstruction for Arctic SIC forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Wang, Guangda Huzhang, Yuwei Hu, Yu Xia, Shiyin Lu, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Lijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have substantially driven the progress of autonomous agents for Graphical User Interface (GUI). Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonju Lee, Matteo Grimaldi, Tao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Insertion tasks in robotic manipulation demand precise, contact-rich interactions that vision alone cannot resolve. While tactile feedback is intuitively valuable, existing studies have shown that na\"ive visuo-tactile fusion often fails to deliver consistent improvements. In this work, we propose a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for visuo-tactile fusion that integrates wrist-camera observations with tactile signals through structured self- and cross-attention. To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing na\"ive and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged "wrist + contact force" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we presented Pailitao-VL, a comprehensive multi-modal retrieval system engineered for high-precision, real-time industrial search. We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods. Extensive offline benchmarks and online A/B tests on Alibaba e-commerce platform confirm that Pailitao-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers substantial business impact. This work demonstrates a robust and scalable path for deploying advanced MLLM-based retrieval architectures in demanding, large-scale production environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongkang Jin, Jianwen Luo, Jingjing Wang, Jianmin Yao, Yu Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) aims to identify events and their arguments from documents that contain both text and images. It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph property detection aims to determine whether a graph exhibits certain structural properties, such as being Hamiltonian. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown great promise by leveraging data-driven models to detect graph properties efficiently. In particular, vision-based methods offer a visually intuitive solution by processing the visualizations of graphs. However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various tasks such as Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfonso Mart\'inez-Petersen, Levin Gerdes, David Rodr\'iguez-Mart\'inez, C. J. P\'erez-del-Pulgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Planetary exploration increasingly relies on autonomous robotic systems capable of perceiving, interpreting, and reconstructing their surroundings in the absence of global positioning or real-time communication with Earth. Rovers operating on planetary surfaces must navigate under sever environmental constraints, limited visual redundancy, and communication delays, making onboard spatial awareness and visual localization key components for mission success. Traditional techniques based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) provide geometric consistency but struggle to capture radiometric detail or to scale efficiently in unstructured, low-texture terrains typical of extraterrestrial environments. This work explores the integration of radiance field-based methods - specifically Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting - into a unified, automated environment reconstruction pipeline for planetary robotics. Our system combines the Nerfstudio and COLMAP frameworks with a ROS2-compatible workflow capable of processing raw rover data directly from rosbag recordings. This approach enables the generation of dense, photorealistic, and metrically consistent 3D representations from minimal visual input, supporting improved perception and planning for autonomous systems operating in planetary-like conditions. The resulting pipeline established a foundation for future research in radiance field-based mapping, bridging the gap between geometric and neural representations in planetary exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Zhang, Zixi Kang, Ruijie Zhao, Yusen Feng, Biao Jiang, Libin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied social agents have recently advanced in generating synchronized speech and gestures. However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driving fatigue is a major contributor to traffic accidents and poses a serious threat to road safety. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measurement of neural activity, yet EEG-based fatigue recognition is hindered by strong non-stationarity and asymmetric neural dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose DeltaGateNet, a novel framework that explicitly captures Bidirectional temporal dynamics for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition. Our key idea is to introduce a Bidirectional Delta module that decomposes first-order temporal differences into positive and negative components, enabling explicit modeling of asymmetric neural activation and suppression patterns. Furthermore, we design a Gated Temporal Convolution module to capture long-term temporal dependencies for each EEG channel using depthwise temporal convolutions and residual learning, preserving channel-wise specificity while enhancing temporal representation robustness. Extensive experiments conducted under both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation settings on the public SEED-VIG and SADT driving fatigue datasets demonstrate that DeltaGateNet consistently outperforms existing methods. On SEED-VIG, DeltaGateNet achieves an intra-subject accuracy of 81.89% and an inter-subject accuracy of 55.55%. On the balanced SADT 2022 dataset, it attains intra-subject and inter-subject accuracies of 96.81% and 83.21%, respectively, while on the unbalanced SADT 2952 dataset, it achieves 96.84% intra-subject and 84.49% inter-subject accuracy. These results indicate that explicitly modeling Bidirectional temporal dynamics yields robust and generalizable performance under varying subject and class-distribution conditions.</p>

To illustrate its application, we focus on material classification: high-resolution Digit tactile readings are processed by a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate local material predictions, which are then embedded into an augmented signed distance field (SDF) network that jointly predicts geometry and continuous material regions. Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal document question answering methods universally adopt a supply-side ingestion strategy: running a Vision-Language Model (VLM) on every page during indexing to generate comprehensive descriptions, then answering questions through text retrieval. However, this "pre-ingestion" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is "Index for locating, not understanding"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the "QA accuracy" problem into a "page localization" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Chen, Muqing Jiang, Kaifeng Zheng, Jiaqi Liang, Chenrui Tie, Haoran Lu, Ruihai Wu, Hao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated object manipulation is essential for various real-world robotic tasks, yet generalizing across diverse objects remains a major challenge. A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung Nguyen, An Le, Truong Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for novel view synthesis. However, the number of Gaussian primitives often grows substantially during training as finer scene details are reconstructed, leading to increased memory and storage costs. Recent coarse-to-fine strategies regulate Gaussian growth by modulating the frequency content of the ground-truth images. In particular, AutoOpti3DGS employs the learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enable data-adaptive frequency modulation. Nevertheless, its modulation depth is limited by the 1-level DWT, and jointly optimizing wavelet regularization with 3D reconstruction introduces gradient competition that promotes excessive Gaussian densification. In this paper, we propose a multi-level DWT-based frequency modulation framework for 3DGS. By recursively decomposing the low-frequency subband, we construct a deeper curriculum that provides progressively coarser supervision during early training, consistently reducing Gaussian counts. Furthermore, we show that the modulation can be performed using only a single scaling parameter, rather than learning the full 2-tap high-pass filter. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method further reduces Gaussian counts while maintaining competitive rendering quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Gr\"oger, Shuo Wen, Maria Brbi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzan Farnia, Mohammad Jalali, Azim Ospanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Woerner, Seong Joon Oh, Christian F. Baumgartner</p>
<p>Abstract: Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like "universal" and "general-purpose" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pramit Saha, Joshua Strong, Mohammad Alsharid, Divyanshu Mishra, J. Alison Noble</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single "best" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neurosim is a fast, real-time, high-performance library for simulating sensors such as dynamic vision sensors, RGB cameras, depth sensors, and inertial sensors. It can also simulate agile dynamics of multi-rotor vehicles in complex and dynamic environments. Neurosim can achieve frame rates as high as ~2700 FPS on a desktop GPU. Neurosim integrates with a ZeroMQ-based communication library called Cortex to facilitate seamless integration with machine learning and robotics workflows. Cortex provides a high-throughput, low-latency message-passing system for Python and C++ applications, with native support for NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors. This paper discusses the design philosophy behind Neurosim and Cortex. It demonstrates how they can be used to (i) train neuromorphic perception and control algorithms, e.g., using self-supervised learning on time-synchronized multi-modal data, and (ii) test real-time implementations of these algorithms in closed-loop.

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of heart and blood vessel disorders that is one of the most serious dangers to human health, and the number of such patients is still growing. Early and accurate detection plays a key role in successful treatment and intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for identifying a variety of cardiovascular abnormalities. In clinical practices and most of the current research, standard 12-lead ECG is mainly used. However, using a lower number of leads can make ECG more prevalent as it can be conveniently recorded by portable or wearable devices. In this research, we develop a novel deep learning system to accurately identify multiple cardiovascular abnormalities by using only three ECG leads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinrui Wang, Zhuoru Li, Xiao Zhou, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Portrait Stylization aims to imbue portrait photos with vivid artistic effects drawn from style examples. Despite the availability of enormous training datasets and large network weights, existing methods struggle to maintain geometric consistency and achieve satisfactory stylization effects due to the disparity in facial feature distributions between facial photographs and stylized images, limiting the application on rare styles and mobile devices. To alleviate this, we propose to establish meaningful geometric correlations between portraits and style samples to simplify the stylization by aligning corresponding facial characteristics. Specifically, we integrate differentiable Thin-Plate-Spline (TPS) modules into an end-to-end Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to improve the training efficiency and promote the consistency of facial identities. By leveraging inherent structural information of faces, e.g., facial landmarks, TPS module can establish geometric alignments between the two domains, at global and local scales, both in pixel and feature spaces, thereby overcoming the aforementioned challenges. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons on a range of portrait stylization tasks demonstrate that our models not only outperforms existing models in terms of fidelity and stylistic consistency, but also achieves remarkable improvements in 2x training data efficiency and 100x less computational complexity, allowing our lightweight model to achieve real-time inference (30 FPS) at 512*512 resolution on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video prediction is a complex time-series forecasting task with great potential in many use cases. However, traditional methods prioritize accuracy and overlook slow prediction speeds due to complex model structures, redundant information, and excessive GPU memory consumption. These methods often predict frames sequentially, making acceleration difficult and limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios like danger prediction and warning.Therefore, we propose a transformer-based keypoint prediction neural network (TKN). TKN extracts dynamic content from video frames in an unsupervised manner, reducing redundant feature computation. And, TKN uses an acceleration matrix to reduce the computational cost of attention and employs a parallel computing structure for prediction acceleration. To the best of our knowledge, TKN is the first real-time video prediction solution that achieves a prediction rate of 1,176 fps, significantly reducing computation costs while maintaining other performance. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our method, suggesting that TKN has great application potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative modeling in machine learning aims to synthesize new data samples that are statistically similar to those observed during training. While conventional generative models such as GANs and diffusion models typically assume access to large and diverse datasets, many real-world applications (e.g. in medicine, satellite imaging, and artistic domains) operate under limited data availability and strict constraints. In this survey, we examine Generative Modeling under Data Constraint (GM-DC), which includes limited-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings. We present a unified perspective on the key challenges in GM-DC, including overfitting, frequency bias, and incompatible knowledge transfer, and discuss how these issues impact model performance. To systematically analyze this growing field, we introduce two novel taxonomies: one categorizing GM-DC tasks (e.g. unconditional vs. conditional generation, cross-domain adaptation, and subject-driven modeling), and another organizing methodological approaches (e.g. transfer learning, data augmentation, meta-learning, and frequency-aware modeling). Our study reviews over 230 papers, offering a comprehensive view across generative model types and constraint scenarios. We further analyze task-approach-method interactions using a Sankey diagram and highlight promising directions for future work, including adaptation of foundation models, holistic evaluation frameworks, and data-centric strategies for sample selection. This survey provides a timely and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to advance generative modeling under limited data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Long Ho, Cuong Do, Danh Le-Phuoc, Kok-Seng Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain shift is a formidable issue in Machine Learning that causes a model to suffer from performance degradation when tested on unseen domains. Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG) attempts to train a global model using collaborative clients in a privacy-preserving manner that can generalize well to unseen clients possibly with domain shift. However, most existing FedDG methods either cause additional privacy risks of data leakage or induce significant costs in client communication and computation, which are major concerns in the Federated Learning paradigm. To circumvent these challenges, here we introduce a novel architectural method for FedDG, namely gPerXAN, which relies on a normalization scheme working with a guiding regularizer. In particular, we carefully design Personalized eXplicitly Assembled Normalization to enforce client models selectively filtering domain-specific features that are biased towards local data while retaining discrimination of those features. Then, we incorporate a simple yet effective regularizer to guide these models in directly capturing domain-invariant representations that the global model's classifier can leverage. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets, i.e., PACS and Office-Home, and a real-world medical dataset, Camelyon17, indicate that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods in addressing this particular problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Story-Iter, a new training-free iterative paradigm to enhance long-story generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed reference images to construct a complete story, our approach features a novel external iterative paradigm, extending beyond the internal iterative denoising steps of diffusion models, to continuously refine each generated image by incorporating all reference images from the previous round. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play, training-free global reference cross-attention (GRCA) module, modeling all reference frames with global embeddings, ensuring semantic consistency in long sequences. By progressively incorporating holistic visual context and text constraints, our iterative paradigm enables precise generation with fine-grained interactions, optimizing the story visualization step-by-step. Extensive experiments in the official story visualization dataset and our long story benchmark demonstrate that Story-Iter's state-of-the-art performance in long-story visualization (up to 100 frames) excels in both semantic consistency and fine-grained interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counting is a fundamental operation for various real-world visual tasks, requiring both object recognition and robust counting capabilities. Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervision and contrastive learning have brought the performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks. Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has received little attention. In this work, we delve into the behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaokun Sun, Zeyu Cai, Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While haircut indicates distinct personality, existing avatar generation methods fail to model practical hair due to the data limitation or entangled representation. We propose StrandHead, a novel text-driven method capable of generating 3D hair strands and disentangled head avatars with strand-level attributes. Instead of using large-scale hair-text paired data for supervision, we demonstrate that realistic hair strands can be generated from prompts by distilling 2D generative models pre-trained on human mesh data. To this end, we propose a meshing approach guided by strand geometry to guarantee the gradient flow from the distillation objective to the neural strand representation. The optimization is then regularized by statistically significant haircut features, leading to stable updating of strands against unreasonable drifting. These employed 2D/3D human-centric priors contribute to text-aligned and realistic 3D strand generation. Extensive experiments show that StrandHead achieves the state-of-the-art performance on text to strand generation and disentangled 3D head avatar modeling. The generated 3D hair can be applied on avatars for strand-level editing, as well as implemented in the graphics engine for physical simulation or other applications.

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel block for \emph{causal} video modelling. It relies on a time-space-channel factorisation with dedicated blocks for each dimension: gated linear recurrent units (LRUs) perform information mixing over time, self-attention layers perform mixing over space, and MLPs over channels. The resulting architecture \emph{TRecViT} is causal and shows strong performance on sparse and dense tasks, trained in supervised or self-supervised regimes, being the first causal video model in the state-space models family. Notably, our model outperforms or is on par with the popular (non-causal) ViViT-L model on large scale video datasets (SSv2, Kinetics400), while having $3\times$ less parameters, $12\times$ smaller memory footprint, and $5\times$ lower FLOPs count than the full self-attention ViViT, with an inference throughput of about 300 frames per second, running comfortably in real-time. When compared with causal transformer-based models (TSM, RViT) and other recurrent models like LSTM, TRecViT obtains state-of-the-art results on the challenging SSv2 dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Yang, Pai Peng, Wulin Xie, Xiaohuan Lu, Jie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains a critical challenge in the field of computer vision, particularly in data-scarce environments. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained visual-language models, such as CLIP. However, due to the modality gap, which is the inconsistent distribution of image and text features in the joint embedding space, directly using these features as class prototypes often leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Mapping (CMM) method. This method globally aligns image features with the text feature space through linear transformation and optimizes their local spatial relationships using triplet loss, thereby significantly enhancing cross-modal consistency. Experimental results show that compared to other methods, CMM simplifies the training process and demonstrates higher efficiency. Furthermore, CMM improves the average Top-1 accuracy by 1.06% on 11 benchmark datasets compared to methods that partially fine-tune the backbone, and it performs excellently on 4 distribution shift datasets. Notably, CMM effectively mitigates the modality gap in pre-trained models, enabling text features to serve as effective class prototypes for image features, thus providing an efficient and highly generalizable solution for few-shot learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Cui, Zhaoyi Li, Xiaochen Ma, Xinyue Bi, Yaxin Luo, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact yet representative dataset that preserves the essential characteristics of the original data for efficient model training. Existing methods mainly focus on improving data-synthetic alignment or scaling distillation to large datasets. In this work, we propose $\textbf{C}$ommittee $\textbf{V}$oting for $\textbf{D}$ataset $\textbf{D}$istillation ($\textbf{CV-DD}$), an orthogonal approach that leverages the collective knowledge of multiple models to produce higher-quality distilled data. We first establish a strong baseline that achieves state-of-the-art performance through modern architectural and optimization choices. By integrating distributions and predictions from multiple models and generating high-quality soft labels, our method captures a broader range of data characteristics, reduces model-specific bias and the impact of distribution shifts, and significantly improves generalization. This voting-based strategy enhances diversity and robustness, alleviates overfitting, and improves post-evaluation performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and IPC settings demonstrate that CV-DD consistently outperforms single- and multi-model distillation methods and generalizes well to non-training-based frameworks and challenging synthetic-to-real transfer tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsu-kuang Chiu, Ryo Hachiuma, Chien-Yi Wang, Stephen F. Smith, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Current autonomous driving vehicles rely mainly on their individual sensors to understand surrounding scenes and plan for future trajectories, which can be unreliable when the sensors are malfunctioning or occluded. To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multimodal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multimodal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released to the public to facilitate open-source research in this field. Our project website: https://eddyhkchiu.github.io/v2vllm.github.io/ .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Hu, Longguang Wang, Xian Liu, Ling-Hao Chen, Yuwei Guo, Yukai Shi, Ce Liu, Anyi Rao, Zeyu Wang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongshang Pang, Mayu Otani, Yuta Nakashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporally localizing user-queried events through natural language is a crucial capability for video models. Recent methods predominantly adapt video LLMs to generate event boundary timestamps for temporal localization tasks, which struggle to leverage LLMs' pre-trained semantic understanding capabilities due to the uninformative nature of timestamp outputs. In this work, we explore a timestamp-free, semantic-oriented framework that fine-tunes video LLMs using two generative learning tasks and one discriminative learning task. We first introduce a structural token generation task that enables the video LLM to recognize the temporal structure of input videos based on the input query. Through this task, the video LLM generates a sequence of special tokens, called structural tokens, which partition the video into consecutive segments and categorize them as either target events or background transitions. To enhance precise recognition of event segments, we further propose a query-focused captioning task that enables the video LLM to extract fine-grained event semantics that can be effectively utilized by the structural tokens. Finally, we introduce a structural token grounding module driven by contrastive learning to associate each structural token with its corresponding video segment, achieving holistic temporal segmentation of the input video and readily yielding the target event segments for localization. Extensive experiments across diverse temporal localization tasks demonstrate that our proposed framework, MeCo, consistently outperforms methods relying on boundary timestamp generation, highlighting the potential of a semantic-driven approach for temporal localization with video LLMs \footnote{Code available at https://github.com/pangzss/MeCo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haopeng Li, Jinyue Yang, Guoqi Li, Huan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutao Hu, Sen Li, Jincheng Yan, Wenqi Shao, Xiaoyan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) is a challenging but significant task in computer vision, which aims to recognize different sub-categories of birds, cars, airplanes, etc. Among them, recognizing models of different cars has significant application value in autonomous driving, traffic surveillance and scene understanding, which has received considerable attention in the past few years. However, Stanford-Car, the most widely used fine-grained dataset for car recognition, only has 196 different categories and only includes vehicle models produced earlier than 2013. Due to the rapid advancements in the automotive industry during recent years, the appearances of various car models have become increasingly intricate and sophisticated. Consequently, the previous Stanford-Car dataset fails to capture this evolving landscape and cannot satisfy the requirements of automotive industry. To address these challenges, in our paper, we introduce Car-1000, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for fine-grained visual categorization of diverse car models. Car-1000 encompasses vehicles from 166 different automakers, spanning a wide range of 1000 distinct car models. Additionally, we have reproduced several state-of-the-art FGVC methods on the Car-1000 dataset, establishing a new benchmark for research in this field. We hope that our work will offer a fresh perspective for future FGVC researchers. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/toggle1995/Car-1000.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generalization of learning-based high dynamic range (HDR) fusion is often limited by the availability of training data, as collecting large-scale HDR images from dynamic scenes is both costly and technically challenging. To address these challenges, we propose S2R-HDR, the first large-scale high-quality synthetic dataset for HDR fusion, with 24,000 HDR samples. Using Unreal Engine 5, we design a diverse set of realistic HDR scenes that encompass various dynamic elements, motion types, high dynamic range scenes, and lighting. Additionally, we develop an efficient rendering pipeline to generate realistic HDR images. To further mitigate the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, we introduce S2R-Adapter, a domain adaptation designed to bridge this gap and enhance the generalization ability of models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingjun Zhao, Sizhe Wei, James Hays, Lu Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is essential for achieving safe, reliable autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Although voxel-based scene representations are widely used for semantic occupancy prediction, 3D Gaussians have emerged as a continuous and significantly more compact alternative. In this work, we propose a multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D deformable attention, namely GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy that provides 3D Gaussians with accurate geometry priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention mechanism to refine these Gaussians using LiDAR-camera fusion features in a lifted 3D space. Extensive experiments on real-world on-road and off-road autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that GaussianFormer3D achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Huang, Tianle Hu, Yu Chen, Zi'ang Li, Jie Wen, Xiaozhao Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single image reflection separation aims to separate the transmission and reflection layers from a mixed image. Existing methods typically combine general priors from pre-trained models with task-specific priors such as text prompts and reflection detection. However, the transmission prior, as the most direct task-specific prior for the target transmission layer, has not been effectively modeled or fully utilized, limiting performance in complex scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prior interaction framework based on lightweight transmission prior generation and effective prior fusion. First, we design a Local Linear Correction Network (LLCN) that finetunes pre-trained models based on the physical constraint T=SI+B, where S and B represent pixel-wise and channel-wise scaling and bias transformations. LLCN efficiently generates high-quality transmission priors with minimal parameters. Second, we construct a Dual-Prior Interaction Transformer (DPIT) that employs a dual-stream channel reorganization attention mechanism. By reorganizing features from general and transmission priors for attention computation, DPIT achieves deep fusion of both priors, fully exploiting their complementary information. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zs\'ofia Moln\'ar, Gergely Szab\'o, Andr\'as Horv\'ath</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision models pretrained on large-scale RGB natural image datasets are widely reused for electron microscopy image segmentation. In electron microscopy, volumetric data are acquired as serial sections and processed as stacks of adjacent grayscale slices, where neighboring slices provide symmetric contextual information for identifying features on the central slice. The common strategy maps such stacks to pseudo-RGB inputs to enable transfer learning from pretrained models. However, this mapping imposes channel-specific semantics inherited from natural images, even though electron microscopy slices are homogeneous in the modality and symmetric in their predictive roles. As a result, pretrained models may encode inductive biases that are misaligned with the inherent symmetry of volumetric electron microscopy data. In this work, it is demonstrated that RGB-pretrained models systematically assign unequal importance to individual input slices when applied to stacked electron microscopy data, despite the absence of any intrinsic channel ordering. Using saliency-based attribution analysis across multiple architectures, a consistent channel-level asymmetry was observed that persists after fine-tuning and affects model interpretability, even when segmentation performance is unchanged. To address this issue, a targeted modification of pretraining weights based on uniform channel initialization was proposed, which restores symmetric feature attribution while preserving the benefits of pretraining. Experiments on the SNEMI, Lucchi and GF-PA66 datasets confirm a substantial reduction in attribution bias without compromising or even improving segmentation accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical. Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC). RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 11,396 unique Wikipedia documents curated and ranked by human annotators. Through the extensive evaluation on seven multimodal retrievers and fifteen VLMs, RAVENEA reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) In general, cultural grounding annotations can enhance multimodal retrieval and corresponding downstream tasks. (ii) VLMs, when augmented with culture-aware retrieval, generally outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by averaging +6% on cVQA and +11% on cIC). (iii) Performance of culture-aware retrieval augmented varies widely across countries. These findings highlight the limitations of current multimodal retrievers and VLMs, underscoring the need to enhance visual culture understanding within RAG systems. We believe RAVENEA offers a valuable resource for advancing research on retrieval-augmented visual culture understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for multimodal learning in Earth science offer limited, siloed coverage of Earth's spheres and their cross-sphere interactions, typically restricting evaluation to the human-activity sphere of atmosphere and to at most 16 tasks. These limitations: narrow-source heterogeneity (single/few data sources), constrained scientific granularity, and limited-sphere extensibility. Therefore, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark that systematically spans all six spheres: atmosphere, lithosphere, oceanosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and human-activity sphere, and cross-spheres. Built with a scalable, modular-topology data inference framework and native multi-observation sources and expert-in-the-loop curation, OmniEarth-Bench produces 29,855 standardized, expert-curated annotations. All annotations are organized into a four-level hierarchy (Sphere, Scenario, Ability, Task), encompassing 109 expert-curated evaluation tasks. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35% accuracy, revealing systematic gaps in Earth-system cognitive ability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingyu Wu, Kai Zhu, Yu Liu, Longxiang Tang, Jian Yang, Yansong Peng, Wei Zhai, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, this process is challenged by the bidirectional dependencies inherent in conventional image tokenizations, which creates a fundamental misalignment with the unidirectional nature of autoregressive models. To resolve this, we introduce AliTok, a novel Aligned Tokenizer that alters the dependency structure of the token sequence. AliTok employs a bidirectional encoder constrained by a causal decoder, a design that compels the encoder to produce a token sequence with both semantic richness and forward-dependency. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing a two-stage tokenizer training process to enhance reconstruction performance, AliTok achieves high fidelity and predictability simultaneously. Building upon AliTok, a standard decoder-only autoregressive model with just 177M parameters achieves a gFID of 1.44 and an IS of 319.5 on ImageNet-256. Scaling to 662M, our model reaches a gFID of 1.28, surpassing the SOTA diffusion method with 10x faster sampling. On ImageNet-512, our 318M model also achieves a SOTA gFID of 1.39.

<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible user-controllable summarization tools that operate without training data. Existing methods either rely on domain-specific datasets, limiting generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot, text-queryable video-summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large-language-models (LLMs) judging, without the use of training data, beating unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments video into scenes, (ii) produces scene descriptions with a memory-efficient batch prompting scheme that scales to hours on a single GPU, (iii) scores scene importance with an LLM via tailored prompts, and (iv) propagates scores to frames using new consistency (temporal coherence) and uniqueness (novelty) metrics for fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our approach surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods and performs competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization benchmark, where the competing methods require supervised frame-level importance. We release VidSum-Reason, a query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step reasoning, where our framework serves as the first challenging baseline. Overall, we demonstrate that pretrained multi-modal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score propagation, provide a powerful foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Tausani, Paolo Muratore, Morgan B. Talbot, Giacomo Amerio, Gabriel Kreiman, Davide Zoccolan</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncovering which feature combinations are encoded by visual units is critical to understanding how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is critical to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), a model-agnostic, gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's maximally invariant stimuli, and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter (stretch) the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation downstream (squeeze). To probe adversarial sensitivity, stretching and squeezing are reversed to maximally perturb unit activation while minimizing changes to the upstream representation. Applied to CNNs, SnS revealed invariant transformations that were farther from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed depending on the stage of the image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer representations mainly altered texture and pose. By measuring how well the hierarchical invariant images obtained for L2 robust networks were classified by humans and other observer networks, we discovered a substantial drop in their interpretability when the representation was stretched in deep layers, while the opposite trend was found for standard models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Yue Shi, Yanlin Zheng, Uazman Alam, Maryam Ferdousi, Rayaz Malik</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT) designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost. A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renyang Liu, Guanlin Li, Tianwei Zhang, See-Kiong Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lirong Zheng, Yanshan Li, Rui Yu, Kaihao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers offer strong global modeling for single-image dehazing but come with high computational costs. Most methods rely on spatial features to capture long-range dependencies, making them less effective under complex haze conditions. Although some integrate frequency-domain cues, weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits their performance. To address these issues, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a dual-domain framework that explicitly aligns degradation across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock consists of two key modules: 1) Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which uses dark channel priors to generate a haze confidence map for adaptive frequency modulation, achieving global degradation-aware spectral filtering. 2) Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features via multi-scale convolutions and a hybrid gating mechanism to recover fine-grained structures. Additionally, the Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates feedback for iterative refinement of the prior, improving haze localization accuracy, particularly in outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness and real-time efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Yang, Tianhong Li, Lijie Fan, Yonglong Tian, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective -- reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs, such as signals degraded by Gaussian noise or masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective, encouraging latent embeddings that remain reconstructable even under significant corruption. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok), a simple yet highly effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images from latent embeddings corrupted via interpolative noise or random masking. Extensive experiments on class-conditioned (ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512) and text-conditioned (MSCOCO) image generation benchmarks demonstrate that our l-DeTok consistently improves generation quality across six representative generative models compared to prior tokenizers. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new perspectives for future tokenizer design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shitian Yang, Deyu Li, Xiaoke Jiang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin augmentation toolbox, since many image transforms, including rotations and warps, disrupt geometric consistency. While horizontal flipping and color jitter are standard, rigorous 3D rotation augmentation has surprisingly remained absent from RGB-based pipelines, largely due to the misconception that it requires scene depth or scene reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry, achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We first validate 3DRot on a classical RGB-based 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D, inserting 3DRot into a frozen DINO-X + Cube R-CNN pipeline raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11; smaller but consistent gains appear on a cross-domain IN10 split. Beyond monocular detection, adding 3DRot on top of the standard BTS augmentation schedule further improves NYU Depth v2 from 0.1783 to 0.1685 in abs-rel (and 0.7472 to 0.7548 in $\delta<1.25$), and reduces cross-dataset error on SUN RGB-D. On KITTI, applying the same camera-centric rotations in MVX-Net (LiDAR+RGB) raises moderate 3D AP from about 63.85 to 65.16 while remaining compatible with standard 3D augmentations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artzai Picon, Itziar Eguskiza, Daniel Mugica, Javier Romero, Carlos Javier Jimenez, Eric White, Gabriel Do-Lago-Junqueira, Christian Klukas, Ramon Navarra-Mestre</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable plant species and damage segmentation for herbicide field research trials requires models that can withstand substantial real-world variation across seasons, geographies, devices, and sensing modalities. Most deep learning approaches trained on controlled datasets fail to generalize under these domain shifts, limiting their suitability for operational phenotyping pipelines. This study evaluates a segmentation framework that integrates vision foundation models (DINOv2) with hierarchical taxonomic inference to improve robustness across heterogeneous agricultural conditions. We train on a large, multi-year dataset collected in Germany and Spain (2018-2020), comprising 14 plant species and 4 herbicide damage classes, and assess generalization under increasingly challenging shifts: temporal and device changes (2023), geographic transfer to the United States, and extreme sensor shift to drone imagery (2024). Results show that the foundation-model backbone consistently outperforms prior baselines, improving species-level F1 from 0.52 to 0.87 on in-distribution data and maintaining significant advantages under moderate (0.77 vs. 0.24) and extreme (0.44 vs. 0.14) shift conditions. Hierarchical inference provides an additional layer of robustness, enabling meaningful predictions even when fine-grained species classification degrades (family F1: 0.68, class F1: 0.88 on aerial imagery). Error analysis reveals that failures under severe shift stem primarily from vegetation-soil confusion, suggesting that taxonomic distinctions remain preserved despite background and viewpoint variability. The system is now deployed within BASF's phenotyping workflow for herbicide research trials across multiple regions, illustrating the practical viability of combining foundation models with structured biological hierarchies for scalable, shift-resilient agricultural monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganxi Xu, Zhao-Rong Lai, Yuting Tang, Yonghao Song, Guoxu Zhou, Boyu wang, Jian Zhu, Jinyi Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present a novel image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging the diffusion transformer architecture enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) to achieve brain signal generation. To realize the goal of image-to-brain signal conversion, we use cross-attention mechanisms to align brain signal embeddings with CLIP image embeddings. Moreover, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate image captions, and concatenate the resulting CLIP text embeddings with CLIP image embeddings to form unified embeddings for cross-attention alignment, enabling our model to capture core semantic information. Moreover, to capture core semantic information, we use large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptive and semantically accurate captions for images. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable spatio-temporal position encoding that combines brain region embeddings with temporal embeddings to capture both spatial and temporal characteristics of brain signals. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minsang Kong, Myeongjun Kim, Sang Gu Kang, Hejiu Lu, Yupeng Zhong, Sang Hun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for safe and efficient navigation. While recent methods often rely on high-definition (HD) maps to provide structured environmental priors, such maps are costly to maintain, geographically limited, and unreliable in dynamic or unmapped scenarios. Directly leveraging raw sensor data in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) space offers greater flexibility, but BEV features are dense and unstructured, making agent-centric spatial reasoning challenging and computationally inefficient. To address this, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a map-free framework that employs deformable attention to adaptively aggregate task-relevant context from sparse locations in dense BEV features. We further introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module that predicts a small set of realistic goals, enabling fully end-to-end multimodal forecasting without heuristic post-processing. Extensive experiments show that BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based methods while providing greater robustness and flexibility without relying on pre-built maps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Carlesso, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data difficulty during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Gossard, Filip Radovic, Andreas Ziegler, Andreas Zell</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore, we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time sports analytics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane (CH4) or other trace gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent for MethaneSAT, a satellite mission launched in March 2024, to fill a significant data gap in terms of resolution, precision and swath between coarse-resolution global mappers and fine-scale point-source imagers of methane, and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. MethaneSAT delivers hyperspectral data at an intermediate spatial resolution (approx. 100 x 400, m), whereas MethaneAIR provides even finer resolution (approx. 25 m), enabling the development of highly detailed maps of concentrations that enable quantification of both the sources and rates of emissions. In this study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions. Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques-including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-with advanced deep learning architectures, namely U-Net and a Spectral Channel Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality: U-Net performs best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details...

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuning Sun, Jialang Lu, Xiang Chen, Jichao Wang, Dianjie Lu, Guijuan Zhang, Guangwei Gao, Zhuoran Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise. In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight, we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components. First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity. This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on publicly available benchmarks. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shuning0312/ICLR-DeLiVR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver \emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence, while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\! 300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM) vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanglin Ning, Ruzhao Chen, Penghong Wang, Xingtao Wang, Ruiqin Xiong, Xiaopeng Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Explicitly modeling room background depth as a geometric constraint has proven effective for panoramic depth estimation. However, reconstructing this background depth for regular enclosed regions in a complex indoor scene without external measurements remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose a pose-aware and geometry-constrained framework for panoramic depth estimation. Our framework first employs multiple task-specific decoders to jointly estimate room layout, camera pose, depth, and region segmentation from a input panoramic image. A pose-aware background depth resolving (PA-BDR) component uses tasks decoder's prediction to resolve the camera pose. Subsequently, the proposed PA-BDR component uses the camera pose to compute the background depth of regular enclosed regions and uses this background depth as a strong geometric prior. Based on the output of the region segmentation decoder, a fusion mask generation (FMG) component produces a fusion weight map to guide where and to what extent the geometry-constrained background depth should correct the depth decoder's prediction. Finally, an adaptive fusion component integrates this refined background depth with the initial depth prediction, guided by the fusion weight. Extensive experiments on Matterport3D, Structured3D, and Replica datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significantly superior performance compared to current open-source methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darya Baranouskaya, Andrea Cavallaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy. While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely, when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag types and quantity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yuji Wang, Qianli Ma, Huayu Chen, Jintao Zhang, Yogesh Balaji, Jianfei Chen, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although continuous-time consistency models (e.g., sCM, MeanFlow) are theoretically principled and empirically powerful for fast academic-scale diffusion, its applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and the limitations of evaluation benchmarks like FID. This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency to general application-level image and video diffusion models, and to make JVP-based distillation effective at large scale. We first develop a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering" nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM generally matches the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality metrics while mitigating mode collapse and offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/rcm.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training. Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide range of downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Tang, Peihao Gong, Kunyu Li, Kai Guo, Boyu Wang, Mao Ye, Jianwei Zhang, Xiatian Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes. This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Selch, Yufang Hou, M. Jehanzeb Mirza, Sivan Doveh, James Glass, Rogerio Feris, Wei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench (Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering and human verification, we curate 384 inconsistencies from 353 papers. Based on this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models (GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (27.8-53.9\%), underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Aerni, Joshua Swanson, Kristina Nikoli\'c, Florian Tram\`er</p>
<p>Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks, as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jusheng Zhang, Kaitong Cai, Jing Yang, Jian Wang, Chengpei Tang, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.70 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal was unlikely contributed by demographic features by our machine learning study combining age, race, and sex labels to predict health insurance types; it also remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenliang Guo, Yujiang Pu, Yu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Mistake detection in procedural tasks is essential for building intelligent systems that support learning and task execution. Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhigyan Bhattacharya, Hiranmoy Roy, Debotosh Bhattacharjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Image inpainting aim is to restore the missing or corrupted regions in face images while preserving identity, structural consistency and photorealistic image quality, a task specifically created for photo restoration. Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training. Experiment on two datasets CelebA-HQ and FFHQ shows that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM. It produces visually striking results with better semantic preservation, in challenging large-area inpainting situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhang, Junhan Luo, Yugang Cao, Jie Huang,  Liangjian-Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Pansharpening fuses a high-resolution PAN image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to produce an HRMS image. A key difficulty is that jointly processing PAN and MS often entangles spatial detail with spectral fidelity. We propose S2WMamba, which explicitly disentangles frequency information and then performs lightweight cross-modal interaction. Concretely, a 2D Haar DWT is applied to PAN to localize spatial edges and textures, while a channel-wise 1D Haar DWT treats each pixel's spectrum as a 1D signal to separate low/high-frequency components and limit spectral distortion. The resulting Spectral branch injects wavelet-extracted spatial details into MS features, and the Spatial branch refines PAN features using spectra from the 1D pyramid; the two branches exchange information through Mamba-based cross-modulation that models long-range dependencies with linear complexity. A multi-scale dynamic gate (multiplicative + additive) then adaptively fuses branch outputs.On WV3, GF2, and QB, S2WMamba matches or surpasses recent strong baselines (FusionMamba, CANNet, U2Net, ARConv), improving PSNR by up to 0.23 dB and reaching HQNR 0.956 on full-resolution WV3. Ablations justify the choice of 2D/1D DWT placement, parallel dual branches, and the fusion gate. Our code is available at https://github.com/KagUYa66/S2WMamba.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image dehazing is crucial for reliable visual perception, yet it remains highly challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Rui Yin, Yifan Chen, Qi Chen, Chao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\Delta$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $\Delta$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobo Jiang, Jin Xie, Jian Yang, Liang Yu, Jianmin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel 3D registration paradigm, Generative Point Cloud Registration, which bridges advanced 2D generative models with 3D matching tasks to enhance registration performance. Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To this end, we introduce DepthMatch-ControlNet and LiDARMatch-ControlNet, two matching-specific, controllable 2D generative models. Specifically, for depth camera-based 3D registration with point clouds derived from the depth maps, DepthMatch-ControlNet leverages the depth-conditioned generation capabilities of ControlNet to synthesize perspective-view RGB images that are geometrically consistent with depth maps, ensuring accurate 2D-3D alignment. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, it further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. To address LiDAR-based 3D registration with point clouds captured by LiDAR sensors, LiDARMatch-ControlNet extends this framework by conditioning on paired equirectangular range maps projected from 360-degree LiDAR point clouds, generating corresponding panoramic RGB images. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing registration methods to improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the 3DMatch and ScanNet datasets (for depth-camera settings), as well as the Dur360BEV dataset (for LiDAR settings), demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongjun Park, Sunwook Hwang, Hyeonho Noh, Jin Mo Yang, Hyun Jong Yang, Saewoong Bahk</p>
<p>Abstract: Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.
  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.</p>

We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daichi Arai, Kyohei Unno, Yasuko Sugito, Yuichi Kusakabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinquan Yang, Jinheng Xie, Yawen Huang, Yuexiang Li, Huimin Huang, Hao Zheng, Xian Wu, Yefeng Zheng, Linlin Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaokun Sun, Zeyu Cai, Hao Tang, Ying Tai, Jian Yang, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06793">CliffordNet: All You Need is Geometric Algebra</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongping Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern computer vision architectures, from CNNs to Transformers, predominantly rely on the stacking of heuristic modules: spatial mixers (Attention/Conv) followed by channel mixers (FFNs). In this work, we challenge this paradigm by returning to mathematical first principles. We propose the Clifford Algebra Network (CAN), also referred to as CliffordNet, a vision backbone grounded purely in Geometric Algebra. Instead of engineering separate modules for mixing and memory, we derive a unified interaction mechanism based on the Clifford Geometric Product ($uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$). This operation ensures algebraic completeness regarding the Geometric Product by simultaneously capturing feature coherence (via the generalized inner product) and structural variation (via the exterior wedge product).
  Implemented via an efficient sparse rolling mechanism with strict linear complexity $O(N)$, our model reveals a surprising emergent property: the geometric interaction is so representationally dense that standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) become redundant. Empirically, CliffordNet establishes a new Pareto frontier: our Nano variant achieves 77.82\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 with only 1.4M parameters, effectively matching the heavy-weight ResNet-18 (11.2M) with $8\times$ fewer parameters, while our Lite variant (2.6M) sets a new SOTA for tiny models at 79.05\%. Our results suggest that global understanding can emerge solely from rigorous, algebraically complete local interactions, potentially signaling a shift where geometry is all you need.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang-Che Sun, Cheng Sun, Chin-Yang Lin, Fu-En Yang, Min-Hung Chen, Yen-Yu Lin, Yu-Lun Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanqi Zhan, Changye Li, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Yi Wu, Song Han, Ligeng Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding is an essential capability of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to understand the real physical world. Previous state-of-the-art grounding visual language models usually have large model sizes, making them heavy for deployment and slow for inference. However, we notice that the sizes of visual encoders are nearly the same for small and large VLMs and the major difference is the sizes of the language models. Small VLMs fall behind larger VLMs in grounding because of the difference in language understanding capability rather than visual information handling. To mitigate the gap, we introduce 'Efficient visual Grounding language Models' (EGM): a method to scale the test-time computation (#generated tokens). Scaling the test-time computation of a small model is deployment-friendly, and yields better end-to-end latency as the cost of each token is much cheaper compared to directly running a large model. On the RefCOCO benchmark, our EGM-Qwen3-VL-8B demonstrates 91.4 IoU with an average of 737ms (5.9x faster) latency while Qwen3-VL-235B demands 4,320ms to achieve 90.5 IoU. To validate our approach's generality, we further set up a new amodal grounding setting that requires the model to predict both the visible and occluded parts of the objects. Experiments show our method can consistently and significantly improve the vanilla grounding and amodal grounding capabilities of small models to be on par with or outperform the larger models, thereby improving the efficiency for visual grounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabi Nahian Madhurja, Rusab Sarmun, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury, Adam Mushtak, Israa Al-Hashimi, Sohaib Bassam Zoghoul</p>
<p>Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shadow removal under diverse lighting conditions requires disentangling illumination from intrinsic reflectance, a challenge compounded when physical priors are not properly aligned. We propose PhaSR (Physically Aligned Shadow Removal), addressing this through dual-level prior alignment to enable robust performance from single-light shadows to multi-source ambient lighting. First, Physically Aligned Normalization (PAN) performs closed-form illumination correction via Gray-world normalization, log-domain Retinex decomposition, and dynamic range recombination, suppressing chromatic bias. Second, Geometric-Semantic Rectification Attention (GSRA) extends differential attention to cross-modal alignment, harmonizing depth-derived geometry with DINO-v2 semantic embeddings to resolve modal conflicts under varying illumination. Experiments show competitive performance in shadow removal with lower complexity and generalization to ambient lighting where traditional methods fail under multi-source illumination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Liu, Boyu Diao, Zijia An, Runjie Shao, Zhulin An, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wulin Xie, Rui Dai, Ruidong Ding, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu, Xinwen Hou, Jie Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) predicts perceptual quality scores consistent with human judgments. Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Cui, Wenqiang Li, Shuai Zhou, Ruifeng Qin, Feng Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixue Fang, Xu He, Songlin Tang, Haoxian Zhang, Qingfeng Li, Xiaoqiang Liu, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on Multilevel Correlation Pyramidal Optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Rashid, Elvio G. Amparore, Enrico Ferrari, Damiano Verda</p>
<p>Abstract: Pixel-level feature attributions are an important tool in eXplainable AI for Computer Vision (XCV), providing visual insights into how image features influence model predictions. The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.
  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.
  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.</p>

Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanting Ye, Qiyan Zhao, Wenhao Yu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Jianmin Ji, Yanyong Zhang, Ka-Veng Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Fatehi, David Unnersj\"o-Jess, Linus Butt, No\'emie Moreau, Thomas Benzing, Katarzyna Bozek</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Automated podocyte foot process quantification is vital for kidney research, but the established "Automatic Morphological Analysis of Podocytes" (AMAP) method is hindered by high computational demands, a lack of a user interface, and Linux dependency. We developed AMAP-APP, a cross-platform desktop application designed to overcome these barriers.
  Methods: AMAP-APP optimizes efficiency by replacing intensive instance segmentation with classic image processing while retaining the original semantic segmentation model. It introduces a refined Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm to improve precision. Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).
  Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware. Morphometric outputs (area, perimeter, circularity, and slit diaphragm density) showed high correlation (r>0.90) and statistical equivalence (TOST P<0.05) to the original method. Additionally, the new ROI algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the original, showing reduced deviation from manual delineations.
  Conclusion: AMAP-APP democratizes deep learning-based podocyte morphometry. By eliminating the need for high-performance computing clusters and providing a user-friendly interface for Windows, macOS, and Linux, it enables widespread adoption in nephrology research and potential clinical diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgeney Bogatyrev, Khaled Abud, Ivan Molodetskikh, Nikita Alutis, Dmitriy Vatolin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lai Wei, Liangbo He, Jun Lan, Lingzhong Dong, Yutong Cai, Siyuan Li, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Linghe Kong, Yue Wang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Weiran Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziteng Lu, Yushuang Wu, Chongjie Ye, Yuda Qiu, Jing Shao, Xiaoyang Guo, Jiaqing Zhou, Tianlei Hu, Kun Zhou, Xiaoguang Han</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12916">Reliable Thinking with Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobin Li, Yutong Yang, Yijie Lin, Xiang Dai, Mouxing Yang, Xi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: As a multimodal extension of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Thinking with Images (TWI) has recently emerged as a promising avenue to enhance the reasoning capability of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which generates interleaved CoT by incorporating visual cues into the textual reasoning process. However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Data Assimilation (DA) is expanding rapidly. However, the absence of an objective, comprehensive, and real-world benchmark hinders the fair comparison of diverse methods. Here, we introduce DABench, a benchmark designed for contributing to the development and evaluation of AI-based DA methods. By integrating real-world observations, DABench provides an objective and fair platform for validating long-term closed-loop DA cycles, supporting both deterministic and ensemble configurations. Furthermore, we assess the efficacy of AI-based DA in generating initial conditions for the advanced AI-based weather forecasting model to produce accurate medium-range global weather forecasting. Our dual-validation, utilizing both reanalysis data and independent radiosonde observations, demonstrates that AI-based DA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art AI-driven four-dimensional variational frameworks across both global weather DA and medium-range forecasting metrics. We invite the research community to utilize DABench to accelerate the advancement of AI-based DA for global weather forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a \textbf{one-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only consistent speed-up on LLM pretraining, but also image classification, with minimum extra tuning on hyperparameters.

<p>Abstract: Audio and music generation based on flexible multimodal control signals is a widely applicable topic, with the following key challenges: 1) a unified multimodal modeling framework, and 2) large-scale, high-quality training data. As such, we propose AudioX, a unified framework for anything-to-audio generation that integrates varied multimodal conditions (i.e., text, video, and audio signals) in this work. The core design in this framework is a Multimodal Adaptive Fusion module, which enables the effective fusion of diverse multimodal inputs, enhancing cross-modal alignment and improving overall generation quality. To train this unified model, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, IF-caps, comprising over 7 million samples curated through a structured data annotation pipeline. This dataset provides comprehensive supervision for multimodal-conditioned audio generation. We benchmark AudioX against state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of tasks, finding that our model achieves superior performance, especially in text-to-audio and text-to-music generation. These results demonstrate our method is capable of audio generation under multimodal control signals, showing powerful instruction-following potential.

<p>Abstract: Learning effective visual representations for robotic manipulation remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex body dynamics involved in action execution. In this paper, we study how visual representations that carry body-relevant cues can enable efficient policy learning for downstream robotic manipulation tasks. We present $\textbf{I}$nter-token $\textbf{Con}$trast ($\textbf{ICon}$), a contrastive learning method applied to the token-level representations of Vision Transformers (ViTs). ICon enforces a separation in the feature space between agent-specific and environment-specific tokens, resulting in agent-centric visual representations that embed body-specific inductive biases. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into end-to-end policy learning by incorporating the contrastive loss as an auxiliary objective. Our experiments show that ICon not only improves policy performance across various manipulation tasks but also facilitates policy transfer across different robots.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Meyer, Josef Gr\"un, Maximilian Weiherer, Bernhard Egger, Marc Stamminger, Linus Franke</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).</p>

<p>Abstract: Rare diseases affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains an urgent challenge. Patients often endure a prolonged diagnostic odyssey exceeding five years, marked by repeated referrals, misdiagnoses, and unnecessary interventions, leading to delayed treatment and substantial emotional and economic burdens. Here we present DeepRare, a multi-agent system for rare disease differential diagnosis decision support powered by large language models, integrating over 40 specialized tools and up-to-date knowledge sources. DeepRare processes heterogeneous clinical inputs, including free-text descriptions, structured Human Phenotype Ontology terms, and genetic testing results, to generate ranked diagnostic hypotheses with transparent reasoning linked to verifiable medical evidence. Evaluated across nine datasets from literature, case reports and clinical centres across Asia, North America and Europe spanning 14 medical specialties, DeepRare demonstrates exceptional performance on 3,134 diseases. In human-phenotype-ontology-based tasks, it achieves an average Recall@1 of 57.18%, outperforming the next-best method by 23.79%; in multi-modal tests, it reaches 69.1% compared with Exomiser's 55.9% on 168 cases. Expert review achieved 95.4% agreement on its reasoning chains, confirming their validity and traceability. Our work not only advances rare disease diagnosis but also demonstrates how the latest powerful large-language-model-driven agentic systems can reshape current clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglun Kong, Mufan Qiu, John Boesen, Xiang Lin, Sukwon Yun, Tianlong Chen, Manolis Kellis, Marinka Zitnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial context jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but existing methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem by introducing SPATIA, a multi-level generative and predictive model that learns unified, spatially aware representations by fusing morphology, gene expression, and spatial context from the cell to the tissue level. SPATIA also incorporates a novel spatially conditioned generative framework for predicting cell morphologies under perturbations. Specifically, we propose a confidence-aware flow matching objective that reweights weak optimal-transport pairs based on uncertainty. We further apply morphology-profile alignment to encourage biologically meaningful image generation, enabling the modeling of microenvironment-dependent phenotypic transitions. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 25.9 million cell-gene pairs across 17 tissues. We benchmark SPATIA against 18 models across 12 tasks, spanning categories such as phenotype generation, annotation, clustering, gene imputation, and cross-modal prediction. SPATIA achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art models, improving generative fidelity by 8% and predictive accuracy by up to 3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojie Li, Chu Li, Shi-Zhe Chen, Xi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL (Universal MultimodAl RetrieVal via Embedding Learning), which outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings, and also exhibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based retrieval tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chaxjli/U-MARVEL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Jui Huang, Mohammad Amin Mirzaee, Michael Kaess, Wenzhen Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving interaction with objects in hand.

<p>Abstract: 4D live fluorescence microscopy is often compromised by prolonged high intensity illumination which induces photobleaching and phototoxic effects that generate photo-induced artifacts and severely impair image continuity and detail recovery. To address this challenge, we propose the CellINR framework, a case-specific optimization approach based on implicit neural representation. The method employs blind convolution and structure amplification strategies to map 3D spatial coordinates into the high frequency domain, enabling precise modeling and high-accuracy reconstruction of cellular structures while effectively distinguishing true signals from artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that CellINR significantly outperforms existing techniques in artifact removal and restoration of structural continuity, and for the first time, a paired 4D live cell imaging dataset is provided for evaluating reconstruction performance, thereby offering a solid foundation for subsequent quantitative analyses and biological research. The code and dataset will be public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Huayu Chen, Haotian Ye, Haoxiang Wang, Qinsheng Zhang, Kai Jiang, Hang Su, Stefano Ermon, Jun Zhu, Ming-Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Onurcan Kaya, Desmond Elliott, Dim P. Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Afzal, S. Akshay, Blaise Genest, Ashutosh Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on robustness of neural networks, i.e., checking if the decision remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, most of these approaches ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this work, we aim to develop a generalized framework for formally reasoning about the confidence along with robustness in neural networks. We propose a simple yet expressive grammar that captures various confidence-based specifications. We develop a novel and unified technique to verify all instances of the grammar in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network, which enables the use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks, where the largest network has 138M parameters, and show that this outperforms ad-hoc encoding approaches by a significant margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Niu, Jiashuai She, Taotao Cai, Yajuan Zhang, Ping Zhang, Junhua Gu, Jianxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground-based cloud image segmentation is a critical research domain for photovoltaic power forecasting. Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/CSRC.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15829">Emergent human-like working memory from artificial neurons with intrinsic plasticity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingli Liu, Huannan Zheng, Bohao Zou, Kezhou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahadev Sunil Kumar, Arnab Raha, Debayan Das, Gopakumar G, Rounak Chatterjee, Amitava Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have become central to modern computer vision, yet their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains hindered by substantial parameter counts, computational demands, and the probability of device failure. Here, we present an approach to the efficient deployment of distributed DNNs that jointly respect hardware limitations, preserve task performance, and remain robust to partial system failures. Our method integrates structured model pruning with a multi-objective optimization framework to tailor network capacity for heterogeneous device constraints, while explicitly accounting for device availability and failure probability during deployment. We demonstrate this framework using Multi-View Convolutional Neural Networks (MVCNN), a state-of-the-art architecture for 3D object recognition, by quantifying the contribution of individual views to classification accuracy and allocating pruning budgets accordingly. Experimental results show that the resulting models satisfy user-specified bounds on accuracy and memory footprint, even under multiple simultaneous device failures. The inference time is reduced by factors up to 4.7x across diverse simulated device configurations. These findings suggest that performance-aware, view-adaptive, and failure-resilient compression provides a viable pathway for deploying complex vision models in distributed edge environments.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03983">Efficient Long-Horizon Vision-Language-Action Models via Static-Dynamic Disentanglement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Qiu, Tinglin Huang, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: While humans perceive the world through diverse modalities that operate synergistically to support a holistic understanding of their surroundings, existing omnivideo models still face substantial challenges on audio-visual understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning. OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwen Sun, Wenyao Zhang, Zekun Qi, Shaojie Ren, Zezhi Liu, Hanxin Zhu, Guangzhong Sun, Xin Jin, Zhibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11554">HyperDet: 3D Object Detection with Hyper 4D Radar Point Clouds</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichun Xiao, Runwei Guan, Fangqiang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungyeon Yoo, Youngseok Jang, Dabin Kim, Youngsoo Han, Seungwoo Jung, H. Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate these challenges, prior GS-based works have considered only static scenes or non-photorealistic human obstacles built from simulator assets, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios in target environments by augmenting a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains navigation policies using the generated datasets. The pipeline provides three key contributions: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates static scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) a navigation dataset generation framework that leverages the simulator along with a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations and a human planner, and (3) robust navigation policies to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The proposed simulator generates thousands of photorealistic navigation scenarios with animatable human GS avatars from arbitrary viewpoints. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.</p>
