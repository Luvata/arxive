<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuting Zhao, Chenkang Du, Kristin Qi, Xinrong Chen, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptation methods are developed to adapt depth foundation models to endoscopic depth estimation recently. However, such approaches typically under-perform training since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics. Therefore, we propose a full-parameter and parameter-efficient learning framework for endoscopic depth estimation. At the first stage, the subspace of attention, convolution and multi-layer perception are adapted simultaneously within different sub-spaces. At the second stage, a memory-efficient optimization is proposed for subspace composition and the performance is further improved in the united sub-space. Initial experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate that results at the first stage improves the performance from 10.2% to 4.1% for Sq Rel, Abs Rel, RMSE and RMSE log in the comparison with the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Shi, Boyu Jiang, Feng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately identifying, understanding, and describing driving safety-critical events (SCEs), including crashes and near-crashes, is crucial for traffic safety, automated driving systems, and advanced driver assistance systems research and application. As SCEs are rare events, most general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have not been trained sufficiently to link SCE videos and narratives, which could lead to hallucination and missing key safety characteristics. To tackle these challenges, we propose ScVLM, a hybrid approach that combines supervised learning and contrastive learning to improve driving video understanding and event description rationality for VLMs. The proposed approach is trained on and evaluated by more than 8,600 SCEs from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study dataset, the largest publicly accessible driving dataset with videos and SCE annotations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in generating contextually accurate event descriptions and mitigate hallucinations from VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Yang, Xukun Wang, Wentao Wang, Guoming Li, Qihang Fang, Ruihong Yuan, Tianyang Wang, Jason Zhaoxin Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is a pivotal area within film-making and Virtual Reality. Although existing methods have made significant strides following the end-to-end paradigm, they still encounter challenges in producing videos with high-frequency details due to their limited expressivity in this domain. This limitation has prompted us to explore an effective post-processing approach to synthesize photo-realistic talking head videos. Specifically, we employ a pretrained Wav2Lip model as our foundation model, leveraging its robust audio-lip alignment capabilities. Drawing on the theory of Lipschitz Continuity, we have theoretically established the noise robustness of Vector Quantised Auto Encoders (VQAEs). Our experiments further demonstrate that the high-frequency texture deficiency of the foundation model can be temporally consistently recovered by the Space-Optimised Vector Quantised Auto Encoder (SOVQAE) we introduced, thereby facilitating the creation of realistic talking head videos. We conduct experiments on both the conventional dataset and the High-Frequency TalKing head (HFTK) dataset that we curated. The results indicate that our method, LaDTalk, achieves new state-of-the-art video quality and out-of-domain lip synchronization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Hamza Sharif, Muzammal Naseer, Mohammad Yaqub, Min Xu, Mohsen Guizani</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent attention-based volumetric segmentation (VS) methods have achieved remarkable performance in the medical domain which focuses on modeling long-range dependencies. However, for voxel-wise prediction tasks, discriminative local features are key components for the performance of the VS models which is missing in attention-based VS methods. Aiming at resolving this issue, we deliberately incorporate the convolutional encoder branch with transformer backbone to extract local and global features in a parallel manner and aggregate them in Cross Feature Mixer Module (CFMM) for better prediction of segmentation mask. Consequently, we observe that the derived model, Y-CT-Net, achieves competitive performance on multiple medical segmentation tasks. For example, on multi-organ segmentation, Y-CT-Net achieves an 82.4% dice score, surpassing well-tuned VS Transformer/CNN-like baselines UNETR/ResNet-3D by 2.9%/1.4%. With the success of Y-CT-Net, we extend this concept with hybrid attention models, that derived Y-CH-Net model, which brings a 3% improvement in terms of HD95 score for same segmentation task. The effectiveness of both models Y-CT-Net and Y-CH-Net verifies our hypothesis and motivates us to initiate the concept of Y-CA-Net, a versatile generic architecture based upon any two encoders and a decoder backbones, to fully exploit the complementary strengths of both convolution and attention mechanisms. Based on experimental results, we argue Y-CA-Net is a key player in achieving superior results for volumetric segmentation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01020">A Critical Assessment of Visual Sound Source Localization Models Including Negative Audio</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xavier Juanola, Gloria Haro, Magdalena Fuentes</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of Visual Sound Source Localization (VSSL) involves identifying the location of sound sources in visual scenes, integrating audio-visual data for enhanced scene understanding. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we observe three critical flaws: i) The evaluation of the models is mainly focused in sounds produced by objects that are visible in the image, ii) The evaluation often assumes a prior knowledge of the size of the sounding object, and iii) No universal threshold for localization in real-world scenarios is established, as previous approaches only consider positive examples without accounting for both positive and negative cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwan Chung, Seungwon Lim, Jaehyun Jeon, Seungbeen Lee, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans possess multimodal literacy, allowing them to actively integrate information from various modalities to form reasoning. Faced with challenges like lexical ambiguity in text, we supplement this with other modalities, such as thumbnail images or textbook illustrations. Is it possible for machines to achieve a similar multimodal understanding capability? In response, we present Understanding Pun with Image Explanations (UNPIE), a novel benchmark designed to assess the impact of multimodal inputs in resolving lexical ambiguities. Puns serve as the ideal subject for this evaluation due to their intrinsic ambiguity. Our dataset includes 1,000 puns, each accompanied by an image that explains both meanings. We pose three multimodal challenges with the annotations to assess different aspects of multimodal literacy; Pun Grounding, Disambiguation, and Reconstruction. The results indicate that various Socratic Models and Visual-Language Models improve over the text-only models when given visual context, particularly as the complexity of the tasks increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui-Yang Ju, Chun-Tse Chien, Enkaer Xieerke, Jen-Shiun Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Children often suffer wrist trauma in daily life, while they usually need radiologists to analyze and interpret X-ray images before surgical treatment by surgeons. The development of deep learning has enabled neural networks to serve as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) tools to help doctors and experts in medical image diagnostics. Since the You Only Look Once Version-8 (YOLOv8) model has obtained the satisfactory success in object detection tasks, it has been applied to various fracture detection. This work introduces four variants of Feature Contexts Excitation-YOLOv8 (FCE-YOLOv8) model, each incorporating a different FCE module (i.e., modules of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE), Global Context (GC), Gather-Excite (GE), and Gaussian Context Transformer (GCT)) to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate that our proposed YOLOv8+GC-M3 model improves the mAP@50 value from 65.78% to 66.32%, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model while reducing inference time. Furthermore, our proposed YOLOv8+SE-M3 model achieves the highest mAP@50 value of 67.07%, exceeding the SOTA performance.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01055">ARPOV: Expanding Visualization of Object Detection in AR with Panoramic Mosaic Stitching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Erin McGowan, Ethan Brewer, Claudio Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: As the uses of augmented reality (AR) become more complex and widely available, AR applications will increasingly incorporate intelligent features that require developers to understand the user's behavior and surrounding environment (e.g. an intelligent assistant). Such applications rely on video captured by an AR headset, which often contains disjointed camera movement with a limited field of view that cannot capture the full scope of what the user sees at any given time. Moreover, standard methods of visualizing object detection model outputs are limited to capturing objects within a single frame and timestep, and therefore fail to capture the temporal and spatial context that is often necessary for various domain applications. We propose ARPOV, an interactive visual analytics tool for analyzing object detection model outputs tailored to video captured by an AR headset that maximizes user understanding of model performance. The proposed tool leverages panorama stitching to expand the view of the environment while automatically filtering undesirable frames, and includes interactive features that facilitate object detection model debugging. ARPOV was designed as part of a collaboration between visualization researchers and machine learning and AR experts; we validate our design choices through interviews with 5 domain experts.</p>

Our computational workflow leverages recent advances in foundation models for segmentation and a vision transformer-based approach to estimate the point cloud which defines the geometry of the barrel.

We train BarrelNet using synthetically generated barrel point clouds, and qualitatively demonstrate the potential of our approach using remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video footage of barrels found at a historic dump site. We compare our method to a traditional least squares fitting approach and show significant improvement according to our defined benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiao-An Yang, Ziwei Liu, Raymond A. Yeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Subsampling layers play a crucial role in deep nets by discarding a portion of an activation map to reduce its spatial dimensions. This encourages the deep net to learn higher-level representations. Contrary to this motivation, we hypothesize that the discarded activations are useful and can be incorporated on the fly to improve models' prediction. To validate our hypothesis, we propose a search and aggregate method to find useful activation maps to be used at test time. We applied our approach to the task of image classification and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments over nine different architectures on multiple datasets show that our method consistently improves model test-time performance, complementing existing test-time augmentation techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiran Wu, Che Liu, Canyu Chen, Jun Li, Cosmin I. Bercea, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved medical task performance, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Report Generation (RG). However, the fairness of these models across diverse demographic groups remains underexplored, despite its importance in healthcare. This oversight is partly due to the lack of demographic diversity in existing medical multimodal datasets, which complicates the evaluation of fairness. In response, we propose FMBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the fairness of MLLMs performance across diverse demographic attributes. FMBench has the following key features: 1: It includes four demographic attributes: race, ethnicity, language, and gender, across two tasks, VQA and RG, under zero-shot settings. 2: Our VQA task is free-form, enhancing real-world applicability and mitigating the biases associated with predefined choices. 3: We utilize both lexical metrics and LLM-based metrics, aligned with clinical evaluations, to assess models not only for linguistic accuracy but also from a clinical perspective. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric, Fairness-Aware Performance (FAP), to evaluate how fairly MLLMs perform across various demographic attributes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance and fairness of eight state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs, including both general and medical MLLMs, ranging from 7B to 26B parameters on the proposed benchmark. We aim for FMBench to assist the research community in refining model evaluation and driving future advancements in the field. All data and code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vlatko Spasev, Ivica Dimitrovski, Ivan Chorbev, Ivan Kitanovski</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as remote sensing platforms has garnered considerable attention, proving invaluable for ground object recognition. While satellite remote sensing images face limitations in resolution and weather susceptibility, UAV remote sensing, employing low-speed unmanned aircraft, offers enhanced object resolution and agility. The advent of advanced machine learning techniques has propelled significant strides in image analysis, particularly in semantic segmentation for UAV remote sensing images. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of SegFormer, a semantic segmentation framework, for the semantic segmentation of UAV images. SegFormer variants, ranging from real-time (B0) to high-performance (B5) models, are assessed using the UAVid dataset tailored for semantic segmentation tasks. The research details the architecture and training procedures specific to SegFormer in the context of UAV semantic segmentation. Experimental results showcase the model's performance on benchmark dataset, highlighting its ability to accurately delineate objects and land cover features in diverse UAV scenarios, leading to both high efficiency and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) aims to perform the limited annotated data learning in the medical image analysis scope. Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on three scenarios (i.e., cross-modal, cross-sequence and cross-institution), which includes eight medical datasets and involves three body regions, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves the SoTA performance against the compared models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siavash H. Khajavi, Mehdi Moshtaghi, Dikai Yu, Zixuan Liu, Kary Fr\"amling, Jan Holmstr\"om</p>
<p>Abstract: The fuzzy object detection is a challenging field of research in computer vision (CV). Distinguishing between fuzzy and non-fuzzy object detection in CV is important. Fuzzy objects such as fire, smoke, mist, and steam present significantly greater complexities in terms of visual features, blurred edges, varying shapes, opacity, and volume compared to non-fuzzy objects such as trees and cars. Collection of a balanced and diverse dataset and accurate annotation is crucial to achieve better ML models for fuzzy objects, however, the task of collection and annotation is still highly manual. In this research, we propose and leverage an alternative method of generating and automatically annotating fully synthetic fire images based on 3D models for training an object detection model. Moreover, the performance, and efficiency of the trained ML models on synthetic images is compared with ML models trained on real imagery and mixed imagery. Findings proved the effectiveness of the synthetic data for fire detection, while the performance improves as the test dataset covers a broader spectrum of real fires. Our findings illustrates that when synthetic imagery and real imagery is utilized in a mixed training set the resulting ML model outperforms models trained on real imagery as well as models trained on synthetic imagery for detection of a broad spectrum of fires. The proposed method for automating the annotation of synthetic fuzzy objects imagery carries substantial implications for reducing both time and cost in creating computer vision models specifically tailored for detecting fuzzy objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Michael Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become popular in computer vision tasks. Backdoor attacks, which trigger undesirable behaviours in models during inference, threaten ViTs' performance, particularly in security-sensitive tasks. Although backdoor defences have been developed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they are less effective for ViTs, and defences tailored to ViTs are scarce. To address this, we present Interleaved Ensemble Unlearning (IEU), a method for finetuning clean ViTs on backdoored datasets. In stage 1, a shallow ViT is finetuned to have high confidence on backdoored data and low confidence on clean data. In stage 2, the shallow ViT acts as a ``gate'' to block potentially poisoned data from the defended ViT. This data is added to an unlearn set and asynchronously unlearned via gradient ascent. We demonstrate IEU's effectiveness on three datasets against 11 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and show its versatility by applying it to different model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Yang, Yuxin Hu, Mao Ye, Zaiwei Zhang, Zhichao Lu, Yi Xu, Ufuk Topcu, Ben Snyder</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal foundation models offer promising advancements for enhancing driving perception systems, but their high computational and financial costs pose challenges. We develop a method that leverages foundation models to refine predictions from existing driving perception models -- such as enhancing object classification accuracy -- while minimizing the frequency of using these resource-intensive models. The method quantitatively characterizes uncertainties in the perception model's predictions and engages the foundation model only when these uncertainties exceed a pre-specified threshold. Specifically, it characterizes uncertainty by calibrating the perception model's confidence scores into theoretical lower bounds on the probability of correct predictions using conformal prediction. Then, it sends images to the foundation model and queries for refining the predictions only if the theoretical bound of the perception model's outcome is below the threshold. Additionally, we propose a temporal inference mechanism that enhances prediction accuracy by integrating historical predictions, leading to tighter theoretical bounds. The method demonstrates a 10 to 15 percent improvement in prediction accuracy and reduces the number of queries to the foundation model by 50 percent, based on quantitative evaluations from driving datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyang Li, Juming Xiong, Ruining Deng, Tianyuan Yao, Regina N Tyree, Girish Hiremath, Yuankai Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Endoscopy is a crucial tool for diagnosing the gastrointestinal tract, but its effectiveness is often limited by a narrow field of view and the dynamic nature of the internal environment, especially in the esophagus, where complex and repetitive patterns make image stitching challenging. This paper introduces a novel automatic image unfolding and stitching framework tailored for esophageal videos captured during endoscopy. The method combines feature matching algorithms, including LoFTR, SIFT, and ORB, to create a feature filtering pool and employs a Density-Weighted Homography Optimization (DWHO) algorithm to enhance stitching accuracy. By merging consecutive frames, the framework generates a detailed panoramic view of the esophagus, enabling thorough and accurate visual analysis. Experimental results show the framework achieves low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and high Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) across extensive video sequences, demonstrating its potential for clinical use and improving the quality and continuity of endoscopic visual data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasnat Md Abdullah, Tian Liu, Kangda Wei, Shu Kong, Ruihong Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing unusual activities, such as human errors or surveillance incidents, in videos holds practical significance. However, current video understanding models struggle with localizing these unusual events likely because of their insufficient representation in models' pretraining datasets. To explore foundation models' capability in localizing unusual activity, we introduce UAL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for unusual activity localization, featuring three video datasets: UAG-OOPS, UAG-SSBD, UAG-FunQA, and an instruction-tune dataset: OOPS-UAG-Instruct, to improve model capabilities. UAL-Bench evaluates three approaches: Video-Language Models (Vid-LLMs), instruction-tuned Vid-LLMs, and a novel integration of Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models (VLM-LLM). Our results show the VLM-LLM approach excels in localizing short-span unusual events and predicting their onset (start time) more accurately than Vid-LLMs. We also propose a new metric, R@1, TD <= p, to address limitations in existing evaluation methods. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by long-duration videos, particularly in autism diagnosis scenarios, and the need for further advancements in localization techniques. Our work not only provides a benchmark for unusual activity localization but also outlines the key challenges for existing foundation models, suggesting future research directions on this important task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rochana R. Obadage, Kumushini Thennakoon, Sarah M. Rajtmajer, Jian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Our work aims to reproduce the set of findings published in "Network Deconvolution" by Ye et al. (2020)[1]. That paper proposes an optimization technique for model training in convolutional neural networks. The proposed technique "network deconvolution" is used in convolutional neural networks to remove pixel-wise and channel-wise correlations before data is fed into each layer. In particular, we interrogate the validity of the authors' claim that using network deconvolution instead of batch normalization improves deep learning model performance. Our effort confirms the validity of this claim, successfully reproducing the results reported in Tables 1 and 2 of the original paper. Our study involved 367 unique experiments across multiple architectures, datasets, and hyper parameter configurations. For Table 1, while there were some minor deviations in accuracy when compared to the original values (within 10%), the overall trend was consistent with the original study's findings when training the models with epochs 20 and 100. For Table 2, all 14 reproduced values were consistent with the original values. Additionally, we document the training and testing times for each architecture in Table 1 with 1, 20, and 100 epoch settings for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We document the total execution times for Table 2 architectures with the ImageNet dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingnan Gao, Zhuo Chen, Yichao Yan, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural radiance fields have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis and achieved high-fidelity renderings. However, these methods sacrifice the geometry for the rendering quality, limiting their further applications including relighting and deformation. How to synthesize photo-realistic rendering while reconstructing accurate geometry remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we present AniSDF, a novel approach that learns fused-granularity neural surfaces with physics-based encoding for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. Different from previous neural surfaces, our fused-granularity geometry structure balances the overall structures and fine geometric details, producing accurate geometry reconstruction. To disambiguate geometry from reflective appearance, we introduce blended radiance fields to model diffuse and specularity following the anisotropic spherical Gaussian encoding, a physics-based rendering pipeline. With these designs, AniSDF can reconstruct objects with complex structures and produce high-quality renderings. Furthermore, our method is a unified model that does not require complex hyperparameter tuning for specific objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method boosts the quality of SDF-based methods by a great scale in both geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang Vinh Nguyen, Thanh Hoang Son Vo, Sae-Ryung Kang, Soo-Hyung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment in colonoscopy images. Traditional methods encounter significant challenges in accurately delineating polyps due to limitations in feature representation and the handling of variability in polyp appearance. Deep learning techniques, including CNN and Transformer-based methods, have been explored to improve polyp segmentation accuracy. However, existing approaches often neglect additional semantics, restricting their ability to acquire adequate contexts of polyps in colonoscopy images. In this paper, we propose an innovative method named ``Automatic Polyp Segmentation with Self-Enriched Semantic Model'' to address these limitations. First, we extract a sequence of features from an input image and decode high-level features to generate an initial segmentation mask. Using the proposed self-enriched semantic module, we query potential semantics and augment deep features with additional semantics, thereby aiding the model in understanding context more effectively. Extensive experiments show superior segmentation performance of the proposed method against state-of-the-art polyp segmentation baselines across five polyp benchmarks in both superior learning and generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a novel deep learning framework inspired by atmospheric scattering and human visual cortex mechanisms to enhance object detection under poor visibility scenarios such as fog, smoke, and haze. These conditions pose significant challenges for object recognition, impacting various sectors, including autonomous driving, aviation management, and security systems. The objective is to enhance the precision and reliability of detection systems under adverse environmental conditions. The research investigates the integration of human-like visual cues, particularly focusing on selective attention and environmental adaptability, to ascertain their impact on object detection's computational efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a multi-tiered strategy that integrates an initial quick detection process, followed by targeted region-specific dehazing, and concludes with an in-depth detection phase. The approach is validated using the Foggy Cityscapes, RESIDE-beta (OTS and RTTS) datasets and is anticipated to set new performance standards in detection accuracy while significantly optimizing computational efficiency. The findings offer a viable solution for enhancing object detection in poor visibility and contribute to the broader understanding of integrating human visual principles into deep learning algorithms for intricate visual recognition challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyu Zhuang, Yuxiao He, Jiawei Zhang, Yanwen Wang, Jiahe Zhu, Yao Yao, Siyu Zhu, Xun Cao, Hao Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating 3D head avatars is a significant yet challenging task for many applicated scenarios. Previous studies have set out to learn 3D human head generative models using massive 2D image data. Although these models are highly generalizable for human appearance, their result models are not 360$^\circ$-renderable, and the predicted 3D geometry is unreliable. Therefore, such results cannot be used in VR, game modeling, and other scenarios that require 360$^\circ$-renderable 3D head models. An intuitive idea is that 3D head models with limited amount but high 3D accuracy are more reliable training data for a high-quality 3D generative model. In this vein, we delve into how to learn a native generative model for 360$^\circ$ full head from a limited 3D head dataset. Specifically, three major problems are studied: 1) how to effectively utilize various representations for generating the 360$^\circ$-renderable human head; 2) how to disentangle the appearance, shape, and motion of human faces to generate a 3D head model that can be edited by appearance and driven by motion; 3) and how to extend the generalization capability of the generative model to support downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. We hope the proposed models and artist-designed dataset can inspire future research on learning native generative 3D head models from limited 3D datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01239">Replacement Learning: Training Vision Tasks with Fewer Learnable Parameters</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuming Zhang, Peizhe Wang, Shouxin Zhang, Dongzhi Guan, Jiabin Liu, Junhao Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional end-to-end deep learning models often enhance feature representation and overall performance by increasing the depth and complexity of the network during training. However, this approach inevitably introduces issues of parameter redundancy and resource inefficiency, especially in deeper networks. While existing works attempt to skip certain redundant layers to alleviate these problems, challenges related to poor performance, computational complexity, and inefficient memory usage remain. To address these issues, we propose an innovative training approach called Replacement Learning, which mitigates these limitations by completely replacing all the parameters of the frozen layers with only two learnable parameters. Specifically, Replacement Learning selectively freezes the parameters of certain layers, and the frozen layers utilize parameters from adjacent layers, updating them through a parameter integration mechanism controlled by two learnable parameters. This method leverages information from surrounding structures, reduces computation, conserves GPU memory, and maintains a balance between historical context and new inputs, ultimately enhancing overall model performance. We conducted experiments across four benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, STL-10, SVHN, and ImageNet, utilizing various architectures such as CNNs and ViTs to validate the effectiveness of Replacement Learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the number of parameters, training time, and memory consumption while completely surpassing the performance of end-to-end training.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01251">Facial Action Unit Detection by Adaptively Constraining Self-Attention and Causally Deconfounding Sample</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwen Shao, Hancheng Zhu, Yong Zhou, Xiang Xiang, Bing Liu, Rui Yao, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial action unit (AU) detection remains a challenging task, due to the subtlety, dynamics, and diversity of AUs. Recently, the prevailing techniques of self-attention and causal inference have been introduced to AU detection. However, most existing methods directly learn self-attention guided by AU detection, or employ common patterns for all AUs during causal intervention. The former often captures irrelevant information in a global range, and the latter ignores the specific causal characteristic of each AU. In this paper, we propose a novel AU detection framework called AC2D by adaptively constraining self-attention weight distribution and causally deconfounding the sample confounder. Specifically, we explore the mechanism of self-attention weight distribution, in which the self-attention weight distribution of each AU is regarded as spatial distribution and is adaptively learned under the constraint of location-predefined attention and the guidance of AU detection. Moreover, we propose a causal intervention module for each AU, in which the bias caused by training samples and the interference from irrelevant AUs are both suppressed. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art AU detection approaches on challenging benchmarks, including BP4D, DISFA, GFT, and BP4D+ in constrained scenarios and Aff-Wild2 in unconstrained scenarios.

<p>Abstract: There is a gap in the understanding of occluded objects in existing large-scale visual language multi-modal models. Current state-of-the-art multimodal models fail to provide satisfactory results in describing occluded objects for visual-language multimodal models through universal visual encoders. Another challenge is the limited number of datasets containing image-text pairs with a large number of occluded objects. Therefore, we introduce a novel multimodal model that applies a newly designed visual encoder to understand occluded objects in RGB images. We also introduce a large-scale visual-language pair dataset for training large-scale visual-language multimodal models and understanding occluded objects. We start our experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01262">Aggregation of Multi Diffusion Models for Enhancing Learned Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Conghan Yue, Zhengwei Peng, Shiyan Du, Zhi Ji, Dongyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, particularly with the various applications of classifier-free guidance conditional diffusion models. While many diffusion models perform well when controlling for particular aspect among style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Aggregation of Multi Diffusion Models (AMDM), which synthesizes features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model, enhancing its learned representations to activate specific features for fine-grained control. AMDM consists of two key components: spherical aggregation and manifold optimization. Spherical aggregation merges intermediate variables from different diffusion models with minimal manifold deviation, while manifold optimization refines these variables to align with the intermediate data manifold, enhancing sampling quality. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without additional training or inference time, proving its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional control generation in diffusion models: We can fully utilize existing conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, or develop new ones, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs. Code is available at: https://github.com/Hammour-steak/AMDM</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weimin Lyu, Jiachen Yao, Saumya Gupta, Lu Pang, Tao Sun, Lingjie Yi, Lijie Hu, Haibin Ling, Chao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) represents a significant advancement in integrating computer vision with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed text descriptions from visual inputs. Despite their growing importance, the security of VLMs, particularly against backdoor attacks, is under explored. Moreover, prior works often assume attackers have access to the original training data, which is often unrealistic. In this paper, we address a more practical and challenging scenario where attackers must rely solely on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. We introduce VLOOD (Backdooring Vision-Language Models with Out-of-Distribution Data), a novel approach with two key contributions: (1) demonstrating backdoor attacks on VLMs in complex image-to-text tasks while minimizing degradation of the original semantics under poisoned inputs, and (2) proposing innovative techniques for backdoor injection without requiring any access to the original training data. Our evaluation on image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks confirms the effectiveness of VLOOD, revealing a critical security vulnerability in VLMs and laying the foundation for future research on securing multimodal models against sophisticated threats.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D object detection with omnidirectional views enables safety-critical applications such as mobile robot navigation. Such applications increasingly operate on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating reliable processing without privacy concerns or network delays. To enable cost-effective deployment, cameras have been widely adopted as a low-cost alternative to LiDAR sensors. However, the compute-intensive workload to achieve high performance of camera-based solutions remains challenging due to the computational limitations of edge devices. In this paper, we present Panopticus, a carefully designed system for omnidirectional and camera-based 3D detection on edge devices. Panopticus employs an adaptive multi-branch detection scheme that accounts for spatial complexities. To optimize the accuracy within latency limits, Panopticus dynamically adjusts the model's architecture and operations based on available edge resources and spatial characteristics. We implemented Panopticus on three edge devices and conducted experiments across real-world environments based on the public self-driving dataset and our mobile 360{\deg} camera dataset. Experiment results showed that Panopticus improves accuracy by 62% on average given the strict latency objective of 33ms. Also, Panopticus achieves a 2.1{\times} latency reduction on average compared to baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hierarchical autoencoder that maps 3D models into a highly compressed latent space. The hierarchical autoencoder is specifically designed to tackle the challenges arising from large-scale datasets and generative modeling using diffusion. Different from previous approaches that only work on a regular image or volume grid, our hierarchical autoencoder operates on unordered sets of vectors. Each level of the autoencoder controls different geometric levels of detail. We show that the model can be used to represent a wide range of 3D models while faithfully representing high-resolution geometry details. The training of the new architecture takes 0.70x time and 0.58x memory compared to the baseline. We also explore how the new representation can be used for generative modeling. Specifically, we propose a cascaded diffusion framework where each stage is conditioned on the previous stage. Our design extends existing cascaded designs for image and volume grids to vector sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The task of action spotting consists in both identifying actions and precisely localizing them in time with a single timestamp in long, untrimmed video streams. Automatically extracting those actions is crucial for many sports applications, including sports analytics to produce extended statistics on game actions, coaching to provide support to video analysts, or fan engagement to automatically overlay content in the broadcast when specific actions occur. However, before 2018, no large-scale datasets for action spotting in sports were publicly available, which impeded benchmarking action spotting methods. In response, our team built the largest dataset and the most comprehensive benchmarks for sports video understanding, under the umbrella of SoccerNet. Particularly, our dataset contains a subset specifically dedicated to action spotting, called SoccerNet Action Spotting, containing more than 550 complete broadcast games annotated with almost all types of actions that can occur in a football game. This dataset is tailored to develop methods for automatic spotting of actions of interest, including deep learning approaches, by providing a large amount of manually annotated actions. To engage with the scientific community, the SoccerNet initiative organizes yearly challenges, during which participants from all around the world compete to achieve state-of-the-art performances. Thanks to our dataset and challenges, more than 60 methods were developed or published over the past five years, improving on the first baselines and making action spotting a viable option for the sports industry. This paper traces the history of action spotting in sports, from the creation of the task back in 2018, to the role it plays today in research and the sports industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyun Jang, Mincheol Chang, Jongwon Park, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors have been largely utilized in various applications, including autonomous vehicles or mobile robots. However, LiDAR-based detectors often fail to adapt well to target domains with different sensor configurations (e.g., types of sensors, spatial resolution, or FOVs) and location shifts. Collecting and annotating datasets in a new setup is commonly required to reduce such gaps, but it is often expensive and time-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained backbones can be learned in a self-supervised manner with large-scale unlabeled LiDAR frames. However, despite their expressive representations, they remain challenging to generalize well without substantial amounts of data from the target domain. Thus, we propose a novel method, called Domain Adaptive Distill-Tuning (DADT), to adapt a pre-trained model with limited target data (approximately 100 LiDAR frames), retaining its representation power and preventing it from overfitting. Specifically, we use regularizers to align object-level and context-level representations between the pre-trained and finetuned models in a teacher-student architecture. Our experiments with driving benchmarks, i.e., Waymo Open dataset and KITTI, confirm that our method effectively finetunes a pre-trained model, achieving significant gains in accuracy.</p>

Our method involves converting PDF files into SVG format and creating a feature-rich graph representation, which captures the relationships between vector entities using geometrical information. We then apply a graph attention transformer with hierarchical label definition to achieve accurate line-level segmentation. Our approach is evaluated on two datasets, including the public FloorplanCAD dataset, which achieves state-of-the-art results on weighted F1 score, surpassing existing methods. The proposed vector-based method offers a more scalable solution for large-scale technical drawing analysis compared to vision-based approaches, while also requiring significantly less GPU power than current state-of-the-art vector-based techniques. Moreover, it demonstrates improved performance in terms of the weighted F1 (wF1) score on the semantic segmentation task. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting meaningful information from technical drawings, enabling new applications, and improving existing workflows in the AEC industry. Potential applications of our approach include automated building information modeling (BIM) and construction planning, which could significantly impact the efficiency and productivity of the industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaofeng Shi, Heqian Qiu, Lanxiao Wang, Fanman Meng, Qingbo Wu, Hongliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel Text-supervised Egocentic Semantic Segmentation (TESS) task that aims to assign pixel-level categories to egocentric images weakly supervised by texts from image-level labels. In this task with prospective potential, the egocentric scenes contain dense wearer-object relations and inter-object interference. However, most recent third-view methods leverage the frozen Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, which is pre-trained on the semantic-oriented third-view data and lapses in the egocentric view due to the ``relation insensitive" problem. Hence, we propose a Cognition Transferring and Decoupling Network (CTDN) that first learns the egocentric wearer-object relations via correlating the image and text. Besides, a Cognition Transferring Module (CTM) is developed to distill the cognitive knowledge from the large-scale pre-trained model to our model for recognizing egocentric objects with various semantics. Based on the transferred cognition, the Foreground-background Decoupling Module (FDM) disentangles the visual representations to explicitly discriminate the foreground and background regions to mitigate false activation areas caused by foreground-background interferential objects during egocentric relation learning. Extensive experiments on four TESS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms many recent related methods by a large margin.

Previous works usually suffer from the trade-off between the capture costs and the quality of details. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can achieve detailed eyelid reconstruction and animation by only using an RGB video captured by a mobile phone. Our method utilizes both static and dynamic information of eyeballs (e.g., positions and rotations) to assist the eyelid reconstruction, cooperating with an automatic eyeball calibration method to get the required eyeball parameters. Furthermore, we develop a neural eyelid control module to achieve the semantic animation control of eyelids. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first method for high-quality eyelid reconstruction and animation from lightweight captures. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our method can provide more detailed and realistic results compared with previous methods based on the same-level capture setups.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kento Masui, Mayu Otani, Masahiro Nomura, Hideki Nakayama</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown the ability to generate high-quality images. However, controlling its generation process still poses challenges. The image style transfer task is one of those challenges that transfers the visual attributes of a style image to another content image. Typical obstacle of this task is the requirement of additional training of a pre-trained model. We propose a training-free style transfer algorithm, Style Tracking Reverse Diffusion Process (STRDP) for a pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Our algorithm employs Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) function in a distinct manner during the reverse diffusion process of an LDM while tracking the encoding history of the style image. This algorithm enables style transfer in the latent space of LDM for reduced computational cost, and provides compatibility for various LDM models. Through a series of experiments and a user study, we show that our method can quickly transfer the style of an image without additional training. The speed, compatibility, and training-free aspect of our algorithm facilitates agile experiments with combinations of styles and LDMs for extensive application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Casta\~neda Garcia, Jan van Gemert, Daan Brinks, Nergis T\"omen</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting physical dynamical system parameters from videos is of great interest to applications in natural science and technology. The state-of-the-art in automatic parameter estimation from video is addressed by training supervised deep networks on large datasets. Such datasets require labels, which are difficult to acquire. While some unsupervised techniques -- which depend on frame prediction -- exist, they suffer from long training times, instability under different initializations, and are limited to hand-picked motion problems. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the physical parameters of any known, continuous governing equation from single videos; our solution is suitable for different dynamical systems beyond motion and is robust to initialization compared to previous approaches. Moreover, we remove the need for frame prediction by implementing a KL-divergence-based loss function in the latent space, which avoids convergence to trivial solutions and reduces model size and compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toshiki Kindo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new statistical approach to automatically identify cancer regions in pathological images. The proposed method is built from statistical theory in line with evidence-based medicine. The two core technologies are the classification information of image features, which was introduced based on information theory and which cancer features take positive values, normal features take negative values, and the calculation technique for determining their spatial distribution. This method then estimates areas where the classification information content shows a positive value as cancer areas in the pathological image. The method achieves AUCs of 0.95 or higher in cancer classification tasks. In addition, the proposed method has the practical advantage of not requiring a precise demarcation line between cancer and normal. This frees pathologists from the monotonous and tedious work of building consensus with other pathologists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Li, Linyuan Wang, Guangwei Xiong, Bin Yan, Dekui Ma, Jinxian Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development and application of deep learning in signal detection tasks, the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks has also become a security threat to signal detection networks. This paper defines a signal adversarial examples generation model for signal detection network from the perspective of adding perturbations to the signal. The model uses the inequality relationship of L2-norm between time domain and time-frequency domain to constrain the energy of signal perturbations. Building upon this model, we propose a method for generating signal adversarial examples utilizing gradient-based attacks and Short-Time Fourier Transform. The experimental results show that under the constraint of signal perturbation energy ratio less than 3%, our adversarial attack resulted in a 28.1% reduction in the mean Average Precision (mAP), a 24.7% reduction in recall, and a 30.4% reduction in precision of the signal detection network. Compared to random noise perturbation of equivalent intensity, our adversarial attack demonstrates a significant attack effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongru Yan, Yu Zheng, Yueqi Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Umair Nawaz, Muhammad Awais, Hanan Gani, Muzammal Naseer, Fahad Khan, Salman Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer</p>
<p>Abstract: Capitalizing on vast amount of image-text data, large-scale vision-language pre-training has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities and has been utilized in several applications. However, models trained on general everyday web-crawled data often exhibit sub-optimal performance for specialized domains, likely due to domain shift. Recent works have tackled this problem for some domains (e.g., healthcare) by constructing domain-specialized image-text data. However, constructing a dedicated large-scale image-text dataset for sustainable area of agriculture and livestock is still open to research. Further, this domain desires fine-grained feature learning due to the subtle nature of the downstream tasks (e.g, nutrient deficiency detection, livestock breed classification). To address this we present AgriCLIP, a vision-language foundational model dedicated to the domain of agriculture and livestock. First, we propose a large-scale dataset, named ALive, that leverages customized prompt generation strategy to overcome the scarcity of expert annotations. Our ALive dataset covers crops, livestock, and fishery, with around 600,000 image-text pairs. Second, we propose a training pipeline that integrates both contrastive and self-supervised learning to learn both global semantic and local fine-grained domain-specialized features. Experiments on diverse set of 20 downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of AgriCLIP framework, achieving an absolute gain of 7.8\% in terms of average zero-shot classification accuracy, over the standard CLIP adaptation via domain-specialized ALive dataset. Our ALive dataset and code can be accessible at \href{https://github.com/umair1221/AgriCLIP/tree/main}{Github}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Wang, Yu Mao, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: The multimodal model has demonstrated promise in histopathology. However, most multimodal models are based on H\&E and genomics, adopting increasingly complex yet black-box designs. In our paper, we propose a novel interpretable multimodal framework named SHAP-CAT, which uses a Shapley-value-based dimension reduction technique for effective multimodal fusion. Starting with two paired modalities -- H\&E and IHC images, we employ virtual staining techniques to enhance limited input data by generating a new clinical-related modality. Lightweight bag-level representations are extracted from image modalities and a Shapley-value-based mechanism is used for dimension reduction. For each dimension of the bag-level representation, attribution values are calculated to indicate how changes in the specific dimensions of the input affect the model output. In this way, we select a few top important dimensions of bag-level representation for each image modality to late fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SHAP-CAT framework incorporating synthetic modalities significantly enhances model performance, yielding a 5\% increase in accuracy for the BCI, an 8\% increase for IHC4BC-ER, and an 11\% increase for the IHC4BC-PR dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Li, Nanxi Li, Yuanjie Chen, Jianbin Zhu, Qinlu Guo, Cewu Lu, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive capability. However, recently many deficiencies of MLLMs have been found compared to human intelligence, $\textit{e.g.}$, hallucination. To drive the MLLMs study, the community dedicated efforts to building larger benchmarks with complex tasks. In this paper, we propose benchmarking an essential but usually overlooked intelligence: $\textbf{association}$, a human's basic capability to link observation and prior practice memory. To comprehensively investigate MLLM's performance on the association, we formulate the association task and devise a standard benchmark based on adjective and verb semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and curation, we propose a convenient $\textbf{annotation-free}$ construction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Simultaneously, we devise a rigorous data refinement process to eliminate confusion in the raw dataset. Building on this database, we establish three levels of association tasks: single-step, synchronous, and asynchronous associations. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the MLLMs' zero-shot association capabilities, addressing multiple dimensions, including three distinct memory strategies, both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, cutting-edge Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and the involvement of human experts. Our systematic investigation shows that current open-source MLLMs consistently exhibit poor capability in our association tasks, even the currently state-of-the-art GPT-4V(vision) also has a significant gap compared to humans. We believe our benchmark would pave the way for future MLLM studies. $\textit{Our data and code are available at:}$ https://mvig-rhos.com/llm_inception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingdong Hu, Zhening Liu, Jiawei Shao, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting method has demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time human novel view synthesis. However, existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the 3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of our EVA-Gaussian approach in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has developed rapidly over the last decade and has been applied in many areas of computer vision. Decorrelation-based self-supervised pretraining has shown great promise among non-contrastive algorithms, yielding performance at par with supervised and contrastive self-supervised baselines. In this work, we explore the decorrelation-based paradigm of self-supervised learning and apply the same to learning disentangled stroke features for writer identification. Here we propose a modified formulation of the decorrelation-based framework named SWIS which was proposed for signature verification by standardizing the features along each dimension on top of the existing framework. We show that the proposed framework outperforms the contemporary self-supervised learning framework on the writer identification benchmark and also outperforms several supervised methods as well. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to apply self-supervised learning for learning representations for writer verification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osher Rafaeli, Tal Svoray, Ariel Nahlieli</p>
<p>Abstract: Soil sinkholes significantly influence soil degradation, but their irregular shapes, along with interference from shadow and vegetation, make it challenging to accurately quantify their properties using remotely sensed data. We present a novel framework for sinkhole segmentation that combines traditional topographic computations of closed depressions with the newly developed prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM). Within this framework, termed SinkSAM, we highlight four key improvements: (1) The integration of topographic computations with SAM enables pixel-level refinement of sinkhole boundaries segmentation; (2) A coherent mathematical prompting strategy, based on closed depressions, addresses the limitations of purely learning-based models (CNNs) in detecting and segmenting undefined sinkhole features, while improving generalization to new, unseen regions; (3) Using Depth Anything V2 monocular depth for automatic prompts eliminates photogrammetric biases, enabling sinkhole mapping without the dependence on LiDAR data; and (4) An established sinkhole database facilitates fine-tuning of SAM, improving its zero-shot performance in sinkhole segmentation. These advancements allow the deployment of SinkSAM, in an unseen test area, in the highly variable semiarid region, achieving an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 40.27\% and surpassing previous results. This paper also presents the first SAM implementation for sinkhole segmentation and demonstrates the robustness of SinkSAM in extracting sinkhole maps using a single RGB image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Zhang, Manuel G\"unther</p>
<p>Abstract: Face recognition in the wild has gained a lot of focus in the last few years, and many face recognition models are designed to verify faces in medium-quality images. Especially due to the availability of large training datasets with similar conditions, deep face recognition models perform exceptionally well in such tasks. However, in other tasks where substantially less training data is available, such methods struggle, especially when required to compare high-quality enrollment images with low-quality probes. On the other hand, traditional RankList-based methods have been developed that compare faces indirectly by comparing to cohort faces with similar conditions. In this paper, we revisit these RankList methods and extend them to use the logits of the state-of-the-art DaliFace network, instead of an external cohort. We show that through a reasonable Logit-Cohort Selection (LoCoS) the performance of RankList-based functions can be improved drastically. Experiments on two challenging face recognition datasets not only demonstrate the enhanced performance of our proposed method but also set the stage for future advancements in handling diverse image qualities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dexuan Ding, Lei Wang, Liyun Zhu, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains, and modalities, such as text, images, and videos. Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing similarity graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise similarity score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) offers the capability to achieve real-time high quality 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS assumes that the scene is in a clear medium environment and struggles to generate satisfactory representations in underwater scenes, where light absorption and scattering are prevalent and moving objects are involved. To overcome these, we introduce a novel Gaussian Splatting-based method, UW-GS, designed specifically for underwater applications. It introduces a color appearance that models distance-dependent color variation, employs a new physics-based density control strategy to enhance clarity for distant objects, and uses a binary motion mask to handle dynamic content. Optimized with a well-designed loss function supporting for scattering media and strengthened by pseudo-depth maps, UW-GS outperforms existing methods with PSNR gains up to 1.26dB. To fully verify the effectiveness of the model, we also developed a new underwater dataset, S-UW, with dynamic object masks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) approximate discrete data through continuous functions and are commonly used for encoding 2D images. Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijie Tu, Weijian Deng, Tom Gedeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown significant potential, particularly in zero-shot classification across diverse distribution shifts. Building on existing evaluations of overall classification robustness, this work aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of CLIP by introducing several new perspectives. First, we investigate their robustness to variations in specific visual factors. Second, we assess two critical safety objectives--confidence uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection--beyond mere classification accuracy. Third, we evaluate the finesse with which CLIP models bridge the image and text modalities. Fourth, we extend our examination to 3D awareness in CLIP models, moving beyond traditional 2D image understanding. Finally, we explore the interaction between vision and language encoders within modern large multimodal models (LMMs) that utilize CLIP as the visual backbone, focusing on how this interaction impacts classification robustness. In each aspect, we consider the impact of six factors on CLIP models: model architecture, training distribution, training set size, fine-tuning, contrastive loss, and test-time prompts. Our study uncovers several previously unknown insights into CLIP. For instance, the architecture of the visual encoder in CLIP plays a significant role in their robustness against 3D corruption. CLIP models tend to exhibit a bias towards shape when making predictions. Moreover, this bias tends to diminish after fine-tuning on ImageNet. Vision-language models like LLaVA, leveraging the CLIP vision encoder, could exhibit benefits in classification performance for challenging categories over CLIP alone. Our findings are poised to offer valuable guidance for enhancing the robustness and reliability of CLIP models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity. However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors, complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise editing while maintaining high quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Representing images or videos as object-level feature vectors, rather than pixel-level feature maps, facilitates advanced visual tasks. Object-Centric Learning (OCL) primarily achieves this by reconstructing the input under the guidance of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) intermediate representation to drive so-called \textit{slots} to aggregate as much object information as possible. However, existing VAE guidance does not explicitly address that objects can vary in pixel sizes while models typically excel at specific pattern scales. We propose \textit{Multi-Scale Fusion} (MSF) to enhance VAE guidance for OCL training. To ensure objects of all sizes fall within VAE's comfort zone, we adopt the \textit{image pyramid}, which produces intermediate representations at multiple scales; To foster scale-invariance/variance in object super-pixels, we devise \textit{inter}/\textit{intra-scale fusion}, which augments low-quality object super-pixels of one scale with corresponding high-quality super-pixels from another scale. On standard OCL benchmarks, our technique improves mainstream methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones. The source code is available in the supplemental material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jente Vandersanden, Sascha Holl, Xingchang Huang, Gurprit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM). In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID score) of up to 30% for both tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaiquan Yang, Yuhao Liu, Jiaying Lin, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the weakly-supervised referring image segmentation (WRIS) problem, and focuses on a challenging setup where target localization is learned directly from image-text pairs. We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object. Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three common benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyan Zhang, Hao Zheng, Xin You, Yefeng Zheng, Yun Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising paradigm to handle the domain shifts at test time for medical images from different institutions without using extra training data. However, existing TTA solutions for segmentation tasks suffer from (1) dependency on modifying the source training stage and access to source priors or (2) lack of emphasis on shape-related semantic knowledge that is crucial for segmentation tasks.Recent research on visual prompt learning achieves source-relaxed adaptation by extended parameter space but still neglects the full utilization of semantic features, thus motivating our work on knowledge-enriched deep prompt learning. Beyond the general concern of image style shifts, we reveal that shape variability is another crucial factor causing the performance drop. To address this issue, we propose a TTA framework called PASS (Prompting to Adapt Styles and Semantic shapes), which jointly learns two types of prompts: the input-space prompt to reformulate the style of the test image to fit into the pretrained model and the semantic-aware prompts to bridge high-level shape discrepancy across domains. Instead of naively imposing a fixed prompt, we introduce an input decorator to generate the self-regulating visual prompt conditioned on the input data. To retrieve the knowledge representations and customize target-specific shape prompts for each test sample, we propose a cross-attention prompt modulator, which performs interaction between target representations and an enriched shape prompt bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PASS over state-of-the-art methods on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sina Mavali, Jonas Ricker, David Pape, Yash Sharma, Asja Fischer, Lea Schoenherr</p>
<p>Abstract: While generative AI (GenAI) offers countless possibilities for creative and productive tasks, artificially generated media can be misused for fraud, manipulation, scams, misinformation campaigns, and more. To mitigate the risks associated with maliciously generated media, forensic classifiers are employed to identify AI-generated content. However, current forensic classifiers are often not evaluated in practically relevant scenarios, such as the presence of an attacker or when real-world artifacts like social media degradations affect images. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors under different attack scenarios. We demonstrate that forensic classifiers can be effectively attacked in realistic settings, even when the attacker does not have access to the target model and post-processing occurs after the adversarial examples are created, which is standard on social media platforms. These attacks can significantly reduce detection accuracy to the extent that the risks of relying on detectors outweigh their benefits. Finally, we propose a simple defense mechanism to make CLIP-based detectors, which are currently the best-performing detectors, robust against these attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) offers tissue-specific physical parameters with significant potential for neuroscience research and clinical practice. However, lengthy scan times for 3D multiparametric qMRI acquisition limit its clinical utility. Here, we propose SUMMIT, an innovative imaging methodology that includes data acquisition and an unsupervised reconstruction for simultaneous multiparametric qMRI. SUMMIT first encodes multiple important quantitative properties into highly undersampled k-space. It further leverages implicit neural representation incorporated with a dedicated physics model to reconstruct the desired multiparametric maps without needing external training datasets. SUMMIT delivers co-registered T1, T2, T2*, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Extensive simulations and phantom imaging demonstrate SUMMIT's high accuracy. Additionally, the proposed unsupervised approach for qMRI reconstruction also introduces a novel zero-shot learning paradigm for multiparametric imaging applicable to various medical imaging modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhen Sun, Weining Wang, Yanyuan Qiao, Jiahui Sun, Zihan Qin, Longteng Guo, Xinxin Zhu, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sounding Video Generation (SVG) is an audio-video joint generation task challenged by high-dimensional signal spaces, distinct data formats, and different patterns of content information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel multi-modal latent diffusion model (MM-LDM) for the SVG task. We first unify the representation of audio and video data by converting them into a single or a couple of images. Then, we introduce a hierarchical multi-modal autoencoder that constructs a low-level perceptual latent space for each modality and a shared high-level semantic feature space. The former space is perceptually equivalent to the raw signal space of each modality but drastically reduces signal dimensions. The latter space serves to bridge the information gap between modalities and provides more insightful cross-modal guidance. Our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results with significant quality and efficiency gains. Specifically, our method achieves a comprehensive improvement on all evaluation metrics and a faster training and sampling speed on Landscape and AIST++ datasets. Moreover, we explore its performance on open-domain sounding video generation, long sounding video generation, audio continuation, video continuation, and conditional single-modal generation tasks for a comprehensive evaluation, where our MM-LDM demonstrates exciting adaptability and generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouyan Navard, Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mengxi Zhou, Wei-Lun Chao, Alper Yilmaz, Rajiv Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image (T2I) generation, but they often struggle to balance fine-grained precision with high-level control. Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Ding, Soyeon Caren Han, Zechuan Li, Hyunsuk Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Visually-Rich Documents (VRDs), encompassing elements like charts, tables, and references, convey complex information across various fields. However, extracting information from these rich documents is labor-intensive, especially given their inconsistent formats and domain-specific requirements. While pretrained models for VRD Understanding have progressed, their reliance on large, annotated datasets limits scalability. This paper introduces the Domain Adaptive Visually-rich Document Understanding (DAViD) framework, which utilises machine-generated synthetic data for domain adaptation. DAViD integrates fine-grained and coarse-grained document representation learning and employs synthetic annotations to reduce the need for costly manual labelling. By leveraging pretrained models and synthetic data, DAViD achieves competitive performance with minimal annotated datasets. Extensive experiments validate DAViD's effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to efficiently adapt to domain-specific VRDU tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaobo Wang, Yantai Yang, Shuaiyu Zhang, Chenghao Sun, Weiya Li, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset reduction (DR) seeks to select or distill samples from large datasets into smaller subsets while preserving performance on target tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on pruning or synthesizing data in the same format as the original dataset, typically the input data and corresponding labels. However, in DR settings, we find it is possible to synthesize more information beyond the data-label pair as an additional learning target to facilitate model training. In this paper, we introduce Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information (DRUPI), which enriches DR by synthesizing privileged information alongside the reduced dataset. This privileged information can take the form of feature labels or attention labels, providing auxiliary supervision to improve model learning. Our findings reveal that effective feature labels must balance between being overly discriminative and excessively diverse, with a moderate level proving optimal for improving the reduced dataset's efficacy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that DRUPI integrates seamlessly with existing dataset reduction methods, offering significant performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Shuzhe Wang, Matias Turkulainen, Junyuan Fang, Juho Kannala</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have revolutionized novel view synthesis, facilitating real-time, high-quality image rendering. However, in scenarios involving reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors, 3D-GS often misinterprets reflections as virtual spaces, resulting in blurred and inconsistent multi-view rendering within mirrors. Our paper presents a novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality. We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more diverse evaluation. Experimental validation on both Mirror-Nerf and our real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve comparable or superior results while significantly reducing training time compared to previous state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Ji, Shenghai Yuan, Jianping Li, Pengyu Yin, Haozhi Cao, Lihua Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR bundle adjustment (BA) is an effective approach to reduce the drifts in pose estimation from the front-end. Existing works on LiDAR BA usually rely on predefined geometric features for landmark representation. This reliance restricts generalizability, as the system will inevitably deteriorate in environments where these specific features are absent. To address this issue, we propose SGBA, a LiDAR BA scheme that models the environment as a semantic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) without predefined feature types. This approach encodes both geometric and semantic information, offering a comprehensive and general representation adaptable to various environments. Additionally, to limit computational complexity while ensuring generalizability, we propose an adaptive semantic selection framework that selects the most informative semantic clusters for optimization by evaluating the condition number of the cost function. Lastly, we introduce a probabilistic feature association scheme that considers the entire probability density of assignments, which can manage uncertainties in measurement and initial pose estimation. We have conducted various experiments and the results demonstrate that SGBA can achieve accurate and robust pose refinement even in challenging scenarios with low-quality initial pose estimation and limited geometric features. We plan to open-source the work for the benefit of the community https://github.com/Ji1Xinyu/SGBA.</p>

We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art LVLMs and find that they are far from perfect for comprehending ophthalmology images.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation requires large amount of training data to synthesizing high-quality images. For augmenting training data, previous methods rely on data interpolations like cropping, flipping, and mixing up, which fail to introduce new information and yield only marginal improvements. In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation method for text-to-image generation using linear extrapolation. Specifically, we apply linear extrapolation only on text feature, and new image data are retrieved from the internet by search engines. For the reliability of new text-image pairs, we design two outlier detectors to purify retrieved images. Based on extrapolation, we construct training samples dozens of times larger than the original dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in text-to-image performance. Moreover, we propose a NULL-guidance to refine score estimation, and apply recurrent affine transformation to fuse text information. Our model achieves FID scores of 7.91, 9.52 and 5.00 on the CUB, Oxford and COCO datasets. The code and data will be available on GitHub (https://github.com/senmaoy/RAT-Diffusion).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Cao, Yuanliang Jv, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations. Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii) Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels, leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our 3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det, achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking plays a critical role in autonomous driving by enabling the real-time monitoring and prediction of multiple objects' movements. Traditional 3D tracking systems are typically constrained by predefined object categories, limiting their adaptability to novel, unseen objects in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we introduce open-vocabulary 3D tracking, which extends the scope of 3D tracking to include objects beyond predefined categories. We formulate the problem of open-vocabulary 3D tracking and introduce dataset splits designed to represent various open-vocabulary scenarios. We propose a novel approach that integrates open-vocabulary capabilities into a 3D tracking framework, allowing for generalization to unseen object classes. Our method effectively reduces the performance gap between tracking known and novel objects through strategic adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our method in diverse outdoor driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address open-vocabulary 3D tracking, presenting a significant advancement for autonomous systems in real-world settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Teng, Han Shi, Xian Liu, Xuefei Ning, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang, Zhenguo Li, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The current large auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, high-resolution images, but these models require hundreds or even thousands of steps of next-token prediction during inference, resulting in substantial time consumption. In existing studies, Jacobi decoding, an iterative parallel decoding algorithm, has been used to accelerate the auto-regressive generation and can be executed without training. However, the Jacobi decoding relies on a deterministic criterion to determine the convergence of iterations. Thus, it works for greedy decoding but is incompatible with sampling-based decoding which is crucial for visual quality and diversity in the current auto-regressive text-to-image generation. In this paper, we propose a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm, Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD), to accelerate auto-regressive text-to-image generation. By introducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the inference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the randomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate diverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple tokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion, enabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional next-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization strategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve the acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our proposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models, showing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingzhen Sun, Weining Wang, Xinxin Zhu, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Since videos record objects moving coherently, adjacent video frames have commonness (similar object appearances) and uniqueness (slightly changed postures). To prevent redundant modeling of common video signals, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework, named COMUNI, which decomposes the COMmon and UNIque video signals to enable efficient video generation. Our approach separates the decomposition of video signals from the task of video generation, thus reducing the computation complexity of generative models. In particular, we introduce CU-VAE to decompose video signals and encode them into latent features. To train CU-VAE in a self-supervised manner, we employ a cascading merge module to reconstitute video signals and a time-agnostic video decoder to reconstruct video frames. Then we propose CU-LDM to model latent features for video generation, which adopts two specific diffusion streams to simultaneously model the common and unique latent features. We further utilize additional joint modules for cross modeling of the common and unique latent features, and a novel position embedding method to ensure the content consistency and motion coherence of generated videos. The position embedding method incorporates spatial and temporal absolute position information into the joint modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate the necessity of decomposing common and unique video signals for video generation and the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamin Xu, Zelong Li, Yuxin Zheng, Chenyu Huang, Renshu Gu, Weiwei Xu, Gang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Shadows can originate from occlusions in both direct and indirect illumination. Although most current shadow removal research focuses on shadows caused by direct illumination, shadows from indirect illumination are often just as pervasive, particularly in indoor scenes. A significant challenge in removing shadows from indirect illumination is obtaining shadow-free images to train the shadow removal network. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel rendering pipeline for generating shadowed and shadow-free images under direct and indirect illumination, and create a comprehensive synthetic dataset that contains over 30,000 image pairs, covering various object types and lighting conditions. We also propose an innovative shadow removal network that explicitly integrates semantic and geometric priors through concatenation and attention mechanisms. The experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shadow removal techniques and can effectively generalize to indoor and outdoor scenes under various lighting conditions, enhancing the overall effectiveness and applicability of shadow removal methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rinon Gal, Adi Haviv, Yuval Alaluf, Amit H. Bermano, Daniel Cohen-Or, Gal Chechik</p>
<p>Abstract: The practical use of text-to-image generation has evolved from simple, monolithic models to complex workflows that combine multiple specialized components. While workflow-based approaches can lead to improved image quality, crafting effective workflows requires significant expertise, owing to the large number of available components, their complex inter-dependence, and their dependence on the generation prompt. Here, we introduce the novel task of prompt-adaptive workflow generation, where the goal is to automatically tailor a workflow to each user prompt. We propose two LLM-based approaches to tackle this task: a tuning-based method that learns from user-preference data, and a training-free method that uses the LLM to select existing flows. Both approaches lead to improved image quality when compared to monolithic models or generic, prompt-independent workflows. Our work shows that prompt-dependent flow prediction offers a new pathway to improving text-to-image generation quality, complementing existing research directions in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Miao, Wenqiao Zhang, Juncheng Li, Siliang Tang, Zhaocheng Li, Haochen Shi, Jun Xiao, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIAD), utilizing 3D point clouds and 2D RGB images to identify the abnormal region of products, plays a crucial role in industrial quality inspection. However, the conventional MIAD setting presupposes that all 2D and 3D modalities are paired, overlooking the fact that multimodal data collected from the real world is often imperfect due to missing modalities. Consequently, MIAD models that demonstrate robustness against modal-incomplete data are highly desirable in practice. To address this practical challenge, we introduce a first-of-its-kind study that comprehensively investigates Modality-Incomplete Industrial Anomaly Detection (MIIAD), to consider the imperfect learning environment in which the multimodal information may be incomplete. Not surprisingly, we discovered that most existing MIAD approaches are inadequate for addressing MIIAD challenges, leading to significant performance degradation on the MIIAD benchmark we developed. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage Robust modAlity-imcomplete fusing and Detecting frAmewoRk, abbreviated as RADAR. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to enhance two stages in MIIAD, improving the robustness of the Multimodal Transformer: i) In feature fusion, we first explore learning modality-incomplete instruction, guiding the pre-trained Multimodal Transformer to robustly adapt to various modality-incomplete scenarios, and implement adaptive parameter learning based on a HyperNetwork; ii) In anomaly detection, we construct a real-pseudo hybrid module to highlight the distinctiveness of modality combinations, further enhancing the robustness of the MIIAD model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RADAR significantly surpasses conventional MIAD methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness on our newly created MIIAD dataset, underscoring its practical application value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailai Feng, Yabo Zhang, Haodong Yu, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Hongzhi Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Artistic typography is a technique to visualize the meaning of input character in an imaginable and readable manner. With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch and training-free method, namely VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography along with controllable geometry change to maintain the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of Subject and Surrounding, followed by rendering them under varying degrees of geometry transformation. The subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions of subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional decomposition detects the part that most matches the subject description and divides input glyph image into subject and surrounding regions. (iii) Typography Stylization firstly refines the structure of subject region via Semantic Typography, and then separately renders the textures of Subject and Surrounding regions through Controllable Compositional Generation. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability, but also manages to depict multiple customize concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzhao Jia, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Tianqing Fang, Zhihan Zhang, Siru Ouyang, Hongming Zhang, Meng Jiang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose \OurMethod, a MLLM designed specifically for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we developed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of the input images. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate our model's superior capabilities in text-rich, multi-image evaluations and competitive performance in general domain evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Hao Chen, Kai Qiu, Jason Kuen, Jiuxiang Gu, Bhiksha Raj, Zhe Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Image tokenizers are crucial for visual generative models, e.g., diffusion models (DMs) and autoregressive (AR) models, as they construct the latent representation for modeling. Increasing token length is a common approach to improve the image reconstruction quality. However, tokenizers with longer token lengths are not guaranteed to achieve better generation quality. There exists a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality regarding token length. In this paper, we investigate the impact of token length on both image reconstruction and generation and provide a flexible solution to the tradeoff. We propose ImageFolder, a semantic tokenizer that provides spatially aligned image tokens that can be folded during autoregressive modeling to improve both generation efficiency and quality. To enhance the representative capability without increasing token length, we leverage dual-branch product quantization to capture different contexts of images. Specifically, semantic regularization is introduced in one branch to encourage compacted semantic information while another branch is designed to capture the remaining pixel-level details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of image generation and shorter token length with ImageFolder tokenizer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu Li, Ruixun Liu, Xiangyong Cao, Deyu Meng, Zhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image plays an irreplaceable role in fields such as agriculture, water resources, military, and disaster relief. Pixel-level interpretation is a critical aspect of remote sensing image applications; however, a prevalent limitation remains the need for extensive manual annotation. For this, we try to introduce open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) into the remote sensing context. However, due to the sensitivity of remote sensing images to low-resolution features, distorted target shapes and ill-fitting boundaries are exhibited in the prediction mask. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and general upsampler, SimFeatUp, to restore lost spatial information in deep features in a training-free style. Further, based on the observation of the abnormal response of local patch tokens to [CLS] token in CLIP, we propose to execute a straightforward subtraction operation to alleviate the global bias in patch tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted on 17 remote sensing datasets spanning semantic segmentation, building extraction, road detection, and flood detection tasks. Our method achieves an average of 5.8%, 8.2%, 4%, and 15.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods on 4 tasks. All codes are released. \url{https://earth-insights.github.io/SegEarth-OV}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Zhang, Yuanhao Wang, Francisco Vicente Carrasco, Chenglei Wu, Jinlong Yang, Thabo Beeler, Fernando De la Torre</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FabricDiffusion, a method for transferring fabric textures from a single clothing image to 3D garments of arbitrary shapes. Existing approaches typically synthesize textures on the garment surface through 2D-to-3D texture mapping or depth-aware inpainting via generative models. Unfortunately, these methods often struggle to capture and preserve texture details, particularly due to challenging occlusions, distortions, or poses in the input image. Inspired by the observation that in the fashion industry, most garments are constructed by stitching sewing patterns with flat, repeatable textures, we cast the task of clothing texture transfer as extracting distortion-free, tileable texture materials that are subsequently mapped onto the UV space of the garment. Building upon this insight, we train a denoising diffusion model with a large-scale synthetic dataset to rectify distortions in the input texture image. This process yields a flat texture map that enables a tight coupling with existing Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) material generation pipelines, allowing for realistic relighting of the garment under various lighting conditions. We show that FabricDiffusion can transfer various features from a single clothing image including texture patterns, material properties, and detailed prints and logos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-to-the-art methods on both synthetic data and real-world, in-the-wild clothing images while generalizing to unseen textures and garment shapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Mai, Peter Hedman, George Kopanas, Dor Verbin, David Futschik, Qiangeng Xu, Falko Kuester, Jon Barron, Yinda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattia Segu, Luigi Piccinelli, Siyuan Li, Yung-Hsu Yang, Bernt Schiele, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple object tracking in complex scenarios - such as coordinated dance performances, team sports, or dynamic animal groups - presents unique challenges. In these settings, objects frequently move in coordinated patterns, occlude each other, and exhibit long-term dependencies in their trajectories. However, it remains a key open research question on how to model long-range dependencies within tracklets, interdependencies among tracklets, and the associated temporal occlusions. To this end, we introduce Samba, a novel linear-time set-of-sequences model designed to jointly process multiple tracklets by synchronizing the multiple selective state-spaces used to model each tracklet. Samba autoregressively predicts the future track query for each sequence while maintaining synchronized long-term memory representations across tracklets. By integrating Samba into a tracking-by-propagation framework, we propose SambaMOTR, the first tracker effectively addressing the aforementioned issues, including long-range dependencies, tracklet interdependencies, and temporal occlusions. Additionally, we introduce an effective technique for dealing with uncertain observations (MaskObs) and an efficient training recipe to scale SambaMOTR to longer sequences. By modeling long-range dependencies and interactions among tracked objects, SambaMOTR implicitly learns to track objects accurately through occlusions without any hand-crafted heuristics. Our approach significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art on the DanceTrack, BFT, and SportsMOT datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prediction of mRNA gene-expression profiles directly from routine whole-slide images (WSIs) using deep learning models could potentially offer cost-effective and widely accessible molecular phenotyping. While such WSI-based gene-expression prediction models have recently emerged within computational pathology, the high-dimensional nature of the corresponding regression problem offers numerous design choices which remain to be analyzed in detail. This study provides recommendations on how deep regression models should be trained for WSI-based gene-expression prediction. For example, we conclude that training a single model to simultaneously regress all 20530 genes is a computationally efficient yet very strong baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Hamza Sharif, Dmitry Demidov, Asif Hanif, Mohammad Yaqub, Min Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution images are preferable in medical imaging domain as they significantly improve the diagnostic capability of the underlying method. In particular, high resolution helps substantially in improving automatic image segmentation. However, most of the existing deep learning-based techniques for medical image segmentation are optimized for input images having small spatial dimensions and perform poorly on high-resolution images. To address this shortcoming, we propose a parallel-in-branch architecture called TransResNet, which incorporates Transformer and CNN in a parallel manner to extract features from multi-resolution images independently. In TransResNet, we introduce Cross Grafting Module (CGM), which generates the grafted features, enriched in both global semantic and low-level spatial details, by combining the feature maps from Transformer and CNN branches through fusion and self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we use these grafted features in the decoding process, increasing the information flow for better prediction of the segmentation mask. Extensive experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TransResNet achieves either state-of-the-art or competitive results on several segmentation tasks, including skin lesion, retinal vessel, and polyp segmentation.

<p>Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains play a vital role in a pathologist's analysis of medical images, providing crucial diagnostic information for various diseases. Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Major retinal layer segmentation methods from OCT images assume that the retina is flattened in advance, and thus cannot always deal with retinas that have changes in retinal structure due to ophthalmopathy and/or curvature due to myopia. To eliminate the use of flattening in retinal layer segmentation for practicality of such methods, we propose novel data augmentation methods for OCT images. Formula-driven data augmentation (FDDA) emulates a variety of retinal structures by vertically shifting each column of the OCT images according to a given mathematical formula. We also propose partial retinal layer copying (PRLC) that copies a part of the retinal layers and pastes it into a region outside the retinal layers. Through experiments using the OCT MS and Healthy Control dataset and the Duke Cyst DME dataset, we demonstrate that the use of FDDA and PRLC makes it possible to detect the boundaries of retinal layers without flattening even retinal layer segmentation methods that assume flattening of the retina.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences), Rashid Iqbal (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: Monkeypox (MPox) has emerged as a significant global concern, with cases steadily increasing daily. Conventional detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and manual examination, exhibit challenges of low sensitivity, high cost, and substantial workload. Therefore, deep learning offers an automated solution; however, the datasets include data scarcity, texture, contrast, inter-intra class variability, and similarities with other skin infectious diseases. In this regard, a novel hybrid approach is proposed that integrates the learning capacity of Residual Learning and Spatial Exploitation Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a customized Swin Transformer (RS-FME-SwinT) to capture multi-scale global and local correlated features for MPox diagnosis. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT technique employs a transfer learning-based feature map enhancement (FME) technique, integrating the customized SwinT for global information capture, residual blocks for texture extraction, and spatial blocks for local contrast variations. Moreover, incorporating new inverse residual blocks within the proposed SwinT effectively captures local patterns and mitigates vanishing gradients. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT has strong learning potential of diverse features that systematically reduce intra-class MPox variation and enable precise discrimination from other skin diseases. Finally, the proposed RS-FME-SwinT is a holdout cross-validated on a diverse MPox dataset and achieved outperformance on state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT demonstrates commendable results of an accuracy of 97.80%, sensitivity of 96.82%, precision of 98.06%, and an F-score of 97.44% in MPox detection. The RS-FME-SwinT could be a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners, enabling prompt and accurate MPox diagnosis and contributing significantly to mitigation efforts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-life robot navigation involves more than just reaching a destination; it requires optimizing movements while addressing scenario-specific goals. An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.</p>

This is a significant evolution over previous models which could produce reasonable facsimiles of the training data, but ones which could be visually distinguished from the training data by human evaluation. Recent work on OOD detection has raised doubts that generative model likelihoods are optimal OOD detectors due to issues involving likelihood misestimation, entropy in the generative process, and typicality. We speculate that generative OOD detectors also failed because their models focused on the pixels rather than the semantic content of the data, leading to failures in near-OOD cases where the pixels may be similar but the information content is significantly different. We hypothesize that estimating typical sets using self-supervised learners leads to better OOD detectors. We introduce a novel approach that leverages representation learning, and informative summary statistics based on manifold estimation, to address all of the aforementioned issues. Our method outperforms other unsupervised approaches and achieves state-of-the art performance on well-established challenging benchmarks, and new synthetic data detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Garcia, Shizhe Chen, Cordelia Schmid</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizing language-conditioned robotic policies to new tasks remains a significant challenge, hampered by the lack of suitable simulation benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing GemBench, a novel benchmark to assess generalization capabilities of vision-language robotic manipulation policies. GemBench incorporates seven general action primitives and four levels of generalization, spanning novel placements, rigid and articulated objects, and complex long-horizon tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art approaches on GemBench and also introduce a new method. Our approach 3D-LOTUS leverages rich 3D information for action prediction conditioned on language. While 3D-LOTUS excels in both efficiency and performance on seen tasks, it struggles with novel tasks. To address this, we present 3D-LOTUS++, a framework that integrates 3D-LOTUS's motion planning capabilities with the task planning capabilities of LLMs and the object grounding accuracy of VLMs. 3D-LOTUS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel tasks of GemBench, setting a new standard for generalization in robotic manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naoki Ide, Tomohiro Kawahara, Hiroshi Ueno, Daiki Yanagidaira, Susumu Takatsuka</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for underwater cameras that monitor the condition of offshore structures and check the number of individuals in aqua culture environments with long-period observation. One of the significant issues with this observation is that biofouling sticks to the aperture and lens densely and prevents cameras from capturing clear images. This study examines an underwater camera that applies material technologies with high inherent resistance to biofouling and computer vision technologies based on image reconstruction by deep learning to lens-less cameras. For this purpose, our prototype camera uses a coded aperture with 1k rectangular shape pinholes in a thin metal plate, such as copper, which hinder the growth of biofouling and keep the surface clean. Although images taken by lens-less cameras are usually not well formed due to lack of the traditional glass-based lens, a deep learning approach using ViT (Vision Transformer) has recently demonstrated reconstructing original photo images well and our study shows that using gated MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) also yields good results. On the other hand, a certain degree of thickness for bio-repellence materials is required to exhibit their effect the thickness of aperture is necessary to use apertures sufficiently thinner than the size of the pinholes to avoid unintentional reflection and absorption on the sidewalls. Therefore, we prepared a sufficiently thin plate for image reconstruction and now currently we conduct tests of the lens-less camera of the bio-repellence aperture with actual seawater environments to determine whether it can sufficiently demonstrate the biofouling effect compared with usual camera with only waterproof.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renkai Wu, Xianjin Wang, Pengchen Liang, Zhenyu Zhang, Qing Chang, Hao Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has profoundly influenced current forms of minimally invasive surgery. However, in transurethral suburethral urological surgical robots, they need to work in a liquid environment. This causes vaporization of the liquid when shearing and heating is performed, resulting in bubble atomization that affects the visual perception of the robot. This can lead to the need for uninterrupted pauses in the surgical procedure, which makes the surgery take longer. To address the atomization characteristics of liquids under urological surgical robotic vision, we propose an unsupervised zero-shot dehaze method (RSF-Dehaze) for urological surgical robotic vision. Specifically, the proposed Region Similarity Filling Module (RSFM) of RSF-Dehaze significantly improves the recovery of blurred region tissues. In addition, we organize and propose a dehaze dataset for robotic vision in urological surgery (USRobot-Dehaze dataset). In particular, this dataset contains the three most common urological surgical robot operation scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to organize and propose a publicly available dehaze dataset for urological surgical robot vision. The proposed RSF-Dehaze proves the effectiveness of our method in three urological surgical robot operation scenarios with extensive comparative experiments with 20 most classical and advanced dehazing and image recovery algorithms. The proposed source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wurenkai/RSF-Dehaze .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Safouane El Ghazouali, Umberto Michelucci, Yassin El Hillali, Hichem Nouira</p>
<p>Abstract: Image similarity metrics play an important role in computer vision applications, as they are used in image processing, computer vision and machine learning. Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval, object recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare, astronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and FSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or sensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel image similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being sensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel metric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into vectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors contain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the dependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships within the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively models the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced comparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared to other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms existing similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including noise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle differences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high importance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aidana Massalimova, Florentin Liebmann, Sascha Jecklin, Fabio Carrillo, Farshad Mazda, Philipp F\"urnstahl</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art computer- and robot-assisted surgery systems heavily depend on intraoperative imaging technologies such as CT and fluoroscopy to generate detailed 3D visualization of the patient's anatomy. While imaging techniques are highly accurate, they are based on ionizing radiation and expose patients and clinicians. This study introduces an alternative, radiation-free approach for reconstructing the 3D spine anatomy using RGB-D data. Drawing inspiration from the 3D "mental map" that surgeons form during surgeries, we introduce SurgPointTransformer, a shape completion approach for surgical applications that can accurately reconstruct the unexposed spine regions from sparse observations of the exposed surface.
  Our method involves two main steps: segmentation and shape completion. The segmentation step includes spinal column localization and segmentation, followed by vertebra-wise segmentation. The segmented vertebra point clouds are then subjected to SurgPointTransformer, which leverages an attention mechanism to learn patterns between visible surface features and the underlying anatomy. For evaluation, we utilize an ex-vivo dataset of nine specimens. Their CT data is used to establish ground truth data that were used to compare to the outputs of our methods. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average Chamfer Distance of 5.39, an F-Score of 0.85, an Earth Mover's Distance of 0.011, and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 22.90 dB.
  This study demonstrates the potential of our reconstruction method for 3D vertebral shape completion. It enables 3D reconstruction of the entire lumbar spine and surgical guidance without ionizing radiation or invasive imaging. Our work contributes to computer-aided and robot-assisted surgery, advancing the perception and intelligence of these systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal task specification is essential for enhanced robotic performance, where \textit{Cross-modality Alignment} enables the robot to holistically understand complex task instructions. Directly annotating multimodal instructions for model training proves impractical, due to the sparsity of paired multimodal data. In this study, we demonstrate that by leveraging unimodal instructions abundant in real data, we can effectively teach robots to learn multimodal task specifications. First, we endow the robot with strong \textit{Cross-modality Alignment} capabilities, by pretraining a robotic multimodal encoder using extensive out-of-domain data. Then, we employ two Collapse and Corrupt operations to further bridge the remaining modality gap in the learned multimodal representation. This approach projects different modalities of identical task goal as interchangeable representations, thus enabling accurate robotic operations within a well-aligned multimodal latent space. Evaluation across more than 130 tasks and 4000 evaluations on both simulated LIBERO benchmark and real robot platforms showcases the superior capabilities of our proposed framework, demonstrating significant advantage in overcoming data constraints in robotic learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Liu, Rongjun Ge, Yuting He, Zhan Wu, Chenyu You, Shuo Li, Yang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-ideal measurement computed tomography (NICT), which sacrifices optimal imaging standards for new advantages in CT imaging, is expanding the clinical application scope of CT images. However, with the reduction of imaging standards, the image quality has also been reduced, extremely limiting the clinical acceptability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning for the NICT enhancement in specific scenarios, their high data cost and limited generalizability have become large obstacles. The recent research on the foundation model has brought new opportunities for building a universal NICT enhancement model - bridging the image quality degradation with minimal data cost. However, owing to the challenges in the collection of large pre-training datasets and the compatibility of data variation, no success has been reported. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. It has been pre-trained on a large-scale physical-driven simulation dataset with 3.6 million NICT-ICT image pairs, and is able to directly generalize to the NICT enhancement tasks with various non-ideal settings and body regions. Via the adaptation with few data, it can further achieve professional performance in real-world specific scenarios. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed TAMP has significant potential for promoting the exploration and application of NICT and serving a wider range of medical scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gai Zhang, Xinfeng Zhang, Lv Tang, Yue Li, Kai Zhang, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: For decades, video compression technology has been a prominent research area. Traditional hybrid video compression framework and end-to-end frameworks continue to explore various intra- and inter-frame reference and prediction strategies based on discrete transforms and deep learning techniques. However, the emerging implicit neural representation (INR) technique models entire videos as basic units, automatically capturing intra-frame and inter-frame correlations and obtaining promising performance. INR uses a compact neural network to store video information in network parameters, effectively eliminating spatial and temporal redundancy in the original video. However, in this paper, our exploration and verification reveal that current INR video compression methods do not fully exploit their potential to preserve information. We investigate the potential of enhancing network parameter storage through parameter reuse. By deepening the network, we designed a feasible INR parameter reuse scheme to further improve compression performance. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly enhances the rate-distortion performance of INR video compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Athira J Jacob, Indraneel Borgohain, Teodora Chitiboi, Puneet Sharma, Dorin Comaniciu, Daniel Rueckert</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), considered the gold standard for noninvasive cardiac assessment, is a diverse and complex modality requiring a wide variety of image processing tasks for comprehensive assessment of cardiac morphology and function. Advances in deep learning have enabled the development of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models for these tasks. However, model training is challenging due to data and label scarcity, especially in the less common imaging sequences. Moreover, each model is often trained for a specific task, with no connection between related tasks. In this work, we introduce a vision foundation model trained for CMR assessment, that is trained in a self-supervised fashion on 36 million CMR images. We then finetune the model in supervised way for 9 clinical tasks typical to a CMR workflow, across classification, segmentation, landmark localization, and pathology detection. We demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness across all tasks, over a range of available labeled dataset sizes. We also demonstrate improved few-shot learning with fewer labeled samples, a common challenge in medical image analyses. We achieve an out-of-box performance comparable to SoTA for most clinical tasks. The proposed method thus presents a resource-efficient, unified framework for CMR assessment, with the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning-based solutions for image analysis tasks, even with few annotated data available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Various visual foundation models have distinct strengths and weaknesses, both of which can be improved through heterogeneous multi-teacher knowledge distillation without labels, termed "agglomerative models." We build upon this body of work by studying the effect of the teachers' activation statistics, particularly the impact of the loss function on the resulting student model quality. We explore a standard toolkit of statistical normalization techniques to better align the different distributions and assess their effects. Further, we examine the impact on downstream teacher-matching metrics, which motivates the use of Hadamard matrices. With these matrices, we demonstrate useful properties, showing how they can be used for isotropic standardization, where each dimension of a multivariate distribution is standardized using the same scale. We call this technique "PHI Standardization" (PHI-S) and empirically demonstrate that it produces the best student model across the suite of methods studied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sedjro Salomon Hotegni, Sebastian Peitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensive research has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to slight adversarial perturbations$-$small changes to the input data that appear insignificant but cause the model to produce drastically different outputs. In addition to augmenting training data with adversarial examples generated from a specific attack method, most of the current defense strategies necessitate modifying the original model architecture components to improve robustness or performing test-time data purification to handle adversarial attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that strong feature representation learning during training can significantly enhance the original model's robustness. We propose MOREL, a multi-objective feature representation learning approach, encouraging classification models to produce similar features for inputs within the same class, despite perturbations. Our training method involves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive contrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the model encoder and ensure tight clustering. Concurrently, the classifier is motivated to achieve accurate predictions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of DNNs against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, outperforming other methods that similarly require no architectural changes or test-time data purification.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyuan Zhang, Han Qiu, Maosen Zhang, Jun Liu, Bin Chen, Tianwei Zhang, Hewu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapidly increasing number of satellites in space and their enhanced capabilities, the amount of earth observation images collected by satellites is exceeding the transmission limits of satellite-to-ground links. Although existing learned image compression solutions achieve remarkable performance by using a sophisticated encoder to extract fruitful features as compression and using a decoder to reconstruct, it is still hard to directly deploy those complex encoders on current satellites' embedded GPUs with limited computing capability and power supply to compress images in orbit. In this paper, we propose COSMIC, a simple yet effective learned compression solution to transmit satellite images. We first design a lightweight encoder (i.e. reducing FLOPs by $2.6\sim 5\times $) on satellite to achieve a high image compression ratio to save satellite-to-ground links. Then, for reconstructions on the ground, to deal with the feature extraction ability degradation due to simplifying encoders, we propose a diffusion-based model to compensate image details when decoding. Our insight is that satellite's earth observation photos are not just images but indeed multi-modal data with a nature of Text-to-Image pairing since they are collected with rich sensor data (e.g. coordinates, timestamp, etc.) that can be used as the condition for diffusion generation. Extensive experiments show that COSMIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both perceptual and distortion metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Assessment of lesions and their longitudinal progression from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring multiple sclerosis (MS). Machine learning models have demonstrated a great potential for automated MS lesion segmentation. Training such models typically requires large-scale high-quality datasets that are consistently annotated. However, MS imaging datasets are often small, segregated across multiple sites, with different formats (cross-sectional or longitudinal), and diverse annotation styles. This poses a significant challenge to train a unified MS lesion segmentation model. To tackle this challenge, we present SegHeD, a novel multi-dataset multi-task segmentation model that can incorporate heterogeneous data as input and perform all-lesion, new-lesion, as well as vanishing-lesion segmentation. Furthermore, we account for domain knowledge about MS lesions, incorporating longitudinal, spatial, and volumetric constraints into the segmentation model. SegHeD is assessed on five MS datasets and achieves a high performance in all, new, and vanishing-lesion segmentation, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in this field.</p>

To overcome this challenge, we present KOLOMVERSE, an open large-scale image dataset for object detection in the maritime domain by KRISO (Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering). We collected 5,845 hours of video data captured from 21 territorial waters of South Korea. Through an elaborate data quality assessment process, we gathered around 2,151,470 4K resolution images from the video data. This dataset considers various environments: weather, time, illumination, occlusion, viewpoint, background, wind speed, and visibility. The KOLOMVERSE consists of five classes (ship, buoy, fishnet buoy, lighthouse and wind farm) for maritime object detection. The dataset has images of 3840$\times$2160 pixels and to our knowledge, it is by far the largest publicly available dataset for object detection in the maritime domain. We performed object detection experiments and evaluated our dataset on several pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures to show the effectiveness and usefulness of our dataset.

<p>Abstract: Existing gait recognition methods typically identify individuals based on the similarity between probe and gallery samples. However, these methods often neglect the fact that the gallery may not contain identities corresponding to the probes, leading to incorrect recognition.To identify Out-of-Gallery (OOG) gait queries, we propose an Evidence-based Match-status-Aware Gait Recognition (EMA-GR) framework. Inspired by Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), EMA-GR is designed to quantify the uncertainty associated with the match status of recognition. Thus, EMA-GR identifies whether the probe has a counterpart in the gallery. Specifically, we adopt an evidence collector to gather match status evidence from a recognition result pair and parameterize a Dirichlet distribution over the gathered evidence, following the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST). We measure the uncertainty and predict the match status of the recognition results, and thus determine whether the probe is an OOG query.To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to tackle OOG queries in gait recognition. Moreover, EMA-GR is agnostic against gait recognition methods and improves the robustness against OOG queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets with OOG queries, and can also generalize well to other identity-retrieval tasks. Importantly, our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, achieving a 51.26% improvement when the OOG query rate is around 50% on OUMVLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Color vision is essential for human visual perception, but its impact on machine perception is still underexplored. There has been an intensified demand for understanding its role in machine perception for safety-critical tasks such as assistive driving and surgery but lacking suitable datasets. To fill this gap, we curate multipurpose datasets ColorSense, by collecting 110,000 non-trivial human annotations of foreground and background color labels from popular visual recognition benchmarks. To investigate the impact of color vision on machine perception, we assign each image a color discrimination level based on its dominant foreground and background colors and use it to study the impact of color vision on machine perception. We validate the use of our datasets by demonstrating that the level of color discrimination has a dominating effect on the performance of mainstream machine perception models. Specifically, we examine the perception ability of machine vision by considering key factors such as model architecture, training objective, model size, training data, and task complexity. Furthermore, to investigate how color and environmental factors affect the robustness of visual recognition in machine perception, we integrate our ColorSense datasets with image corruptions and perform a more comprehensive visual perception evaluation. Our findings suggest that object recognition tasks such as classification and localization are susceptible to color vision bias, especially for high-stakes cases such as vehicle classes, and advanced mitigation techniques such as data augmentation and so on only give marginal improvement. Our analyses highlight the need for new approaches toward the performance evaluation of machine perception models in real-world applications. Lastly, we present various potential applications of ColorSense such as studying spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binqian Xu, Xiangbo Shu, Jiachao Zhang, Rui Yan, Guo-Sen Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning, relying on effective positive and negative sample pairs, is beneficial to learn informative skeleton representations in unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition. To achieve these positive and negative pairs, existing weak/strong data augmentation methods have to randomly change the appearance of skeletons for indirectly pursuing semantic perturbations. However, such approaches have two limitations: i) solely perturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of skeletons, and ii) randomly perturbation may change the original positive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address the above dilemma, we start the first attempt to explore an attack-based augmentation scheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for constructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard negative pairs. In particular, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation Mixing-Contrastive skeletal representation learning (A$^2$MC) to contrast hard positive features and hard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In A$^2$MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform targeted and untargeted perturbations of skeletons via attack and augmentation respectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features. Meanwhile, Positive-Negative Mixer (PNM) is presented to mix hard positive features and negative features for generating hard negative features, which are adopted for updating the mixed memory banks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that A$^2$MC is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be accessible on A$^2$MC (https://github.com/1xbq1/A2MC).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Ahmadi, Ahmad Gholizadeh Lonbar, Hajar Kazemi Naeini, Ali Tarlani Beris, Mohammadsadegh Nouri, Amir Sharifzadeh Javidi, Abbas Sharifi</p>
<p>Abstract: This research assesses the performance of two deep learning models, SAM and U-Net, for detecting cracks in concrete structures. The results indicate that each model has its own strengths and limitations for detecting different types of cracks. Using the SAM's unique crack detection approach, the image is divided into various parts that identify the location of the crack, making it more effective at detecting longitudinal cracks. On the other hand, the U-Net model can identify positive label pixels to accurately detect the size and location of spalling cracks. By combining both models, more accurate and comprehensive crack detection results can be achieved. The importance of using advanced technologies for crack detection in ensuring the safety and longevity of concrete structures cannot be overstated. This research can have significant implications for civil engineering, as the SAM and U-Net model can be used for a variety of concrete structures, including bridges, buildings, and roads, improving the accuracy and efficiency of crack detection and saving time and resources in maintenance and repair. In conclusion, the SAM and U-Net model presented in this study offer promising solutions for detecting cracks in concrete structures and leveraging the strengths of both models that can lead to more accurate and comprehensive results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shizhan Gong, Yuan Zhong, Wenao Ma, Jinpeng Li, Zhao Wang, Jingyang Zhang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite that the segment anything model (SAM) achieved impressive results on general-purpose semantic segmentation with strong generalization ability on daily images, its demonstrated performance on medical image segmentation is less precise and not stable, especially when dealing with tumor segmentation tasks that involve objects of small sizes, irregular shapes, and low contrast. Notably, the original SAM architecture is designed for 2D natural images, therefore would not be able to extract the 3D spatial information from volumetric medical data effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation method for transferring SAM from 2D to 3D for promptable medical image segmentation. Through a holistically designed scheme for architecture modification, we transfer the SAM to support volumetric inputs while retaining the majority of its pre-trained parameters for reuse. The fine-tuning process is conducted in a parameter-efficient manner, wherein most of the pre-trained parameters remain frozen, and only a few lightweight spatial adapters are introduced and tuned. Regardless of the domain gap between natural and medical data and the disparity in the spatial arrangement between 2D and 3D, the transformer trained on natural images can effectively capture the spatial patterns present in volumetric medical images with only lightweight adaptations. We conduct experiments on four open-source tumor segmentation datasets, and with a single click prompt, our model can outperform domain state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models on 3 out of 4 tasks, specifically by 8.25%, 29.87%, and 10.11% for kidney tumor, pancreas tumor, colon cancer segmentation, and achieve similar performance for liver tumor segmentation. We also compare our adaptation method with existing popular adapters, and observed significant performance improvement on most datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Fan, Laure Vuaille, Hao Wang, Thomas B\"ack</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Engineering Design approaches driven by Deep Generative Models (DGM) have been proposed to facilitate industrial engineering processes. In such processes, designs often come in the form of images, such as blueprints, engineering drawings, and CAD models depending on the level of detail. DGMs have been successfully employed for synthesis of natural images, e.g., displaying animals, human faces and landscapes. However, industrial design images are fundamentally different from natural scenes in that they contain rich structural patterns and long-range dependencies, which are challenging for convolution-based DGMs to generate. Moreover, DGM-driven generation process is typically triggered based on random noisy inputs, which outputs unpredictable samples and thus cannot perform an efficient industrial design exploration. We tackle these challenges by proposing a novel model Self-Attention Adversarial Latent Autoencoder (SA-ALAE), which allows generating feasible design images of complex engineering parts. With SA-ALAE, users can not only explore novel variants of an existing design, but also control the generation process by operating in latent space. The potential of SA-ALAE is shown by generating engineering blueprints in a real automotive design task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Lumin Xu, Shenqi Lai, Wenqi Shao, Nanning Zheng, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image-based keypoint detection methods for animal (including human) bodies and faces are generally divided into full-supervised and few-shot class-agnostic approaches. The former typically relies on laborious and time-consuming manual annotations, posing considerable challenges in expanding keypoint detection to a broader range of keypoint categories and animal species. The latter, though less dependent on extensive manual input, still requires necessary support images with annotation for reference during testing. To realize zero-shot keypoint detection without any prior annotation, we introduce the Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection (OVKD) task, which is innovatively designed to use text prompts for identifying arbitrary keypoints across any species. In pursuit of this goal, we have developed a novel framework named Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection with Semantic-feature Matching (KDSM). This framework synergistically combines vision and language models, creating an interplay between language features and local keypoint visual features. KDSM enhances its capabilities by integrating Domain Distribution Matrix Matching (DDMM) and other special modules, such as the Vision-Keypoint Relational Awareness (VKRA) module, improving the framework's generalizability and overall performance.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KDSM significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of performance and achieves remarkable success in the OVKD task.Impressively, our method, operating in a zero-shot fashion, still yields results comparable to state-of-the-art few-shot species class-agnostic keypoint detection methods.We will make the source code publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Tawfik Aboukhadra, Jameel Malik, Nadia Robertini, Ahmed Elhayek, Didier Stricker</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction of hand-object manipulations is important for emulating human actions. Most methods dealing with challenging object manipulation scenarios, focus on hands reconstruction in isolation, ignoring physical and kinematic constraints due to object contact. Some approaches produce more realistic results by jointly reconstructing 3D hand-object interactions. However, they focus on coarse pose estimation or rely upon known hand and object shapes. We propose the first approach for realistic 3D hand-object shape and pose reconstruction from a single depth map. Unlike previous work, our voxel-based reconstruction network regresses the vertex coordinates of a hand and an object and reconstructs more realistic interaction. Our pipeline additionally predicts voxelized hand-object shapes, having a one-to-one mapping to the input voxelized depth. Thereafter, we exploit the graph nature of the hand and object shapes, by utilizing the recent GraFormer network with positional embedding to reconstruct shapes from template meshes. In addition, we show the impact of adding another GraFormer component that refines the reconstructed shapes based on the hand-object interactions and its ability to reconstruct more accurate object shapes. We perform an extensive evaluation on the HO-3D and DexYCB datasets and show that our method outperforms existing approaches in hand reconstruction and produces plausible reconstructions for the objects</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Keilstrup Ingwersen, Rasmus Tirsgaard, Rasmus Nylander, Janus N{\o}rtoft Jensen, Anders Bjorholm Dahl, Morten Rieger Hannemose</p>
<p>Abstract: Deducing a 3D human pose from a single 2D image or 2D keypoints is inherently challenging, given the fundamental ambiguity wherein multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D representation. The acquisition of 3D data, while invaluable for resolving pose ambiguity, is expensive and requires an intricate setup, often restricting its applicability to controlled lab environments. We improve performance of monocular human pose estimation models using multiview data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel loss function, multiview consistency, to enable adding additional training data with only 2D supervision. This loss enforces that the inferred 3D pose from one view aligns with the inferred 3D pose from another view under similarity transformations. Our consistency loss substantially improves performance for fine-tuning with no available 3D data. Our experiments demonstrate that two views offset by 90 degrees are enough to obtain good performance, with only marginal improvements by adding more views. Thus, we enable the acquisition of domain-specific data by capturing activities with off-the-shelf cameras, eliminating the need for elaborate calibration procedures. This research introduces new possibilities for domain adaptation in 3D pose estimation, providing a practical and cost-effective solution to customize models for specific applications. The used dataset, featuring additional views, will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12870">Unlocking the Potential: Multi-task Deep Learning for Spaceborne Quantitative Monitoring of Fugitive Methane Plumes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxin Si, Shiliang Fu, Wei Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: As global warming intensifies, increased attention is being paid to monitoring fugitive methane emissions and detecting gas plumes from landfills. We have divided methane emission monitoring into three subtasks: methane concentration inversion, plume segmentation, and emission rate estimation. Traditional algorithms face certain limitations: methane concentration inversion typically employs the matched filter, which is sensitive to the global spectrum distribution and prone to significant noise. There is scant research on plume segmentation, with many studies depending on manual segmentation, which can be subjective. The estimation of methane emission rate frequently uses the IME algorithm, which necessitates meteorological measurement data. Utilizing the WENT landfill site in Hong Kong along with PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery, we introduce a novel deep learning-based framework for quantitative methane emission monitoring from remote sensing images that is grounded in physical simulation. We create simulated methane plumes using large eddy simulation (LES) and various concentration maps of fugitive emissions using the radiative transfer equation (RTE), while applying augmentation techniques to construct a simulated PRISMA dataset. We train a U-Net network for methane concentration inversion, a Mask R-CNN network for methane plume segmentation, and a ResNet-50 network for methane emission rate estimation. All three deep networks yield higher validation accuracy compared to traditional algorithms. Furthermore, we combine the first two subtasks and the last two subtasks to design multi-task learning models, MTL-01 and MTL-02, both of which outperform single-task models in terms of accuracy. Our research exemplifies the application of multi-task deep learning to quantitative methane monitoring and can be generalized to a wide array of methane monitoring tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxuan Liu, Jiankai Tang, Yongli Chen, Haoxiang Li, Jiahao Qi, Siwei Li, Kegang Wang, Jie Gan, Yuntao Wang, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can help camera-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) in measuring cardiac activity and physiological signals from facial videos, such as pulse wave, heart rate and respiration rate with better accuracy. However, most existing ANN-based methods require substantial computing resources, which poses challenges for effective deployment on mobile devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), on the other hand, hold immense potential for energy-efficient deep learning owing to their binary and event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce SNNs into the realm of rPPG, proposing a hybrid neural network (HNN) model, the Spiking-PhysFormer, aimed at reducing power consumption. Specifically, the proposed Spiking-PhyFormer consists of an ANN-based patch embedding block, SNN-based transformer blocks, and an ANN-based predictor head. First, to simplify the transformer block while preserving its capacity to aggregate local and global spatio-temporal features, we design a parallel spike transformer block to replace sequential sub-blocks. Additionally, we propose a simplified spiking self-attention mechanism that omits the value parameter without compromising the model's performance. Experiments conducted on four datasets-PURE, UBFC-rPPG, UBFC-Phys, and MMPD demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 12.4\% reduction in power consumption compared to PhysFormer. Additionally, the power consumption of the transformer block is reduced by a factor of 12.2, while maintaining decent performance as PhysFormer and other ANN-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Yang, Xinyu Gao, Yangtian Sun, Yihua Huang, Xiaoyang Lyu, Wen Zhou, Shaohui Jiao, Xiaojuan Qi, Xiaogang Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have not only facilitated real-time rendering through modern GPU rasterization pipelines but have also attained state-of-the-art rendering quality. Nevertheless, despite its exceptional rendering quality and performance on standard datasets, 3D-GS frequently encounters difficulties in accurately modeling specular and anisotropic components. This issue stems from the limited ability of spherical harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Spec-Gaussian, an approach that utilizes an anisotropic spherical Gaussian (ASG) appearance field instead of SH for modeling the view-dependent appearance of each 3D Gaussian. Additionally, we have developed a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve learning efficiency and eliminate floaters caused by overfitting in real-world scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of rendering quality. Thanks to ASG, we have significantly improved the ability of 3D-GS to model scenes with specular and anisotropic components without increasing the number of 3D Gaussians. This improvement extends the applicability of 3D GS to handle intricate scenarios with specular and anisotropic surfaces. Project page is https://ingra14m.github.io/Spec-Gaussian-website/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Novendra Setyawan, Ghufron Wahyu Kurniawan, Chi-Chia Sun, Jun-Wei Hsieh, Jing-Ming Guo, Wen-Kai Kuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks. However, their deep architectures often lead to high computational redundancy, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices. This paper introduces ParFormer, a novel vision transformer that addresses this challenge by incorporating a Parallel Mixer and a Sparse Channel Attention Patch Embedding (SCAPE). By combining convolutional and attention mechanisms, ParFormer improves feature extraction. This makes spatial feature extraction more efficient and cuts down on unnecessary computation. The SCAPE module further reduces computational redundancy while preserving essential feature information during down-sampling. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset show that ParFormer-T achieves 78.9\% Top-1 accuracy with a high throughput on a GPU that outperforms other small models with 2.56$\times$ higher throughput than MobileViT-S, 0.24\% faster than FasterNet-T2, and 1.79$\times$ higher than EdgeNeXt-S. For edge device deployment, ParFormer-T excels with a throughput of 278.1 images/sec, which is 1.38 $\times$ higher than EdgeNeXt-S and 2.36$\times$ higher than MobileViT-S, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in resource-constrained settings. The larger variant, ParFormer-L, reaches 83.5\% Top-1 accuracy, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, surpassing many state-of-the-art models. In COCO object detection, ParFormer-M achieves 40.7 AP for object detection and 37.6 AP for instance segmentation, surpassing models like ResNet-50, PVT-S and PoolFormer-S24 with significantly higher efficiency. These results validate ParFormer as a highly efficient and scalable model for both high-performance and resource-constrained scenarios, making it an ideal solution for edge-based AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Yang, Zijie Pan, Chun Gu, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D generation are predominantly propelled by improvements in 3D-aware image diffusion models. These models are pretrained on Internet-scale image data and fine-tuned on massive 3D data, offering the capability of producing highly consistent multi-view images. However, due to the scarcity of synchronized multi-view video data, it remains challenging to adapt this paradigm to 4D generation directly. Despite that, the available video and 3D data are adequate for training video and multi-view diffusion models separately that can provide satisfactory dynamic and geometric priors respectively. To take advantage of both, this paper presents Diffusion$^2$, a novel framework for dynamic 3D content creation that reconciles the knowledge about geometric consistency and temporal smoothness from these models to directly sample dense multi-view multi-frame images which can be employed to optimize continuous 4D representation. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective denoising strategy via score composition of pretrained video and multi-view diffusion models based on the probability structure of the target image array. To alleviate the potential conflicts between two heterogeneous scores, we further introduce variance-reducing sampling via interpolated steps, facilitating smooth and stable generation. Owing to the high parallelism of the proposed image generation process and the efficiency of the modern 4D reconstruction pipeline, our framework can generate 4D content within few minutes. Notably, our method circumvents the reliance on expensive and hard-to-scale 4D data, thereby having the potential to benefit from the scaling of the foundation video and multi-view diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in generating highly seamless and consistent 4D assets under various types of conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Liu, Kezhao Liu, Yao Xiao, Ziyi Dong, Xiaogang Xu, Pengxu Wei, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-Based Purification (DBP) has emerged as an effective defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. The efficacy of DBP has been attributed to the forward diffusion process, which narrows the distribution gap between clean and adversarial images through the addition of Gaussian noise. Although this explanation has some theoretical support, the significance of its contribution to robustness remains unclear. In this paper, we argue that the inherent stochasticity in the DBP process is the primary driver of its robustness. To explore this, we introduce a novel Deterministic White-Box (DW-box) evaluation protocol to assess robustness in the absence of stochasticity and to analyze the attack trajectories and loss landscapes. Our findings suggest that DBP models primarily leverage stochasticity to evade effective attack directions, and their ability to purify adversarial perturbations can be weak. To further enhance the robustness of DBP models, we introduce Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Training (ADDT), which incorporates classifier-guided adversarial perturbations into diffusion training, thereby strengthening the DBP models' ability to purify adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we propose Rank-Based Gaussian Mapping (RBGM) to make perturbations more compatible with diffusion models. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of ADDT. In conclusion, our study suggests that future research on DBP can benefit from the perspective of decoupling the stochasticity-based and purification-based robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui, Muhammad Umer Sheikh, Hassan Abid, Muhammad Haris Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging large-scale pre-training, vision foundational models showcase notable performance benefits. Recent segmentation algorithms for natural scenes have advanced significantly. However, existing models still struggle to automatically segment personalized instances in dense and crowded scenarios, where severe occlusions, scale variations, and background clutter pose a challenge to accurately delineate densely packed instances of the target object. To address this, we propose PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. We develop a new baseline capable of automatically generating instance-level point prompts via proposing a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps, encapsulating spatial distribution of objects in an image. To mitigate false positives within generated point prompts, we design Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM). Both IDM and PPSM transform density maps into personalized precise point prompts for instance-level segmentation and offer a seamless integration in our model-agnostic framework. We also introduce a feedback mechanism which enables PerSense to improve the accuracy of density maps by automating the exemplar selection process for density map generation. To promote algorithmic advances and effective tools for this relatively underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, a diverse dataset exclusive to personalized instance segmentation in dense images. Our extensive experiments establish PerSense superiority in dense scenarios by achieving an mIoU of 71.61% on PerSense-D, outperforming recent SOTA models by significant margins of +47.16%, +42.27%, +8.83%, and +5.69%. Additionally, our qualitative findings demonstrate the adaptability of our framework to images captured in-the-wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malika Nisal Ratnayake, Lex Gallon, Adel N. Toosi, Alan Dorin</p>
<p>Abstract: Field-captured video facilitates detailed studies of spatio-temporal aspects of animal locomotion, decision-making and environmental interactions including predator-prey relationships and habitat utilisation. But even though data capture is cheap with mass-produced hardware, storage, processing and transmission overheads provide a hurdle to acquisition of high resolution video from field-situated edge computing devices. Efficient compression algorithms are therefore essential if monitoring is to be conducted on single-board computers in situations where such hurdles must be overcome. Animal motion tracking in the field has unique characteristics that necessitate the use of novel video compression techniques, which may be underexplored or unsuitable in other contexts. In this article, we therefore introduce a new motion analysis-based video compression algorithm specifically designed for camera traps. We implemented and tested this algorithm using a case study of insect-pollinator motion tracking on three popular edge computing platforms. The algorithm identifies and stores only image regions depicting motion relevant to pollination monitoring, reducing overall data size by an average of 87% across diverse test datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to preserve critical information for insect behaviour analysis through both manual observation and automatic analysis of the compressed footage. The method presented in this paper enhances the applicability of low-powered computer vision edge devices to remote, in situ animal motion monitoring, and improves the efficiency of playback during behavioural analyses. Our new software, EcoMotionZip, is available Open Access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manoj Kumar, Neil Houlsby, Emiel Hoogeboom</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating image variations, where a model produces variations of an input image while preserving the semantic context has gained increasing attention. Current image variation techniques involve adapting a text-to-image model to reconstruct an input image conditioned on the same image. We first demonstrate that a diffusion model trained to reconstruct an input image from frozen embeddings, can reconstruct the image with minor variations. Second, inspired by how text-to-image models learn from web-scale text-image pairs, we explore a new pretraining strategy to generate image variations using a large collection of image pairs. Our diffusion model \textit{Semantica} receives a random (encoded) image from a webpage as conditional input and denoises another noisy random image from the same webpage. We carefully examine various design choices for the image encoder, given its crucial role in extracting relevant context from the input image. Once trained, \textit{Semantica} can adaptively generate new images from a dataset by simply using images from that dataset as input. Finally, we identify limitations in standard image consistency metrics for evaluating image variations and propose alternative metrics based on few-shot generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Nguyen, Matthew Wallingford, Sebastin Santy, Wei-Chiu Ma, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Pang Wei Koh, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abisek Rajakumar Kalarani, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Sumit Shekhar</p>
<p>Abstract: Metaphors are a common communication tool used in our day-to-day life. The detection and generation of metaphors in textual form have been studied extensively but metaphors in other forms have been under-explored. Recent studies have shown that Vision-Language (VL) models cannot understand visual metaphors in memes and adverts. As of now, no probing studies have been done that involve complex language phenomena like metaphors with videos. Hence, we introduce a new VL task of describing the metaphors present in the videos in our work. To facilitate this novel task, we construct and release a manually created dataset with 705 videos and 2115 human-written captions, along with a new metric called Average Concept Distance (ACD), to automatically evaluate the creativity of the metaphors generated. We also propose a novel low-resource video metaphor captioning system: GIT-LLaVA, which obtains comparable performance to SoTA video language models on the proposed task. We perform a comprehensive analysis of existing video language models on this task and publish our dataset, models, and benchmark results to enable further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Kai Qiu, Hao Chen, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional visual generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of diffusion models (DMs), especially in tasks like control-to-image generation. However, challenges such as expensive computational cost, high inference latency, and difficulties of integration with large language models (LLMs) have necessitated exploring alternatives to DMs. This paper introduces ControlVAR, a novel framework that explores pixel-level controls in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling for flexible and efficient conditional generation. In contrast to traditional conditional models that learn the conditional distribution, ControlVAR jointly models the distribution of image and pixel-level conditions during training and imposes conditional controls during testing. To enhance the joint modeling, we adopt the next-scale AR prediction paradigm and unify control and image representations. A teacher-forcing guidance strategy is proposed to further facilitate controllable generation with joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy and flexibility of ControlVAR across various conditional generation tasks against popular conditional DMs, \eg, ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Lee, Boyang Li, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning, or supervised finetuning on extensive task-specific data, is necessary for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generalize well across a broad range of vision-language (VL) tasks. However, training on large VL datasets can become prohibitively expensive. In this work, we introduce COINCIDE, an effective and scalable data selection technique that uses a small model as a reference model to select visual instruction tuning data for efficient finetuning of a target LVLM, focusing on diversity and transferability. Specifically, we cluster the training data using internal activations from a small model, which identifies VL concept-skill compositions needed by a target LVLM. We then sample data from these diverse clusters by considering their density and transferability, or the ability to transfer well to other concept-skill compositions. This approach ensures the diversity of these compositions, which is vital for LVLM generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COINCIDE achieves superior performance and data selection efficiency against 8 strong baselines on two distinct datasets: LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan. Using only 20% of the LLaVA-1.5 dataset, COINCIDE achieves performance comparable to the LVLM finetuned on the whole dataset, with 70% reduction of the wall-clock running time. On the Vision-Flan dataset, our method achieves superior results with only 16.7% of the training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghai Yuan, Jinfa Huang, Yongqi Xu, Yaoyang Liu, Shaofeng Zhang, Yujun Shi, Ruijie Zhu, Xinhua Cheng, Jiebo Luo, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation benchmark, ChronoMagic-Bench, to evaluate the temporal and metamorphic capabilities of the T2V models (e.g. Sora and Lumiere) in time-lapse video generation. In contrast to existing benchmarks that focus on visual quality and textual relevance of generated videos, ChronoMagic-Bench focuses on the model's ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text query. For these purposes, ChronoMagic-Bench introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human-created, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories. This categorization comprehensively evaluates the model's capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations. To accurately align human preference with the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence. MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity. Based on ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of ten representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, and providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research. Moreover, we create a large-scale ChronoMagic-Pro dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions ensuring high physical pertinence and large metamorphic amplitude.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daiwei Zhang, Gengyan Li, Jiajie Li, Micka\"el Bressieux, Otmar Hilliges, Marc Pollefeys, Luc Van Gool, Xi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human activities are inherently complex, often involving numerous object interactions. To better understand these activities, it is crucial to model their interactions with the environment captured through dynamic changes. The recent availability of affordable head-mounted cameras and egocentric data offers a more accessible and efficient means to understand human-object interactions in 3D environments. However, most existing methods for human activity modeling neglect the dynamic interactions with objects, resulting in only static representations. The few existing solutions often require inputs from multiple sources, including multi-camera setups, depth-sensing cameras, or kinesthetic sensors. To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the first method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically tracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the uniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions from the background, with both having explicit representations. Our approach employs a clip-level online learning pipeline that leverages the dynamic nature of human activities, allowing us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the scene in chronological order and track rigid object motion. EgoGaussian shows significant improvements in terms of both dynamic object and background reconstruction quality compared to the state-of-the-art. We also qualitatively demonstrate the high quality of the reconstructed models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongzhen Zhao, Vivienne Wang, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Similar to humans perceiving visual scenes as objects, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) can abstract dense images or videos into sparse object-level features. Transformer-based OCL handles complex textures well due to the decoding guidance of discrete representation, obtained by discretizing noisy features in image or video feature maps using template features from a codebook. However, treating features as minimal units overlooks their composing attributes, thus impeding model generalization; indexing features with natural numbers loses attribute-level commonalities and characteristics, thus diminishing heuristics for model convergence. We propose \textit{Grouped Discrete Representation} (GDR) to address these issues by grouping features into attributes and indexing them with tuple numbers. In extensive experiments across different query initializations, dataset modalities, and model architectures, GDR consistently improves convergence and generalizability. Visualizations show that our method effectively captures attribute-level information in features. The source code will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixiang Chen, Lei Wang, Piotr Koniusz, Tom Gedeon</p>
<p>Abstract: Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information. Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to modulate motion signals from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest. We show that our lightweight, plug-and-play motion prompt layer seamlessly integrates into models like SlowFast, X3D, and TimeSformer, enhancing performance on benchmarks such as FineGym and MPII Cooking 2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongseok Hyun, Su Ho Han, Hyolim Kang, Joon-Young Lee, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: The vocabulary size in temporal action localization (TAL) is limited by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To overcome this, recent works integrate vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, despite the success of VLMs trained on extensive datasets, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on human-labeled TAL datasets of limited size to train action localizers, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos, and (2) the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is then used to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwook Kim, Seonho Lee, Jaeyo Shin, Jiho Choi, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Edge detection (ED) is a base task in computer vision. While the performance of the ED algorithm has been improved greatly by introducing CNN-based models, current models still suffer from unsatisfactory precision rates especially when only a low error toleration distance is allowed. Therefore, model architecture for more precise predictions still needs an investigation. On the other hand, the unavoidable noise training data provided by humans would lead to unsatisfactory model predictions even when inputs are edge maps themselves, which also needs a solution. In this paper, more precise ED models are presented with cascaded skipping density blocks (CSDB). Our models obtain state-of-the-art(SOTA) predictions in several datasets, especially in average precision rate (AP), over a high-standard benchmark, which is confirmed by extensive experiments. Also, a novel modification on data augmentation for training is employed, which allows noiseless data to be employed in model training for the first time, and thus further improves the model performance.

<p>Abstract: Elasmobranchs (shark sand rays) represent a critical component of marine ecosystems. Yet, they are experiencing global population declines and effective monitoring of populations is essential to their protection. Underwater stationary videos, such as those from Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS), are critical for understanding elasmobranch spatial ecology and abundance. However, processing these videos requires time-consuming manual analysis that can delay conservation. To address this challenge, we developed SharkTrack, a semi-automatic underwater video analysis software. SharkTrack uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Object Tracking to automatically detect and track elasmobranchs and provides an annotation pipeline to manually classify elasmobranch species and compute species-specific MaxN (ssMaxN), the standard metric of relative abundance. When tested on BRUVS footage from locations unseen by the CNN model during training, SharkTrack computed ssMaxN with 89% accuracy over 207 hours of footage. The semi-automatic SharkTrack pipeline required two minutes of manual classification per hour of video, an estimated 95% reduction of manual analysis time compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SharkTrack accuracy across diverse marine ecosystems and elasmobranch species, an advancement compared to previous models, which were limited to specific species or locations. SharkTrack applications extend beyond BRUVS, facilitating the analysis of any underwater stationary video. By making video analysis faster and more accessible, SharkTrack enables research and conservation organisations to monitor elasmobranch populations more efficiently, thereby improving conservation efforts. To further support these goals, we provide public access to the SharkTrack software.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinically deployed deep learning-based segmentation models are known to fail on data outside of their training distributions. While clinicians review the segmentations, these models tend to perform well in most instances, which could exacerbate automation bias. Therefore, detecting out-of-distribution images at inference is critical to warn the clinicians that the model likely failed. This work applied the Mahalanobis distance (MD) post hoc to the bottleneck features of four Swin UNETR and nnU-net models that segmented the liver on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. By reducing the dimensions of the bottleneck features with either principal component analysis or uniform manifold approximation and projection, images the models failed on were detected with high performance and minimal computational load. In addition, this work explored a non-parametric alternative to the MD, a k-th nearest neighbors distance (KNN). KNN drastically improved scalability and performance over MD when both were applied to raw and average-pooled bottleneck features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Yicheng Zhu, Keren Ye, Junjie Ke, Jiahui Yu, Leonidas Guibas, Peyman Milanfar, Feng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing and disentangling visual attributes from objects is a foundation to many computer vision applications. While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).</p>

<p>Abstract: We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a scene representation and propose a novel test-time camera pose refinement framework, GSLoc. This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GSLoc obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GSLoc enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mouxiang Chen, Lefei Shen, Zhuo Li, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Chenghao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting visual models may offer a ``free lunch'' for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated powerful zero-shot segmentation performance in natural scenes. The recently released Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has further heightened researchers' expectations towards image segmentation capabilities. To evaluate the performance of SAM2 on class-agnostic instance-level segmentation tasks, we adopt different prompt strategies for SAM2 to cope with instance-level tasks for three relevant scenarios: Salient Instance Segmentation (SIS), Camouflaged Instance Segmentation (CIS), and Shadow Instance Detection (SID). In addition, to further explore the effectiveness of SAM2 in segmenting granular object structures, we also conduct detailed tests on the high-resolution Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) benchmark to assess the fine-grained segmentation capability. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results indicate that the performance of SAM2 varies significantly across different scenarios. Besides, SAM2 is not particularly sensitive to segmenting high-resolution fine details. We hope this technique report can drive the emergence of SAM2-based adapters, aiming to enhance the performance ceiling of large vision models on class-agnostic instance segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongzhen Zhao, Vivienne Wang, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents dense image or video pixels as sparse object features. Representative methods utilize discrete representation composed of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) template features to suppress pixel-level information redundancy and guide object-level feature aggregation. The most recent advancement, Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR), further decomposes these template features into attributes. However, its naive channel grouping as decomposition may erroneously group channels belonging to different attributes together and discretize them as sub-optimal template attributes, which losses information and harms expressivity. We propose Organized GDR (OGDR) to organize channels belonging to the same attributes together for correct decomposition from features into attributes. In unsupervised segmentation experiments, OGDR is fully superior to GDR in augmentating classical transformer-based OCL methods; it even improves state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones. Codebook PCA and representation similarity analyses show that compared with GDR, our OGDR eliminates redundancy and preserves information better for guiding object representation learning. The source code is available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhang Shang, Bingxin Xu, Weitai Kang, Mu Cai, Yuheng Li, Zehao Wen, Zhen Dong, Kurt Keutzer, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Tongyu Zong, Yueyu Hu, Yao Wang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Field-of-View (FoV) adaptive streaming significantly reduces bandwidth requirement of immersive point cloud video (PCV) by only transmitting visible points in a viewer's FoV. The traditional approaches often focus on trajectory-based 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) FoV predictions. The predicted FoV is then used to calculate point visibility. Such approaches do not explicitly consider video content's impact on viewer attention, and the conversion from FoV to point visibility is often error-prone and time-consuming. We reformulate the PCV FoV prediction problem from the cell visibility perspective, allowing for precise decision-making regarding the transmission of 3D data at the cell level based on the predicted visibility distribution. We develop a novel spatial visibility and object-aware graph model that leverages the historical 3D visibility data and incorporates spatial perception, neighboring cell correlation, and occlusion information to predict the cell visibility in the future. Our model significantly improves the long-term cell visibility prediction, reducing the prediction MSE loss by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art models while maintaining real-time performance (more than 30fps) for point cloud videos with over 1 million points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salaheldin Mohamed, Dong Han, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly advanced the development of artificial intelligence, enabling the generation of high-quality images in diverse contexts based on specific text prompts. However, existing T2I-based methods often struggle to accurately reproduce the appearance of individuals from a reference image and to create novel representations of those individuals in various settings. To address this, we leverage the pre-trained UNet from Stable Diffusion to incorporate the target face image directly into the generation process. Our approach diverges from prior methods that depend on fixed encoders or static face embeddings, which often fail to bridge encoding gaps. Instead, we capitalize on UNet's sophisticated encoding capabilities to process reference images across multiple scales. By innovatively altering the cross-attention layers of the UNet, we effectively fuse individual identities into the generative process. This strategic integration of facial features across various scales not only enhances the robustness and consistency of the generated images but also facilitates efficient multi-reference and multi-identity generation. Our method sets a new benchmark in identity-preserving image generation, delivering state-of-the-art results in similarity metrics while maintaining prompt alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yize Li, Yihua Zhang, Sijia Liu, Xue Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable generation capabilities of Diffusion Models (DMs), conducting training and inference remains computationally expensive. Previous works have been devoted to accelerating diffusion sampling, but achieving data-efficient diffusion training has often been overlooked. In this work, we investigate efficient diffusion training from the perspective of dataset pruning. Inspired by the principles of data-efficient training for generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), we first extend the data selection scheme used in GANs to DM training, where data features are encoded by a surrogate model, and a score criterion is then applied to select the coreset. To further improve the generation performance, we employ a class-wise reweighting approach, which derives class weights through distributionally robust optimization (DRO) over a pre-trained reference DM. For a pixel-wise DM (DDPM) on CIFAR-10, experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methodology over existing approaches and its effectiveness in image synthesis comparable to that of the original full-data model while achieving the speed-up between 2.34 times and 8.32 times. Additionally, our method could be generalized to latent DMs (LDMs), e.g., Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT) and Stable Diffusion (SD), and achieves competitive generation capability on ImageNet.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Yeh, You-Ming Chang, Wei-Chen Chiu, Ning Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the risks of encountering inappropriate or harmful content, researchers managed to incorporate several harmful contents datasets with machine learning methods to detect harmful concepts. However, existing harmful datasets are curated by the presence of a narrow range of harmful objects, and only cover real harmful content sources. This hinders the generalizability of methods based on such datasets, potentially leading to misjudgments. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive harmful dataset, Visual Harmful Dataset 11K (VHD11K), consisting of 10,000 images and 1,000 videos, crawled from the Internet and generated by 4 generative models, across a total of 10 harmful categories covering a full spectrum of harmful concepts with nontrivial definition. We also propose a novel annotation framework by formulating the annotation process as a multi-agent Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, having 3 different VLMs "debate" about whether the given image/video is harmful, and incorporating the in-context learning strategy in the debating process. Therefore, we can ensure that the VLMs consider the context of the given image/video and both sides of the arguments thoroughly before making decisions, further reducing the likelihood of misjudgments in edge cases. Evaluation and experimental results demonstrate that (1) the great alignment between the annotation from our novel annotation framework and those from human, ensuring the reliability of VHD11K; (2) our full-spectrum harmful dataset successfully identifies the inability of existing harmful content detection methods to detect extensive harmful contents and improves the performance of existing harmfulness recognition methods; (3) VHD11K outperforms the baseline dataset, SMID, as evidenced by the superior improvement in harmfulness recognition methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Wang, Yifan Sun, Zhentao Tan, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Images produced by diffusion models are increasingly popular in digital artwork and visual marketing. However, such generated images might replicate content from existing ones and pose the challenge of content originality. Existing Image Copy Detection (ICD) models, though accurate in detecting hand-crafted replicas, overlook the challenge from diffusion models. This motivates us to introduce ICDiff, the first ICD specialized for diffusion models. To this end, we construct a Diffusion-Replication (D-Rep) dataset and correspondingly propose a novel deep embedding method. D-Rep uses a state-of-the-art diffusion model (Stable Diffusion V1.5) to generate 40, 000 image-replica pairs, which are manually annotated into 6 replication levels ranging from 0 (no replication) to 5 (total replication). Our method, PDF-Embedding, transforms the replication level of each image-replica pair into a probability density function (PDF) as the supervision signal. The intuition is that the probability of neighboring replication levels should be continuous and smooth. Experimental results show that PDF-Embedding surpasses protocol-driven methods and non-PDF choices on the D-Rep test set. Moreover, by utilizing PDF-Embedding, we find that the replication ratios of well-known diffusion models against an open-source gallery range from 10% to 20%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junming Wang, Wei Yin, Xiaoxiao Long, Xingyu Zhang, Zebin Xing, Xiaoyang Guo, Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction networks have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reconstructing the geometric and semantic structure of 3D scenes, providing crucial information for robot navigation and autonomous driving systems. However, due to their large overhead from dense network structure designs, existing networks face challenges balancing accuracy and latency. In this paper, we introduce OccRWKV, an efficient semantic occupancy network inspired by Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV). OccRWKV separates semantics, occupancy prediction, and feature fusion into distinct branches, each incorporating Sem-RWKV and Geo-RWKV blocks. These blocks are designed to capture long-range dependencies, enabling the network to learn domain-specific representation (i.e., semantics and geometry), which enhances prediction accuracy. Leveraging the sparse nature of real-world 3D occupancy, we reduce computational overhead by projecting features into the bird's-eye view (BEV) space and propose a BEV-RWKV block for efficient feature enhancement and fusion. This enables real-time inference at 22.2 FPS without compromising performance. Experiments demonstrate that OccRWKV outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving a mIoU of 25.1 while being 20 times faster than the best baseline, Co-Occ, making it suitable for real-time deployment on robots to enhance autonomous navigation efficiency.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20018">Visual Context Window Extension: A New Perspective for Long Video Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchen Wei, Zhenzhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in short video understanding tasks but face great challenges when applied to long video understanding. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit outstanding capabilities in modeling long texts. Existing work attempts to address this issue by introducing long video-text pairs during training. However, these approaches require substantial computational and data resources. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of long video understanding from the perspective of context windows, aiming to apply LMMs to long video tasks without retraining on long video datasets. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of why pretrained LMMs struggle to understand lengthy video content, identifying that discrepancies between visual and language modalities lead to different context windows for visual and language tokens, making it difficult to directly extend the visual tokens to match the language context window. Based on this, we propose to adapt LMMs for long video understanding tasks by extending the visual context window, eliminating the need for retraining on large scalelong video datasets. To further mitigate the significant memory consumption caused by long sequences, we introduce a progressive pooling inference strategy that selectively adjusts the spatial resolution of frame embeddings, reducing the number of visual tokens while retaining important spatial information. Across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, our method consistently improves the performance as the number of video frames increases. On the MLVU benchmark, our method outperforms GPT-4o, even though our model size is only 7B. Additionally, in the 256-frame setting, our method reduces memory usage by approximately 45% compared to the baseline, without introducing any performance loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Zhao, Alison Wun-lam Yeung, Ali Muhammad, Songjiang Lai, Vincent To-Yee NG</p>
<p>Abstract: Under high-intensity rail operations, rail tracks endure considerable stresses resulting in various defects such as corrugation and spellings. Failure to effectively detect defects and provide maintenance in time would compromise service reliability and public safety. While advanced models have been developed in recent years, efficiently identifying small-scale rail defects has not yet been studied, especially for categories such as Dirt or Squat on rail surface. To address this challenge, this study utilizes Swin Transformer (SwinT) as baseline and incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for enhancement. Our proposed method integrates CBAM successively within the swin transformer blocks, resulting in significant performance improvement in rail defect detection, particularly for categories with small instance sizes. The proposed framework is named CBAM-Enhanced Swin Transformer in Block Level (CBAM-SwinT-BL). Experiment and ablation study have proven the effectiveness of the framework. The proposed framework has a notable improvement in the accuracy of small size defects, such as dirt and dent categories in RIII dataset, with mAP-50 increasing by +23.0% and +38.3% respectively, and the squat category in MUET dataset also reaches +13.2% higher than the original model. Compares to the original SwinT, CBAM-SwinT-BL increase overall precision around +5% in the MUET dataset and +7% in the RIII dataset, reaching 69.1% and 88.1% respectively. Meanwhile, the additional module CBAM merely extend the model training speed by an average of +0.04s/iteration, which is acceptable compared to the significant improvement in system performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is pivotal in robotics, with photorealistic scene reconstruction emerging as a key challenge. To address this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that optimizes training, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing photorealistic scene representation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Jha, Shiqi Yang, Masato Ishii, Mengjie Zhao, Christian Simon, Muhammad Jehanzeb Mirza, Dong Gong, Lina Yao, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image diffusion models have grown popular for their ability to efficiently acquire a new concept from user-defined text descriptions and a few images. However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines. Finally, by operating in the replay-free CL setup and on low-rank adapters, our method incurs zero storage and parameter overhead, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junlin Han, Jianyuan Wang, Andrea Vedaldi, Philip Torr, Filippos Kokkinos</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D content from text, single images, or sparse view images remains a challenging task with broad applications. Existing methods typically employ multi-view diffusion models to synthesize multi-view images, followed by a feed-forward process for 3D reconstruction. However, these approaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views, limiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading to suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality. To address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework capable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The first stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We employ a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion model to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of the target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these views based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and reliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated views are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a transformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of inputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane representation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation. Through extensive exploration of design and training strategies, we optimize FlexRM to achieve superior performance in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Flex3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a user study winning rate of over 92% in 3D generation tasks when compared to several of the latest feed-forward 3D generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Schlosser, Frederik Beuth, Trixy Meyer, Arunodhayan Sampath Kumar, Gabriel Stolze, Olga Furashova, Katrin Engelmann, Danny Kowerko</p>
<p>Abstract: In ophthalmology, intravitreal operative medication therapy (IVOM) is a widespread treatment for diseases related to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the diabetic macular edema (DME), as well as the retinal vein occlusion (RVO). However, in real-world settings, patients often suffer from loss of vision on time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the prediction of the visual acuity (VA) and the earliest possible detection of deterioration under real-life conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous and incomplete data. In this contribution, we present a workflow for the development of a research-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of the department of ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The extensive data corpus allows predictive statements of the expected progression of a patient and his or her VA in each of the three diseases. For the disease AMD, we found out a significant deterioration of the visual acuity over time. Within our proposed multistage system, we subsequently classify the VA progression into the three groups of therapy "winners", "stabilizers", and "losers" (WSL classification scheme). Our OCT biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks results in a classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to complete incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a more precise VA modeling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA examinations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict the VA progression within a forecasted time frame, whereas our prediction is currently restricted to IVOM / no therapy. We achieve a final prediction accuracy of 69 % in macro average F1-score, while being in the same range as the ophthalmologists with 57.8 and 50 +- 10.7 % F1-score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim Kadry, Abhishek Karmakar, Andreas Schuh, Kersten Peterson, Michiel Schaap, David Marlevi, Charles Taylor, Elazer Edelman, Farhad Nezami</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) provides 3D information on obstructive coronary artery disease, but cannot fully visualize high-resolution features within the vessel wall. Intravascular imaging, in contrast, can spatially resolve atherosclerotic in cross sectional slices, but is limited in capturing 3D relationships between each slice. Co-registering CCTA and intravascular images enables a variety of clinical research applications but is time consuming and user-dependent. This is due to intravascular images suffering from non-rigid distortions arising from irregularities in the imaging catheter path. To address these issues, we present a morphology-based framework for the rigid and non-rigid matching of intravascular images to CCTA images. To do this, we find the optimal virtual catheter path that samples the coronary artery in CCTA image space to recapitulate the coronary artery morphology observed in the intravascular image. We validate our framework on a multi-center cohort of 40 patients using bifurcation landmarks as ground truth for longitudinal and rotational registration. Our registration approach significantly outperforms other approaches for bifurcation alignment. By providing a differentiable framework for multi-modal vascular co-registration, our framework reduces the manual effort required to conduct large-scale multi-modal clinical studies and enables the development of machine learning-based co-registration approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhentao Liu, Yu Fang, Changjian Li, Han Wu, Yuan Liu, Dinggang Shen, Zhiming Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) plays a vital role in clinical imaging. Traditional methods typically require hundreds of 2D X-ray projections to reconstruct a high-quality 3D CBCT image, leading to considerable radiation exposure. This has led to a growing interest in sparse-view CBCT reconstruction to reduce radiation doses. While recent advances, including deep learning and neural rendering algorithms, have made strides in this area, these methods either produce unsatisfactory results or suffer from time inefficiency of individual optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometry-aware encoder-decoder framework to solve this problem. Our framework starts by encoding multi-view 2D features from various 2D X-ray projections with a 2D CNN encoder. Leveraging the geometry of CBCT scanning, it then back-projects the multi-view 2D features into the 3D space to formulate a comprehensive volumetric feature map, followed by a 3D CNN decoder to recover 3D CBCT image. Importantly, our approach respects the geometric relationship between 3D CBCT image and its 2D X-ray projections during feature back projection stage, and enjoys the prior knowledge learned from the data population. This ensures its adaptability in dealing with extremly sparse view inputs without individual training, such as scenarios with only 5 or 10 X-ray projections. Extensive evaluations on two simulated datasets and one real-world dataset demonstrate exceptional reconstruction quality and time efficiency of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Xiaodan Li, Cen Chen, Wenmeng Zhou, Yaliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: A prevailing belief in attack and defense community is that the higher flatness of adversarial examples enables their better cross-model transferability, leading to a growing interest in employing sharpness-aware minimization and its variants. However, the theoretical relationship between the transferability of adversarial examples and their flatness has not been well established, making the belief questionable. To bridge this gap, we embark on a theoretical investigation and, for the first time, derive a theoretical bound for the transferability of adversarial examples with few practical assumptions. Our analysis challenges this belief by demonstrating that the increased flatness of adversarial examples does not necessarily guarantee improved transferability. Moreover, building upon the theoretical analysis, we propose TPA, a Theoretically Provable Attack that optimizes a surrogate of the derived bound to craft adversarial examples. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmark datasets and various real-world applications show that TPA can craft more transferable adversarial examples compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We hope that these results can recalibrate preconceived impressions within the community and facilitate the development of stronger adversarial attack and defense mechanisms.

<p>Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique with extensive clinical applications in ophthalmology. OCT enables the visualization of the retinal layers, playing a vital role in the early detection and monitoring of retinal diseases. OCT uses the principle of light wave interference to create detailed images of the retinal microstructures, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing ocular conditions. This work presents an open-access OCT dataset (OCTDL) comprising over 2000 OCT images labeled according to disease group and retinal pathology. The dataset consists of OCT records of patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Epiretinal Membrane (ERM), Retinal Artery Occlusion (RAO), Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), and Vitreomacular Interface Disease (VID). The images were acquired with an Optovue Avanti RTVue XR using raster scanning protocols with dynamic scan length and image resolution. Each retinal b-scan was acquired by centering on the fovea and interpreted and cataloged by an experienced retinal specialist. In this work, we applied Deep Learning classification techniques to this new open-access dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Emanuele Cin\`a, Francesco Villani, Maura Pintor, Lea Sch\"onherr, Battista Biggio, Marcello Pelillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating the adversarial robustness of deep networks to gradient-based attacks is challenging. While most attacks consider $\ell_2$- and $\ell_\infty$-norm constraints to craft input perturbations, only a few investigate sparse $\ell_1$- and $\ell_0$-norm attacks. In particular, $\ell_0$-norm attacks remain the least studied due to the inherent complexity of optimizing over a non-convex and non-differentiable constraint. However, evaluating adversarial robustness under these attacks could reveal weaknesses otherwise left untested with more conventional $\ell_2$- and $\ell_\infty$-norm attacks. In this work, we propose a novel $\ell_0$-norm attack, called $\sigma$-zero, which leverages a differentiable approximation of the $\ell_0$ norm to facilitate gradient-based optimization, and an adaptive projection operator to dynamically adjust the trade-off between loss minimization and perturbation sparsity. Extensive evaluations using MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets, involving robust and non-robust models, show that $\sigma$-zero finds minimum $\ell_0$-norm adversarial examples without requiring any time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, and that it outperforms all competing sparse attacks in terms of success rate, perturbation size, and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Sun, Malcolm Mielle, Achim J. Lilienthal, Martin Magnusson</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a dense RGBD SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that provides metrically accurate pose tracking and visually realistic reconstruction. To this end, we first propose a Gaussian densification strategy based on the rendering loss to map unobserved areas and refine reobserved areas. Second, we introduce extra regularization parameters to alleviate the forgetting problem in the continuous mapping problem, where parameters tend to overfit the latest frame and result in decreasing rendering quality for previous frames. Both mapping and tracking are performed with Gaussian parameters by minimizing re-rendering loss in a differentiable way. Compared to recent neural and concurrently developed gaussian splatting RGBD SLAM baselines, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the synthetic dataset Replica and competitive results on the real-world dataset TUM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Heppert, Max Argus, Tim Welschehold, Thomas Brox, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Teaching robots new skills quickly and conveniently is crucial for the broader adoption of robotic systems. In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording. We propose a two-stage process. In the first stage we extract the demonstration trajectory offline. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. In the online trajectory generation stage, we first re-detect all objects, then warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene and execute it on the robot. To complete these steps, our method leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect and quantitatively test on demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Sharma, Bojing Liu, Mattias Rantalainen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashu Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation technology has the potential to expedite pathological diagnoses, thereby enhancing the efficiency of patient care. However, medical images often have complex textures and structures, and the models often face the problem of reduced image resolution and information loss due to downsampling. To address this issue, we propose HC-Mamba, a new medical image segmentation model based on the modern state space model Mamba. Specifically, we introduce the technique of dilated convolution in the HC-Mamba model to capture a more extensive range of contextual information without increasing the computational cost by extending the perceptual field of the convolution kernel. In addition, the HC-Mamba model employs depthwise separable convolutions, significantly reducing the number of parameters and the computational power of the model. By combining dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolutions, HC-Mamba is able to process large-scale medical image data at a much lower computational cost while maintaining a high level of performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on segmentation tasks including organ segmentation and skin lesion, and conduct extensive experiments on Synapse, ISIC17 and ISIC18 to demonstrate the potential of the HC-Mamba model in medical image segmentation. The experimental results show that HC-Mamba exhibits competitive performance on all these datasets, thereby proving its effectiveness and usefulness in medical image segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wu, Lutao Yan, Leixian Shen, Yunhai Wang, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart question answering (ChartQA) tasks play a critical role in interpreting and extracting insights from visualization charts. While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o have shown promise in high-level ChartQA tasks, such as chart captioning, their effectiveness in low-level ChartQA tasks (e.g., identifying correlations) remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating MLLMs on low-level ChartQA using a newly curated dataset, ChartInsights, which consists of 22,347 (chart, task, query, answer) covering 10 data analysis tasks across 7 chart types. We systematically evaluate 19 advanced MLLMs, including 12 open-source and 7 closed-source models. The average accuracy rate across these models is 39.8%, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy at 69.17%. To further explore the limitations of MLLMs in low-level ChartQA, we conduct experiments that alter visual elements of charts (e.g., changing color schemes, adding image noise) to assess their impact on the task effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a new textual prompt strategy, Chain-of-Charts, tailored for low-level ChartQA tasks, which boosts performance by 14.41%, achieving an accuracy of 83.58%. Finally, incorporating a visual prompt strategy that directs attention to relevant visual elements further improves accuracy to 84.32%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The study of associations between an individual's age and imaging and non-imaging data is an active research area that attempts to aid understanding of the effects and patterns of aging. In this work we have conducted a supervoxel-wise association study between both volumetric and tissue density features in coronary computed tomography angiograms and the chronological age of a subject, to understand the localized changes in morphology and tissue density with age. To enable a supervoxel-wise study of volume and tissue density, we developed a novel method based on image segmentation, inter-subject image registration, and robust supervoxel-based correlation analysis, to achieve a statistical association study between the images and age. We evaluate the registration methodology in terms of the Dice coefficient for the heart chambers and myocardium, and the inverse consistency of the transformations, showing that the method works well in most cases with high overlap and inverse consistency. In a sex-stratified study conducted on a subset of $n=1388$ images from the SCAPIS study, the supervoxel-wise analysis was able to find localized associations with age outside of the commonly segmented and analyzed sub-regions, and several substantial differences between the sexes in the association of age and volume.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutao Feng, Yintong Shang, Xiang Feng, Lei Lan, Shandian Zhe, Tianjia Shao, Hongzhi Wu, Kun Zhou, Hao Su, Chenfanfu Jiang, Yin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ElastoGen, a knowledge-driven AI model that generates physically accurate 4D elastodynamics. Unlike deep models that learn from video- or image-based observations, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics and learns from established mathematical and optimization procedures. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the differential equation, corresponding to the nonlinear force equilibrium, into a series of iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit deep architectures. We carefully build our network module following this overarching design philosophy. ElastoGen is much more lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale than deep generative models. Because of its alignment with actual physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Offergeld, Marcel van Gerven, Nasir Ahmad</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We identify that, for effective node pruning, this subspace must be constructed using a triangular transformation matrix, a transformation which is equivalent to and unnormalized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimised to maximally reduce node activations in our subspace and thereby form a more optimal ranking of nodes. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our proposed method reaches state of the art when pruning ImageNet trained VGG-16 and rivals more complex state of the art methods when pruning ResNet-50 networks across a range of pruning ratios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahraa Al Sahili, Ioannis Patras, Matthew Purver</p>
<p>Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in diffusion models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models (LLMs). FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement and attire-based attribute prediction to systematically mitigate biases, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across multiple models, including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly improves fairness and diversity metrics without compromising image quality or relevance. Our approach advances ethical AI practices in generative modeling, promoting socially responsible content generation and setting new standards for fairness in AI-generated imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyuan Wei, Fanjiang Ye, Ori Yonay, Xingyu Chen, Baixi Sun, Dingwen Tao, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing studies of training state-of-the-art Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models on large-scale data involve hundreds of or even thousands of GPUs due to the requirement of a large batch size. However, such a large amount of resources is not accessible to most people. While advanced compositional optimization techniques for optimizing global contrastive losses have been demonstrated effective for removing the requirement of large batch size, their performance on large-scale data remains underexplored and not optimized. To bridge the gap, this paper explores several aspects of CLIP training with limited resources (e.g., up to tens of GPUs). First, we introduce FastCLIP, a general CLIP training framework built on advanced compositional optimization techniques while designed and optimized for the distributed setting. Our framework is equipped with an efficient gradient reduction strategy to reduce communication overhead. Second, to further boost training efficiency, we investigate three components of the framework from an optimization perspective: the schedule of the inner learning rate, the update rules of the temperature parameter and the model parameters, respectively. Experiments on different strategies for each component shed light on how to conduct CLIP training more efficiently. Finally, we benchmark the performance of FastCLIP and the state-of-the-art training baseline (OpenCLIP) on different compute scales up to 32 GPUs on 8 nodes, and three data scales ranging from 2.7 million, 9.1 million to 315 million image-text pairs to demonstrate the significant improvement of FastCLIP in the resource-limited setting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kien X. Nguyen, Fengchun Qiao, Xi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of continual test-time adaption where the goal is to adapt a source pre-trained model to a sequence of unlabelled target domains at test time. Existing methods on test-time training suffer from several limitations: (1) Mismatch between the feature extractor and classifier; (2) Interference between the main and self-supervised tasks; (3) Lack of the ability to quickly adapt to the current distribution. In light of these challenges, we propose a cascading paradigm that simultaneously updates the feature extractor and classifier at test time, mitigating the mismatch between them and enabling long-term model adaptation. The pre-training of our model is structured within a meta-learning framework, thereby minimizing the interference between the main and self-supervised tasks and encouraging fast adaptation in the presence of limited unlabelled data. Additionally, we introduce innovative evaluation metrics, average accuracy and forward transfer, to effectively measure the model's adaptation capabilities in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach in a range of tasks including image classification, text classification, and speech recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mona Schirmer, Dan Zhang, Eric Nalisnick</p>
<p>Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Sashank Dorbala, Vishnu Dutt Sharma, Pratap Tokekar, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new method for improving zero-shot ObjectNav that aims to utilize potentially available environmental percepts for navigational assistance. Our approach takes into account that the ground agent may have limited and sometimes obstructed view. Our formulation encourages Generative Communication (GC) between an assistive overhead agent with a global view containing the target object and the ground agent with an obfuscated view; both equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for vision-to-language translation. In this assisted setup, the embodied agents communicate environmental information before the ground agent executes actions towards a target. Despite the overhead agent having a global view with the target, we note a drop in performance (-13% in OSR and -13% in SPL) of a fully cooperative assistance scheme over an unassisted baseline. In contrast, a selective assistance scheme where the ground agent retains its independent exploratory behaviour shows a 10% OSR and 7.65% SPL improvement. To explain navigation performance, we analyze the GC for unique traits, quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. Specifically, we identify the novel linguistic trait of preemptive hallucination in our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move, and note its strong correlation with navigation performance. We conduct real-world experiments and present some qualitative examples where we mitigate hallucinations via prompt finetuning to improve ObjectNav performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs)-critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vighnesh Birodkar, Gabriel Barcik, James Lyon, Sergey Ioffe, David Minnen, Joshua V. Dillon</p>
<p>Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the efficacy of jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Guo, Darui Lu, Gregory Szumel, Rongze Gui, Tingyu Wang, Nicholas Konz, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: Medical images acquired using different scanners and protocols can differ substantially in their appearance. This phenomenon, scanner domain shift, can result in a drop in the performance of deep neural networks which are trained on data acquired by one scanner and tested on another. This significant practical issue is well-acknowledged, however, no systematic study of the issue is available across different modalities and diagnostic tasks. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we present a broad experimental study evaluating the impact of scanner domain shift on convolutional neural network performance for different automated diagnostic tasks. We evaluate this phenomenon in common radiological modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. Results: We find that network performance on data from a different scanner is almost always worse than on same-scanner data, and we quantify the degree of performance drop across different datasets. Notably, we find that this drop is most severe for MRI, moderate for X-ray, and quite small for CT, on average, which we attribute to the standardized nature of CT acquisition systems which is not present in MRI or X-ray. We also study how injecting varying amounts of target domain data into the training set, as well as adding noise to the training data, helps with generalization. Conclusion: Our results provide extensive experimental evidence and quantification of the extent of performance drop caused by scanner domain shift in deep learning across different modalities, with the goal of guiding the future development of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based speech generators are ubiquitous. These methods can generate very high quality synthetic speech and several recent incidents report their malicious use. To counter such misuse, synthetic speech detectors have been developed. Many of these detectors are trained on datasets which do not include diffusion-based synthesizers. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing detectors trained on one such dataset, ASVspoof2019, do not perform well in detecting synthetic speech from recent diffusion-based synthesizers. We propose the Diffusion-Based Synthetic Speech Dataset (DiffSSD), a dataset consisting of about 200 hours of labeled speech, including synthetic speech generated by 8 diffusion-based open-source and 2 commercial generators. We also examine the performance of existing synthetic speech detectors on DiffSSD in both closed-set and open-set scenarios. The results highlight the importance of this dataset in detecting synthetic speech generated from recent open-source and commercial speech generators.</p>

We find that in the autoPETIII dataset, a model that is trained on the entire dataset exhibits undesirable characteristics by producing a large number of false positives particularly for PSMA-PETs. We counteract this by removing the easiest samples from the training dataset as measured by the model loss before retraining from scratch. Using the proposed approach we manage to drive down the false negative volume and improve upon the baseline model in both false negative volume and dice score on the preliminary test set.

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, "What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?" To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning! {What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16434">Lessons Learned from a Unifying Empirical Study of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) in Visual Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheda Mai, Ping Zhang, Cheng-Hao Tu, Hong-You Chen, Li Zhang, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has attracted significant attention lately, due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of approaches. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which approach to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully fine-tuned model can better balance target (i.e., downstream) distribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.</p>
