<p><b>Authors:</b> Mees M. Flapper, Elian Bernard, Sander G. Huisman</p>
<p>Abstract: A method for particle orientation tracking is developed and demonstrated specifically for anisotropic particles. Using (high-speed) multi-camera recordings of anisotropic particles from different viewpoints, we reconstruct the 3D location and orientation of these particles using their known shape. This paper describes an algorithm which tracks the location and orientation of multiple anisotropic particles over time, enabling detailed investigations of location, orientation, and rotation statistics. The robustness and error of this method is quantified, and we explore the effects of noise, image size, the number of used cameras, and the camera arrangement by applying the algorithm to synthetic images. We showcase several use-cases of this method in several experiments (in both quiescent and turbulent fluids), demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of the described tracking method. The proposed method is shown to work for widely different particle shapes, successfully tracks multiple particles simultaneously, and the method can distinguish between different types of particles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Posso, Hugo Kieffer, Nicolas Menga, Omar Hlimi, S\'ebastien Tarris, Hubert Guerard, Guy Bois, Matthieu Couderc, Eric Jenn</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a lightweight U-Net model optimized for real-time semantic segmentation of aerial images, targeting the efficient utilization of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) embedded computing platforms. We maintain the accuracy of the U-Net on a real-world dataset while significantly reducing the model's parameters and Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations by a factor of 16. Our comprehensive analysis covers three hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, and FPGA) and five different toolchains (TVM, FINN, Vitis AI, TensorFlow GPU, and cuDNN), assessing each on metrics such as latency, power consumption, memory footprint, energy efficiency, and FPGA resource usage. The results highlight the trade-offs between these platforms and toolchains, with a particular focus on the practical deployment challenges in real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate that while the FPGA with Vitis AI emerges as the superior choice due to its performance, energy efficiency, and maturity, it requires specialized hardware knowledge, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach in selecting embedded computing solutions for semantic segmentation tasks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Qin, Ruobing Zheng, Yabing Wang, Tianqi Li, Zixin Zhu, Minghui Yang, Ming Yang, Le Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human animation from a single reference image shall be flexible to synthesize whole-body motion for either a headshot or whole-body portrait, where the motions are readily controlled by audio signal and text prompts. This is hard for most existing methods as they only support producing pre-specified head or half-body motion aligned with audio inputs. In this paper, we propose a versatile human animation method, i.e., VersaAnimator, which generates whole-body talking human from arbitrary portrait images, not only driven by audio signal but also flexibly controlled by text prompts. Specifically, we design a text-controlled, audio-driven motion generator that produces whole-body motion representations in 3D synchronized with audio inputs while following textual motion descriptions. To promote natural smooth motion, we propose a code-pose translation module to link VAE codebooks with 2D DWposes extracted from template videos. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal video diffusion that generates photorealistic human animation from a reference image according to both audio inputs and whole-body motion representations. Extensive experiments show that VersaAnimator outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aviad Barzilai, Yotam Gigi, Vered Silverman, Yehonathan Refael, Bolous Jaber, Amr Helmy, Tomer Shekel, George Leifman, Genady Beryozkin</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have had a significant impact across various AI applications, enabling use cases that were previously impossible. Contrastive Visual Language Models (VLMs), in particular, have outperformed other techniques in many tasks. However, their prevalence in remote sensing (RS) is still limited, due to the scarcity of diverse remote-sensing visual-language datasets. In this work we introduce two novel image-caption datasets for training of remote sensing foundation models. The first dataset pairs aerial and satellite imagery with captions generated by Gemini using landmarks extracted from Google Maps. The second dataset utilizes public web images and their corresponding alt-text, filtered for the remote sensing domain, resulting in a diverse dataset with greater breadth in image styles and subject matter. These datasets are used to pre-train the MaMMUT~\citep{kuo2023mammutsimplearchitecturejoint} VLM architecture, resulting in state-of-the-art generalization performance in zero-shot cross-modal retrieval on well-known public benchmarks. Finally, we present our ongoing research to distill image-level knowledge gained in the VLM contrastive training procedure to enhance the model's localization ability. Specifically, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels for image regions based on the model's attention maps and use these labels for further training. To mitigate noisy attention maps and create robust segmentation masks, we introduce a novel attention-pooling mechanism called the Smooth-Attention-Operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyyed Mohammad Sadegh Moosavi Khorzooghi, Poojitha Thota, Mohit Singhal, Abolfazl Asudeh, Gautam Das, Shirin Nilizadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: The lack of a common platform and benchmark datasets for evaluating face obfuscation methods has been a challenge, with every method being tested using arbitrary experiments, datasets, and metrics. While prior work has demonstrated that face recognition systems exhibit bias against some demographic groups, there exists a substantial gap in our understanding regarding the fairness of face obfuscation methods. Providing fair face obfuscation methods can ensure equitable protection across diverse demographic groups, especially since they can be used to preserve the privacy of vulnerable populations. To address these gaps, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework, named FairDeFace, designed to assess the adversarial robustness and fairness of face obfuscation methods. The framework introduces a set of modules encompassing data benchmarks, face detection and recognition algorithms, adversarial models, utility detection models, and fairness metrics. FairDeFace serves as a versatile platform where any face obfuscation method can be integrated, allowing for rigorous testing and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. In its current implementation, FairDeFace incorporates 6 attacks, and several privacy, utility and fairness metrics. Using FairDeFace, and by conducting more than 500 experiments, we evaluated and compared the adversarial robustness of seven face obfuscation methods. This extensive analysis led to many interesting findings both in terms of the degree of robustness of existing methods and their biases against some gender or racial groups. FairDeFace also uses visualization of focused areas for both obfuscation and verification attacks to show not only which areas are mostly changed in the obfuscation process for some demographics, but also why they failed through focus area comparison of obfuscation and verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In Cho, Youngbeom Yoo, Subin Jeon, Seon Joo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing a compressed latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE) is the key for efficient 3D diffusion models. This paper introduces COD-VAE, a VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08741">Oasis: One Image is All You Need for Multimodal Instruction Data Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Zhang, Quan Cui, Bingchen Zhao, Cheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has been largely attributed to the large-scale training data. However, the training data of many MLLMs is unavailable due to privacy concerns. The expensive and labor-intensive process of collecting multi-modal data further exacerbates the problem. Is it possible to synthesize multi-modal training data automatically without compromising diversity and quality? In this paper, we propose a new method, Oasis, to synthesize high-quality multi-modal data with only images. Oasis breaks through traditional methods by prompting only images to the MLLMs, thus extending the data diversity by a large margin. Our method features a delicate quality control method which ensures the data quality. We collected over 500k data and conducted incremental experiments on LLaVA-NeXT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of MLLMs. The image-based synthesis also allows us to focus on the specific-domain ability of MLLMs. Code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Wang, Zhipeng Zhang, Baao Xie, Xin Jin, Yunbo Wang, Shiyu Wang, Liaomo Zheng, Xiaokang Yang, Wenjun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Training visual reinforcement learning (RL) in practical scenarios presents a significant challenge, $\textit{i.e.,}$ RL agents suffer from low sample efficiency in environments with variations. While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentanglement representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikey Shechter, Yair Carmon</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Filter Like You Test (FLYT), a method for curating large-scale vision-language datasets that learns the usefulness of each data point as a pretraining example. FLYT trains a scoring model that learns to weigh each example using gradient signals from downstream tasks training sets. Using the same training methodology, we develop Mixing-FLYT (M-FLYT), which takes the per-example scores generated by different scoring methods and learns to unify them into a single score. Our training methodology naturally produces a distribution over the training examples, which we leverage through Soft Cap Sampling (SCS), a strategy for obtaining a filtered pretraining dataset from per-example probabilities that samples examples while preventing over-representation through a repetition penalty. Using all three methods, we achieve 40.1% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy on the DataComp medium scale filtering benchmark, a 1.9% absolute accuracy increase over all previous results and a 5.5% increase over results that -- like us -- use only public resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajitha de Silva, Jonathan Cox, Marija Popovic, Cesar Cadena, Cyrill Stachniss, Riccardo Polvara</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust robot navigation in outdoor environments requires accurate perception systems capable of handling visual challenges such as repetitive structures and changing appearances. Visual feature matching is crucial to vision-based pipelines but remains particularly challenging in natural outdoor settings due to perceptual aliasing. We address this issue in vineyards, where repetitive vine trunks and other natural elements generate ambiguous descriptors that hinder reliable feature matching. We hypothesise that semantic information tied to keypoint positions can alleviate perceptual aliasing by enhancing keypoint descriptor distinctiveness. To this end, we introduce a keypoint semantic integration technique that improves the descriptors in semantically meaningful regions within the image, enabling more accurate differentiation even among visually similar local features. We validate this approach in two vineyard perception tasks: (i) relative pose estimation and (ii) visual localisation. Across all tested keypoint types and descriptors, our method improves matching accuracy by 12.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness over multiple months in challenging vineyard conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Hosseini, Sumit Nawathe, Mazda Moayeri, Sriram Balasubramanian, Soheil Feizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Unimodal vision models are known to rely on spurious correlations, but it remains unclear to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit similar biases despite language supervision. In this paper, we investigate spurious bias in MLLMs and introduce SpurLens, a pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and open-set object detectors to automatically identify spurious visual cues without human supervision. Our findings reveal that spurious correlations cause two major failure modes in MLLMs: (1) over-reliance on spurious cues for object recognition, where removing these cues reduces accuracy, and (2) object hallucination, where spurious cues amplify the hallucination by over 10x. We validate our findings in various MLLMs and datasets. Beyond diagnosing these failures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling and reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root causes of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious correlations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwen Chen, Wenhui Zhu, Peijie Qiu, Hao Wang, Huayu Li, Haiyu Wu, Aristeidis Sotiras, Yalin Wang, Abolfazl Razi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangyu Jin, Andrew Feng, Ankur Chemburkar, Celso M. De Melo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PromptGAR, a novel framework that addresses the limitations of current Group Activity Recognition (GAR) approaches by leveraging multi-modal prompts to achieve both input flexibility and high recognition accuracy. The existing approaches suffer from limited real-world applicability due to their reliance on full prompt annotations, the lack of long-term actor consistency, and under-exploration of multi-group scenarios. To bridge the gap, we proposed PromptGAR, which is the first GAR model to provide input flexibility across prompts, frames, and instances without the need for retraining. Specifically, we unify bounding boxes, skeletal keypoints, and areas as point prompts and employ a recognition decoder for cross-updating class and prompt tokens. To ensure long-term consistency for extended activity durations, we also introduce a relative instance attention mechanism that directly encodes instance IDs. Finally, PromptGAR explores the use of area prompts to enable the selective recognition of the particular group activity within videos that contain multiple concurrent groups. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PromptGAR achieves competitive performances both on full prompts and diverse prompt inputs, establishing its effectiveness on input flexibility and generalization ability for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Luiz dos Santos Canuto, Linnyer Beatrys Ruiz Aylon, Rodrigo Clemente Thom de Souza</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their effective performance, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures have become the standard for solving computer vision tasks. Such architectures require large data sets and rely on convolution and self-attention operations. In 2021, MLP-Mixer emerged, an architecture that relies only on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and achieves extremely competitive results when compared to CNNs and ViTs. Despite its good performance in computer vision tasks, the MLP-Mixer architecture may not be suitable for refined feature extraction in images. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was proposed as a promising alternative to MLP models. KANs promise to improve accuracy and interpretability when compared to MLPs. Therefore, the present work aims to design a new mixer-based architecture, called KAN-Mixers, using KANs as main layers and evaluate its performance, in terms of several performance metrics, in the image classification task. As main results obtained, the KAN-Mixers model was superior to the MLP, MLP-Mixer and KAN models in the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with 0.9030 and 0.6980 of average accuracy, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joao D. S. Marques, Arlindo L. Oliveira</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) is an essential tool for diagnosing multiple cardiac anomalies: it provides valuable clinical insights, while being affordable, fast and available in many settings. However, in the current literature, the role of ECG analysis is often unclear: many approaches either rely on additional imaging modalities, such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA), which may not always be available, or do not effectively generalize across different classification problems. Furthermore, the availability of public ECG datasets is limited and, in practice, these datasets tend to be small, making it essential to optimize learning strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of multiple neural network architectures in order to assess the impact of various approaches. Moreover, we check whether these practices enhance model generalization when transfer learning is used to translate information learned in larger ECG datasets, such as PTB-XL and CPSC18, to a smaller, more challenging dataset for pulmonary embolism (PE) detection. By leveraging transfer learning, we analyze the extent to which we can improve learning efficiency and predictive performance on limited data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Li, Yi Ren, Xuesong Niu, Yi Ding, Xiu-Shen Wei, Cuntai Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial Action Units (AUs) are essential for conveying psychological states and emotional expressions. While automatic AU detection systems leveraging deep learning have progressed, they often overfit to specific datasets and individual features, limiting their cross-domain applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a doubly adaptive dropout approach for cross-domain AU detection, which enhances the robustness of convolutional feature maps and spatial tokens against domain shifts. This approach includes a Channel Drop Unit (CD-Unit) and a Token Drop Unit (TD-Unit), which work together to reduce domain-specific noise at both the channel and token levels. The CD-Unit preserves domain-agnostic local patterns in feature maps, while the TD-Unit helps the model identify AU relationships generalizable across domains. An auxiliary domain classifier, integrated at each layer, guides the selective omission of domain-sensitive features. To prevent excessive feature dropout, a progressive training strategy is used, allowing for selective exclusion of sensitive features at any model layer. Our method consistently outperforms existing techniques in cross-domain AU detection, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations. Visualizations of attention maps also highlight clear and meaningful patterns related to both individual and combined AUs, further validating the approach's effectiveness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08977">Decoupled Doubly Contrastive Learning for Cross Domain Facial Action Unit Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Li, Menglin Liu, Zhen Cui, Yi Ding, Yuan Zong, Wenming Zheng, Shiguang Shan, Cuntai Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of current vision-based facial action unit (AU) detection approaches, they are heavily susceptible to the variations across different domains and the cross-domain AU detection methods are under-explored. In response to this challenge, we propose a decoupled doubly contrastive adaptation (D$^2$CA) approach to learn a purified AU representation that is semantically aligned for the source and target domains. Specifically, we decompose latent representations into AU-relevant and AU-irrelevant components, with the objective of exclusively facilitating adaptation within the AU-relevant subspace. To achieve the feature decoupling, D$^2$CA is trained to disentangle AU and domain factors by assessing the quality of synthesized faces in cross-domain scenarios when either AU or domain attributes are modified. To further strengthen feature decoupling, particularly in scenarios with limited AU data diversity, D$^2$CA employs a doubly contrastive learning mechanism comprising image and feature-level contrastive learning to ensure the quality of synthesized faces and mitigate feature ambiguities. This new framework leads to an automatically learned, dedicated separation of AU-relevant and domain-relevant factors, and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the cross-domain facial image synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of D$^2$CA in successfully decoupling AU and domain factors, yielding visually pleasing cross-domain synthesized facial images. Meanwhile, D$^2$CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain AU detection approaches, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 6\%-14\% across various cross-domain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuzhong Hu, Zaipeng Duan, Pei An, Jun zhang, Jie Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Fusing LiDAR point cloud features and image features in a homogeneous BEV space has been widely adopted for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, such methods are limited by the excessive compression of multi-modal features. While some works explore feature fusion in dense voxel spaces, they suffer from high computational costs and inefficiencies in query generation. To address these limitations, we propose a Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion network (DDHFusion), which leverages the complementary advantages of both BEV and voxel domains while mitigating their respective drawbacks. Specifically, we first transform image features into BEV and sparse voxel spaces using LSS and our proposed semantic-aware feature sampling module which can significantly reduces computational overhead by filtering unimportant voxels. For feature encoding, we design two networks for BEV and voxel feature fusion, incorporating novel cross-modal voxel and BEV Mamba blocks to resolve feature misalignment and enable efficient yet comprehensive scene perception. The output voxel features are injected into the BEV space to compensate for the loss of 3D details caused by height compression. For feature decoding, a progressive query generation module is implemented in the BEV domain to alleviate false negatives during query selection caused by feature compression and small object sizes. Finally, a progressive decoder can sequentially aggregate not only context-rich BEV features but also geometry-aware voxel features, ensuring more precise confidence prediction and bounding box regression. On the NuScenes dataset, DDHfusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, and further experiments demonstrate its superiority over other homogeneous fusion methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongxin Liao, Feng Li, Yanyan Wei, Zenglin Shi, Le Zhang, Huihui Bai, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Universal adverse weather removal (UAWR) seeks to address various weather degradations within a unified framework. Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongshang Pang, Mayu Otani, Yuta Nakashima</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing user-queried events through natural language is crucial for video understanding models. Recent methods predominantly adapt Video LLMs to generate event boundary timestamps to handle temporal localization tasks, which struggle to leverage LLMs' powerful semantic understanding. In this work, we introduce MeCo, a novel timestamp-free framework that enables video LLMs to fully harness their intrinsic semantic capabilities for temporal localization tasks. Rather than outputting boundary timestamps, MeCo partitions videos into holistic event and transition segments based on the proposed structural token generation and grounding pipeline, derived from video LLMs' temporal structure understanding capability. We further propose a query-focused captioning task that compels the LLM to extract fine-grained, event-specific details, bridging the gap between localization and higher-level semantics and enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal localization tasks show that MeCo consistently outperforms boundary-centric methods, underscoring the benefits of a semantic-driven approach for temporal localization with video LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Haonan Chang, Yuhan Liu, Abdeslam Boularias</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel framework that uses motion graph as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions determining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. Additionally, we demonstrate the application potential of our method in generating novel object motions and robot demonstrations through motion editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Yifei Liu, Yingdong Shi, Changming Li, Anqi Pang, Sibei Yang, Jingyi Yu, Kan Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformer models exhibit immense power yet remain opaque to human understanding, posing challenges and risks for practical applications. While prior research has attempted to demystify these models through input attribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering layer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across layers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron paths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model input to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first propose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of neurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron locating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each layer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within the target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method finding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows, over the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have illustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working mechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category. We further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification task, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world applications like model pruning.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09081">Everything Can Be Described in Words: A Simple Unified Multi-Modal Framework with Semantic and Temporal Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowei Bi, Zheyuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long Video Question Answering (LVQA) is challenging due to the need for temporal reasoning and large-scale multimodal data processing. Existing methods struggle with retrieving cross-modal information from long videos, especially when relevant details are sparsely distributed. We introduce UMaT (Unified Multi-modal as Text), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that efficiently processes extremely long videos while maintaining cross-modal coherence. UMaT converts visual and auditory data into a unified textual representation, ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. Short video clips are analyzed using a vision-language model, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes dialogue. These text-based representations are structured into temporally aligned segments, with adaptive filtering to remove redundancy and retain salient details. The processed data is embedded into a vector database, enabling precise retrieval of dispersed yet relevant content. Experiments on a benchmark LVQA dataset show that UMaT outperforms existing methods in multimodal integration, long-form video understanding, and sparse information retrieval. Its scalability and interpretability allow it to process videos over an hour long while maintaining semantic and temporal coherence. These findings underscore the importance of structured retrieval and multimodal synchronization for advancing LVQA and long-form AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei-Sze Tan, Sailaja Rajanala, Arghya Pal, Rapha\"el C. -W. Phan, Huey-Fang Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting concealed emotions within apparently normal expressions is crucial for identifying potential mental health issues and facilitating timely support and intervention. The task of spotting macro and micro-expressions involves predicting the emotional timeline within a video, accomplished by identifying the onset, apex, and offset frames of the displayed emotions. Utilizing foundational facial muscle movement cues, known as facial action units, boosts the accuracy. However, an overlooked challenge from previous research lies in the inadvertent integration of biases into the training model. These biases arising from datasets can spuriously link certain action unit movements to particular emotion classes. We tackle this issue by novel replacement of action unit adjacency information with the action unit causal graphs. This approach aims to identify and eliminate undesired spurious connections, retaining only unbiased information for classification. Our model, named Causal-Ex (Causal-based Expression spotting), employs a rapid causal inference algorithm to construct a causal graph of facial action units. This enables us to select causally relevant facial action units. Our work demonstrates improvement in overall F1-scores compared to state-of-the-art approaches with 0.388 on CAS(ME)^2 and 0.3701 on SAMM-Long Video datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09106">Freeze and Cluster: A Simple Baseline for Rehearsal-Free Continual Category Discovery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyu Zhang, Xueyang Yu, Peiyan Gu, Xuming He</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Rehearsal-Free Continual Category Discovery (RF-CCD), which focuses on continuously identifying novel class by leveraging knowledge from labeled data. Existing methods typically train from scratch, overlooking the potential of base models, and often resort to data storage to prevent forgetting. Moreover, because RF-CCD encompasses both continual learning and novel class discovery, previous approaches have struggled to effectively integrate advanced techniques from these fields, resulting in less convincing comparisons and failing to reveal the unique challenges posed by RF-CCD. To address these challenges, we lead the way in integrating advancements from both domains and conducting extensive experiments and analyses. Our findings demonstrate that this integration can achieve state-of-the-art results, leading to the conclusion that in the presence of pre-trained models, the representation does not improve and may even degrade with the introduction of unlabeled data. To mitigate representation degradation, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective baseline method. This method first utilizes prior knowledge of known categories to estimate the number of novel classes. It then acquires representations using a model specifically trained on the base classes, generates high-quality pseudo-labels through k-means clustering, and trains only the classifier layer. We validate our conclusions and methods by conducting extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including the Stanford Cars, CUB, iNat, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. The results clearly illustrate our findings, demonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline, and pave the way for future advancements in RF-CCD.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-quality open-source text-to-image models have lowered the threshold for obtaining photorealistic images significantly, but also face potential risks of misuse. Specifically, suspects may use synthetic data generated by these generative models to train models for specific tasks without permission, when lacking real data resources especially. Protecting these generative models is crucial for the well-being of their owners. In this work, we propose the first method to this important yet unresolved issue, called Training data Provenance Verification (TrainProVe). The rationale behind TrainProVe is grounded in the principle of generalization error bound, which suggests that, for two models with the same task, if the distance between their training data distributions is smaller, their generalization ability will be closer. We validate the efficacy of TrainProVe across four text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion v1.4, latent consistency model, PixArt-$\alpha$, and Stable Cascade). The results show that TrainProVe achieves a verification accuracy of over 99\% in determining the provenance of suspicious model training data, surpassing all previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehui Wu, Yong Chen, Naoto Yokoya, Wei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

<p>Abstract: Automatic Video Object Segmentation (AVOS) refers to the task of autonomously segmenting target objects in video sequences without relying on human-provided annotations in the first frames. In AVOS, the use of motion information is crucial, with optical flow being a commonly employed method for capturing motion cues. However, the computation of optical flow is resource-intensive, making it unsuitable for real-time applications, especially on edge devices with limited computational resources. In this study, we propose using frame differences as an alternative to optical flow for motion cue extraction. We developed an extended U-Net-like AVOS model that takes a frame on which segmentation is performed and a frame difference as inputs, and outputs an estimated segmentation map. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves performance comparable to the model with optical flow as an input, particularly when applied to videos captured by stationary cameras. Our results suggest the usefulness of employing frame differences as motion cues in cases with limited computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI personal assistants, deployed through robots or wearables, require embodied understanding to collaborate effectively with humans. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique aspects of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D. Our approach features a progressive training pipeline with three stages: Teacher Self-Preparation, Teacher-Student Guidance, and Student Self-Practice. Additionally, we propose an instruction-tuning data EgoIT from multiple sources to strengthen the model's instruction-following capabilities, along with the EgoBench benchmark comprising eight different tasks for thorough evaluation. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), effectively understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge. Perceiving lengthy videos containing thousands of frames poses substantial computational burden. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces Generative Frame Sampler (GenS), a plug-and-play module integrated with VideoLLMs to facilitate efficient lengthy video perception. Built upon a lightweight VideoLLM, GenS leverages its inherent vision-language capabilities to identify question-relevant frames. To facilitate effective retrieval, we construct GenS-Video-150K, a large-scale video instruction dataset with dense frame relevance annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenS consistently boosts the performance of various VideoLLMs, including open-source models (Qwen2-VL-7B, Aria-25B, VILA-40B, LLaVA-Video-7B/72B) and proprietary assistants (GPT-4o, Gemini). When equipped with GenS, open-source VideoLLMs achieve impressive state-of-the-art results on long-form video benchmarks: LLaVA-Video-72B reaches 66.8 (+4.3) on LongVideoBench and 77.0 (+2.7) on MLVU, while Aria obtains 39.2 on HourVideo surpassing the Gemini-1.5-pro by 1.9 points.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) shows strong potential in addressing long-video understanding (LVU) tasks. However, traditional RAG methods remain fundamentally limited due to their dependence on explicit search queries, which are unavailable in many situations. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel RAG-based LVU approach inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings, which is called MemVid. Our approach operates with four basics steps: memorizing holistic video information, reasoning about the task's information needs based on the memory, retrieving critical moments based on the information needs, and focusing on the retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's memory-grounded reasoning capabilities and achieve optimal end-to-end performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiment, MemVid significantly outperforms existing RAG-based methods and popular LVU models, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our model and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengshu Zhao, Yunyang Ge, Xinhua Cheng, Bin Zhu, Yatian Pang, Bin Lin, Fan Yang, Feng Gao, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video body-swapping aims to replace the body in an existing video with a new body from arbitrary sources, which has garnered more attention in recent years. Existing methods treat video body-swapping as a composite of multiple tasks instead of an independent task and typically rely on various models to achieve video body-swapping sequentially. However, these methods fail to achieve end-to-end optimization for the video body-swapping which causes issues such as variations in luminance among frames, disorganized occlusion relationships, and the noticeable separation between bodies and background. In this work, we define video body-swapping as an independent task and propose three critical consistencies: identity consistency, motion consistency, and environment consistency. We introduce an end-to-end model named SwapAnyone, treating video body-swapping as a video inpainting task with reference fidelity and motion control. To improve the ability to maintain environmental harmony, particularly luminance harmony in the resulting video, we introduce a novel EnvHarmony strategy for training our model progressively. Additionally, we provide a dataset named HumanAction-32K covering various videos about human actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance among open-source methods while approaching or surpassing closed-source models across multiple dimensions. All code, model weights, and the HumanAction-32K dataset will be open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/SwapAnyone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fufangchen Zhao, Ming Li, Linrui Xu, Wenhao Jiang, Jian Gao, Danfeng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-based multimodal large language models (VMLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in cross-modal video understanding. However, their abilities in fine-grained face comprehension remain largely underexplored. Given its pivotal role in human-centric intelligence, developing VMLLMs for facial understanding holds a fundamental problem. To address this gap, we propose FaVChat, the first VMLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial video understanding. To facilitate its training, we construct a large-scale facial video dataset comprising over 60k videos, with the majority annotated with 83 fine-grained facial attributes. These attributes are incorporated to enrich GPT-4o-generated captions, yielding 60k high-quality video-summary pairs and an additional 170k fine-grained question-answering (QA) pairs. To effectively capture rich facial clues, we propose a hybrid model architecture composed of a general visual encoder, a dedicated facial encoder, and a mixture-of-experts-enhanced adapter for adaptive fusion of multi-source visual features. To mitigate information loss during feature transformation, we extract multi-granularity representations from the facial encoder and integrate them into the subsequent LLM. This design enhances the model's ability to comprehend and respond to questions involving diverse levels of visual details. We employ a progressive training paradigm, transitioning from video summarization to a high-quality subset of video QA, gradually increasing task complexity to enhance the model's fine-grained visual perception. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluation on a couple of public benchmarks, demonstrating that FaVChat consistently surpasses existing VMLLMs across multiple tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Feng, Zhi Zuo, Jia-hui Pan, Ka-hei Hui, Yi-hua Shao, Qi Dou, Wei Xie, Zheng-zhe Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce \textit{WonderVerse}, a simple but effective framework for generating extendable 3D scenes. Unlike existing methods that rely on iterative depth estimation and image inpainting, often leading to geometric distortions and inconsistencies, WonderVerse leverages the powerful world-level priors embedded within video generative foundation models to create highly immersive and geometrically coherent 3D environments. Furthermore, we propose a new technique for controllable 3D scene extension to substantially increase the scale of the generated environments. Besides, we introduce a novel abnormal sequence detection module that utilizes camera trajectory to address geometric inconsistency in the generated videos. Finally, WonderVerse is compatible with various 3D reconstruction methods, allowing both efficient and high-quality generation. Extensive experiments on 3D scene generation demonstrate that our WonderVerse, with an elegant and simple pipeline, delivers extendable and highly-realistic 3D scenes, markedly outperforming existing works that rely on more complex architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanyang Zhang, Yijie Lin, Weiqing Yan, Li Yao, Xinhang Wan, Guangyuan Li, Chao Zhang, Guanzhou Ke, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the common issue of missing data in multi-view datasets. The primary approach to address this challenge involves recovering the missing views before applying conventional multi-view clustering methods. Although imputation-based IMVC methods have achieved significant improvements, they still encounter notable limitations: 1) heavy reliance on paired data for training the data recovery module, which is impractical in real scenarios with high missing data rates; 2) the generated data often lacks diversity and discriminability, resulting in suboptimal clustering results. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel IMVC method called Diffusion Contrastive Generation (DCG). Motivated by the consistency between the diffusion and clustering processes, DCG learns the distribution characteristics to enhance clustering by applying forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes to intra-view data. By performing contrastive learning on a limited set of paired multi-view samples, DCG can align the generated views with the real views, facilitating accurate recovery of views across arbitrary missing view scenarios. Additionally, DCG integrates instance-level and category-level interactive learning to exploit the consistent and complementary information available in multi-view data, achieving robust and end-to-end clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qipeng Mei, Dimitri Bulatov, Dorota Iwaszczuk</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for roof detail extraction and vectorization using remote sensing images. Unlike previous geometric-primitive-based methods that rely on the detection of corners, our method focuses on edge detection as the primary mechanism for roof reconstruction, while utilizing geometric relationships to define corners and faces. We adapt the YOLOv8 OBB model, originally designed for rotated object detection, to extract roof edges effectively. Our method demonstrates robustness against noise and occlusion, leading to precise vectorized representations of building roofs. Experiments conducted on the SGA and Melville datasets highlight the method's effectiveness. At the raster level, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art foundation segmentation model (SAM), achieving a mIoU between 0.85 and 1 for most samples and an ovIoU close to 0.97. At the vector level, evaluation using the Hausdorff distance, PolyS metric, and our raster-vector-metric demonstrates significant improvements after polygonization, with a close approximation to the reference data. The method successfully handles diverse roof structures and refines edge gaps, even on complex roof structures of new, excluded from training datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of this approach to address challenges in automatic roof structure vectorization, supporting various applications such as urban terrain reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juana Valeria Hurtado, Sajad Marvi, Rohit Mohan, Abhinav Valada</p>
<p>Abstract: Panoptic tracking enables pixel-level scene interpretation of videos by integrating instance tracking in panoptic segmentation. This provides robots with a spatio-temporal understanding of the environment, an essential attribute for their operation in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for panoptic tracking that simultaneously captures general semantic information and instance-specific appearance and motion features. Unlike existing methods that overlook dynamic scene attributes, our approach leverages both appearance and motion cues through dedicated network heads. These interconnected heads employ multi-scale deformable convolutions that reason about scene motion offsets with semantic context and motion-enhanced appearance features to learn tracking embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a novel two-step fusion module that integrates the outputs from both heads by first matching instances from the current time step with propagated instances from previous time steps and subsequently refines associations using motion-enhanced appearance embeddings, improving robustness in challenging scenarios. Extensive evaluations of our proposed \netname model on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoptic tracking accuracy, surpassing prior methods in maintaining object identities over time.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Zhang, Haoning Wu, Ziheng Jia, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality scoring and interpreting are two fundamental components of Image Quality Assessment (IQA). The former quantifies image quality, while the latter enables descriptive question answering about image quality. Traditionally, these two tasks have been addressed independently. However, from the perspective of the Human Visual System (HVS) and the Perception-Decision Integration Model, they are inherently interconnected: interpreting serves as the foundation for scoring, while scoring provides an abstract summary of interpreting. Thus, unifying these capabilities within a single model is both intuitive and logically coherent. In this paper, we propose Q-SiT (Quality Scoring and Interpreting joint Teaching), a unified framework that enables large multimodal models (LMMs) to learn both image quality scoring and interpreting simultaneously. We achieve this by transforming conventional IQA datasets into learnable question-answering datasets and incorporating human-annotated quality interpreting data for training. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient scoring & interpreting balance strategy, which first determines the optimal data mix ratio on lightweight LMMs and then maps this ratio to primary LMMs for fine-tuning adjustment. This strategy not only mitigates task interference and enhances cross-task knowledge transfer but also significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct optimization on full-scale LMMs. With this joint learning framework and corresponding training strategy, we develop Q-SiT, the first model capable of simultaneously performing image quality scoring and interpreting tasks, along with its lightweight variant, Q-SiT-mini. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-SiT achieves strong performance in both tasks with superior generalization IQA abilities.Project page at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-SiT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Zhu, Zhengyu Jia, Tian Gao, Jiaxin Deng, Shidi Li, Fu Liu, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Xiaolong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Kniesel, Pedro Hermosilla, Timo Ropinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in conditional image generation from diffusion models have shown great potential in achieving impressive image quality while preserving the constraints introduced by the user. In particular, ControlNet enables precise alignment between ground truth segmentation masks and the generated image content, allowing the enhancement of training datasets in segmentation tasks. This raises a key question: Can ControlNet additionally be guided to generate the most informative synthetic samples for a specific task? Inspired by active learning, where the most informative real-world samples are selected based on sample difficulty or model uncertainty, we propose the first approach to integrate active learning-based selection metrics into the backward diffusion process for sample generation. Specifically, we explore uncertainty, query by committee, and expected model change, which are commonly used in active learning, and demonstrate their application for guiding the sample generation process through gradient approximation. Our method is training-free, modifying only the backward diffusion process, allowing it to be used on any pretrained ControlNet. Using this process, we show that segmentation models trained with guided synthetic data outperform those trained on non-guided synthetic data. Our work underscores the need for advanced control mechanisms for diffusion-based models, which are not only aligned with image content but additionally downstream task performance, highlighting the true potential of synthetic data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Ma, Bo Cheng, Shanyuan Liu, Ao Ma, Xiaoyu Wu, Liebucha Wu, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow-based transformer models for image generation have achieved state-of-the-art performance with larger model parameters, but their inference deployment cost remains high. To enhance inference performance while maintaining generation quality, we propose progressive rectified flow transformers. We divide the rectified flow into different stages according to resolution, using fewer transformer layers at the low-resolution stages to generate image layouts and concept contours, and progressively adding more layers as the resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves fast convergence and reduces inference time while ensuring generation quality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce progressive rectified flow transformers that enable multi-resolution training, accelerating model convergence; (2) NAMI leverages piecewise flow and spatial cascading of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to rapidly generate images, reducing inference time by 40% to generate a 1024 resolution image; (3) We propose NAMI-1K benchmark to evaluate human preference performance, aiming to mitigate distributional bias and prevent data leakage from open-source benchmarks. The results show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cell tracking is a key computational task in live-cell microscopy, but fully automated analysis of high-throughput imaging requires reliable and, thus, uncertainty-aware data analysis tools, as the amount of data recorded within a single experiment exceeds what humans are able to overlook. We here propose and benchmark various methods to reason about and quantify uncertainty in linear assignment-based cell tracking algorithms. Our methods take inspiration from statistics and machine learning, leveraging two perspectives on the cell tracking problem explored throughout this work: Considering it as a Bayesian inference problem and as a classification problem. Our methods admit a framework-like character in that they equip any frame-to-frame tracking method with uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate this by applying it to various existing tracking algorithms including the recently presented Transformer-based trackers. We demonstrate empirically that our methods yield useful and well-calibrated tracking uncertainties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihua Zhou, Mao Ye, Shuaifeng Li, Nianxin Li, Xiatian Zhu, Lei Deng, Hongbin Liu, Zhen Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, aims to adapt the model to new, potentially out-of-distribution test data. Existing methods calculate the similarity between visual embedding and learnable class embeddings, which are initialized by text embeddings, for zero-shot image classification. In this work, we first analyze this process based on Bayes theorem, and observe that the core factors influencing the final prediction are the likelihood and the prior. However, existing methods essentially focus on adapting class embeddings to adapt likelihood, but they often ignore the importance of prior. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach, \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{C}lass \textbf{A}daptation (BCA), which in addition to continuously updating class embeddings to adapt likelihood, also uses the posterior of incoming samples to continuously update the prior for each class embedding. This dual updating mechanism allows the model to better adapt to distribution shifts and achieve higher prediction accuracy. Our method not only surpasses existing approaches in terms of performance metrics but also maintains superior inference rates and memory usage, making it highly efficient and practical for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary object detectors can recognize a wide range of categories using simple textual prompts. However, improving their ability to detect rare classes or specialize in certain domains remains a challenge. While most recent methods rely on a single set of model weights for adaptation, we take a different approach by using modular deep learning. We introduce DitHub, a framework designed to create and manage a library of efficient adaptation modules. Inspired by Version Control Systems, DitHub organizes expert modules like branches that can be fetched and merged as needed. This modular approach enables a detailed study of how adaptation modules combine, making it the first method to explore this aspect in Object Detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ODinW-13 benchmark and ODinW-O, a newly introduced benchmark designed to evaluate how well models adapt when previously seen classes reappear.

<p>Abstract: Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) is a crucial task for vision-language bridging, enabling fine-grained descriptions of complex video content. In this paper, we first comprehensively benchmark current state-of-the-art approaches and systematically identified two critical limitations: biased capability towards specific captioning aspect and misalignment with human preferences. To address these deficiencies, we propose Cockatiel, a novel three-stage training pipeline that ensembles synthetic and human-aligned training for improving VDC performance. In the first stage, we derive a scorer from a meticulously annotated dataset to select synthetic captions high-performing on certain fine-grained video-caption alignment and human-preferred while disregarding others. Then, we train Cockatiel-13B, using this curated dataset to infuse it with assembled model strengths and human preferences. Finally, we further distill Cockatiel-8B from Cockatiel-13B for the ease of usage. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments reflect the effectiveness of our method, as we not only set new state-of-the-art performance on VDCSCORE in a dimension-balanced way but also surpass leading alternatives on human preference by a large margin as depicted by the human evaluation results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on recent advances in Bayesian statistics and image denoising, we propose Noise2Score3D, a fully unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising. Noise2Score3D learns the score function of the underlying point cloud distribution directly from noisy data, eliminating the need for clean data during training. Using Tweedie's formula, our method performs denoising in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thus improving both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Clouds as a denoising quality metric, which allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks among unsupervised learning methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics. Noise2Score3D also demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Our method, by addressing the generalization issue and challenge of the absence of clean data in learning-based methods, paves the way for learning-based point cloud denoising methods in real-world applications.</p>

To achieve this, we introduce a novel animatable avatar with 3D Gaussians rigged on a personalized mesh and propose to optimize the motion sequence with time-dependent MLPs that provide accurate and temporally consistent pose estimates. We first evaluate our method on highly challenging yoga poses and demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on multi-view human pose estimation, reducing error by 35% on body joints and 45% on hand joints compared to keypoint-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Hu, Chunming He, Lei Xu, Jingduo Tian, Sina Farsiu, Yulun Zhang, Pei Liu, Xiu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) addresses the challenge of reconstructing degraded low-quality (LQ) facial images into high-quality (HQ) outputs. Conventional approaches predominantly rely on learning feature representations from ground-truth (GT) data; however, inherent imperfections in GT datasets constrain restoration performance to the mean quality level of the training data, rather than attaining maximally attainable visual quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates an Image Quality Prior (IQP) derived from No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models to guide the restoration process toward optimal HQ reconstructions. Our methodology synergizes this IQP with a learned codebook prior through two critical innovations: (1) During codebook learning, we devise a dual-branch codebook architecture that disentangles feature extraction into universal structural components and HQ-specific attributes, ensuring comprehensive representation of both common and high-quality facial characteristics. (2) In the codebook lookup stage, we implement a quality-conditioned Transformer-based framework. NR-IQA-derived quality scores act as dynamic conditioning signals to steer restoration toward the highest feasible quality standard. This score-conditioned paradigm enables plug-and-play enhancement of existing BFR architectures without modifying the original structure. We also formulate a discrete representation-based quality optimization strategy that circumvents over-optimization artifacts prevalent in continuous latent space approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple benchmarks. Besides, our quality-conditioned framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements when integrated with prior BFR models. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathleen Anderson, Thomas Martinetz</p>
<p>Abstract: We evaluate the information that can unintentionally leak into the low dimensional output of a neural network, by reconstructing an input image from a 40- or 32-element feature vector that intends to only describe abstract attributes of a facial portrait. The reconstruction uses blackbox-access to the image encoder which generates the feature vector. Other than previous work, we leverage recent knowledge about image generation and facial similarity, implementing a method that outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Our strategy uses a pretrained StyleGAN and a new loss function that compares the perceptual similarity of portraits by mapping them into the latent space of a FaceNet embedding. Additionally, we present a new technique that fuses the output of an ensemble, to deliberately generate specific aspects of the recreated image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghan Li, Jingjing Chen, Yue Yu, Xue Song, Haijun Shan, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision generation models, the potential security risks stemming from synthetic visual content have garnered increasing attention, posing significant challenges for AI-generated image detection. Existing methods suffer from inadequate generalization capabilities, resulting in unsatisfactory performance on emerging generative models. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel framework that leverages noise-based model-specific imprint for the detection task. Specifically, we propose a novel noise-based imprint simulator to capture intrinsic patterns imprinted in images generated by different models. By aggregating imprints from various generative models, imprints of future models can be extrapolated to expand training data, thereby enhancing generalization and robustness. Furthermore, we design a new pipeline that pioneers the use of noise patterns, derived from a noise-based imprint extractor, alongside other visual features for AI-generated image detection, resulting in a significant improvement in performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across three public benchmarks including GenImage, Synthbuster and Chameleon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marvin Heidinger, Snehal Jauhri, Vignesh Prasad, Georgia Chalvatzaki</p>
<p>Abstract: When interacting with objects, humans effectively reason about which regions of objects are viable for an intended action, i.e., the affordance regions of the object. They can also account for subtle differences in object regions based on the task to be performed and whether one or two hands need to be used. However, current vision-based affordance prediction methods often reduce the problem to naive object part segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting affordance data from human activity video datasets. Our extracted 2HANDS dataset contains precise object affordance region segmentations and affordance class-labels as narrations of the activity performed. The data also accounts for bimanual actions, i.e., two hands co-ordinating and interacting with one or more objects. We present a VLM-based affordance prediction model, 2HandedAfforder, trained on the dataset and demonstrate superior performance over baselines in affordance region segmentation for various activities. Finally, we show that our predicted affordance regions are actionable, i.e., can be used by an agent performing a task, through demonstration in robotic manipulation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gorjan Radevski, Teodora Popordanoska, Matthew B. Blaschko, Tinne Tuytelaars</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual understanding is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to integrate and interpret information from both auditory and visual modalities. Despite recent advances in multi-modal learning, existing benchmarks often suffer from strong visual bias -- where answers can be inferred from visual data alone -- and provide only aggregate scores that conflate multiple sources of error. This makes it difficult to determine whether models struggle with visual understanding, audio interpretation, or audio-visual alignment. In this work, we introduce DAVE (Diagnostic Audio Visual Evaluation), a novel benchmark dataset designed to systematically evaluate audio-visual models across controlled challenges. DAVE alleviates existing limitations by (i) ensuring both modalities are necessary to answer correctly and (ii) decoupling evaluation into atomic subcategories. Our detailed analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals specific failure modes and provides targeted insights for improvement. By offering this standardized diagnostic framework, we aim to facilitate more robust development of audio-visual models. The dataset is released: https://github.com/gorjanradevski/dave</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Sun, Huhao Guan, Kun Zhang, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic and static components in scenes often exhibit distinct properties, yet most 4D reconstruction methods treat them indiscriminately, leading to suboptimal performance in both cases. This work introduces SDD-4DGS, the first framework for static-dynamic decoupled 4D scene reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting. Our approach is built upon a novel probabilistic dynamic perception coefficient that is naturally integrated into the Gaussian reconstruction pipeline, enabling adaptive separation of static and dynamic components. With carefully designed implementation strategies to realize this theoretical framework, our method effectively facilitates explicit learning of motion patterns for dynamic elements while maintaining geometric stability for static structures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDD-4DGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction fidelity, with enhanced detail restoration for static structures and precise modeling of dynamic motions. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Feng, Dingxin Zhang, Runkai Zhao, Yong Xia, Heng Huang, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks (DNN) by implanting hidden backdoors that can be activated with predefined triggers to manipulate model behaviors maliciously. Existing 3D point cloud backdoor attacks primarily rely on sample-wise global modifications, resulting in suboptimal stealthiness. To address this limitation, we propose Stealthy Patch-Wise Backdoor Attack (SPBA), which employs the first patch-wise trigger for 3D point clouds and restricts perturbations to local regions, significantly enhancing stealthiness. Specifically, SPBA decomposes point clouds into local patches and evaluates their geometric complexity using a curvature-based patch imperceptibility score, ensuring that the trigger remains less perceptible to the human eye by strategically applying it across multiple geometrically complex patches with lower visual sensitivity. By leveraging the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT), SPBA optimizes a patch-wise spectral trigger that perturbs the spectral features of selected patches, enhancing attack effectiveness while preserving the global geometric structure of the point cloud. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that SPBA consistently achieves an attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 96.5% across different models while achieving state-of-the-art imperceptibility compared to existing backdoor attack methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aymen Mir, Arthur Moreau, Helisa Dhamo, Zhensong Zhang, Eduardo P\'erez-Pellitero</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GASPACHO: a method for generating photorealistic controllable renderings of human-object interactions. Given a set of multi-view RGB images of human-object interactions, our method reconstructs animatable templates of the human and object as separate sets of Gaussians simultaneously. Different from existing work, which focuses on human reconstruction and ignores objects as background, our method explicitly reconstructs both humans and objects, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. During reconstruction, we constrain the Gaussians that generate rendered images to be a linear function of a set of canonical Gaussians. By simply changing the parameters of the linear deformation functions after training, our method can generate renderings of novel human-object interaction in novel poses from novel camera viewpoints. We learn the 3D Gaussian properties of the canonical Gaussians on the underlying 2D manifold of the canonical human and object templates. This in turns requires a canonical object template with a fixed UV unwrapping. To define such an object template, we use a feature based representation to track the object across the multi-view sequence. We further propose an occlusion aware photometric loss that allows for reconstructions under significant occlusions. Several experiments on two human-object datasets - BEHAVE and DNA-Rendering - demonstrate that our method allows for high-quality reconstruction of human and object templates under significant occlusion and the synthesis of controllable renderings of novel human-object interactions in novel human poses from novel camera views.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Quality Inspection plays a crucial role in modern manufacturing environments as it ensures customer safety and satisfaction. The introduction of Computer Vision (CV) has revolutionized visual quality inspection by improving the accuracy and efficiency of defect detection. However, traditional CV models heavily rely on extensive datasets for training, which can be costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. To overcome these challenges, synthetic images have emerged as a promising alternative. They offer a cost-effective solution with automatically generated labels. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for generating synthetic images using domain randomization. We evaluate our approach in three real inspection scenarios and demonstrate that an object detection model trained solely on synthetic data can outperform models trained on real images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianyuan Yu, Xiuzhen Guo, Ji Shi, Hongxiao Wang, Hongwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning enhances medical image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data, reducing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. On the one hand, the distribution discrepancy between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data can hinder model generalization. Most existing methods rely on local similarity matching, which may introduce bias. In contrast, Mamba effectively models global context with linear complexity, learning more comprehensive data representations. On the other hand, medical images usually exhibit consistent anatomical structures defined by geometric features. Most existing methods fail to fully utilize global geometric priors, such as volumes, moments etc. In this work, we introduce a global information interaction and geometric priors focus framework (GIGP). Firstly, we present a Global Information Interaction Mamba module to reduce distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data. Secondly, we propose a Geometric Moment Attention Mechanism to extract richer global geometric features. Finally, we propose Global Geometric Perturbation Consistency to simulate organ dynamics and geometric variations, enhancing the ability of the model to learn generalized features. The superior performance on the NIH Pancreas and Left Atrium datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, sparking widespread discourse across social media platforms. Activists, policymakers, and researchers seek to understand public sentiment and narratives while access to social media data has become increasingly restricted in the post-API era. In this study, we analyze a dataset of climate change-related tweets from X (formerly Twitter) shared in 2019, containing 730k tweets along with the shared images. Our approach integrates statistical analysis, image classification, object detection, and sentiment analysis to explore visual narratives in climate discourse. Additionally, we introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interactive data exploration. Our findings reveal key themes in climate communication, highlight sentiment divergence between images and text, and underscore the strengths and limitations of foundation models in analyzing social media imagery. By releasing our code and tools, we aim to support future research on the intersection of climate change, social media, and computer vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Huang, Yang Li, Dushuai Li, Yao Mu, Hongmao Qin, Nan Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Nan, Huichi Zhou, Xiaodan Xing, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Lei Zhu, Zhifan Gao, Alejandro F Fangi, Guang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence and digital medicine increasingly permeate healthcare systems, robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure ethical, secure, and effective implementation. In this context, medical image retrieval becomes a critical component of clinical data management, playing a vital role in decision-making and safeguarding patient information. Existing methods usually learn hash functions using bottleneck features, which fail to produce representative hash codes from blended embeddings. Although contrastive hashing has shown superior performance, current approaches often treat image retrieval as a classification task, using category labels to create positive/negative pairs. Moreover, many methods fail to address the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue when models encounter external OOD queries or adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method to consolidate knowledge of hierarchical features and optimisation functions. We formulate the knowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF) and Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates shallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates image fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings. These blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based recommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment. Moreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and reproducibility of retrieval results. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively recognise OOD samples and significantly outperform existing approaches in medical image retrieval (p<0.05). In particular, our method achieves a 5.6-38.9% improvement in mean Average Precision on the anatomical radiology dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangzheng Qi, Zhenjie Hou, En Lin, Xing Li, iuzhen Liang, Xinwen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The recognition of pig behavior plays a crucial role in smart farming and welfare assurance for pigs. Currently, in the field of pig behavior recognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits the development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and algorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig behaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and their associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a spatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement network. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing connections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the video data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens the important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term dependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by remodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of spatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that on the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP score of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing traditional model. This study not only improces the accuracy and generalizability of individual pig behavior recognition but also provides new technological tools for modern smart farming. The dataset and related code will be made publicly available alongside this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruanjun Li, Yuedong Tan, Yuanming Shi, Jiawei Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces VideoScan, an efficient vision-language model (VLM) inference framework designed for real-time video interaction that effectively comprehends and retains streamed video inputs while delivering rapid and accurate responses. A longstanding challenge in video understanding--particularly for long-term or real-time applications--stems from the substantial computational overhead caused by the extensive length of visual tokens. To address this, VideoScan employs a single semantic carrier token to represent each frame, progressively reducing computational and memory overhead during its two-phase inference process: prefilling and decoding. The embedding of the semantic carrier token is derived from an optimized aggregation of frame-level visual features, ensuring compact yet semantically rich representations. Critically, the corresponding key-value pairs are trained to retain contextual semantics from prior frames, enabling efficient memory management without sacrificing temporal coherence. During inference, the visual tokens of each frame are processed only once during the prefilling phase and subsequently discarded in the decoding stage, eliminating redundant computations. This design ensures efficient VLM inference even under stringent real-time constraints. Comprehensive experiments on diverse offline and online benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Video, supported by our method, achieves up to $\sim 5\times$ and $1.29\times$ speedups compared to its original version and previous efficient streaming video understanding approaches, respectively. Crucially, these improvements are attained while maintaining competitive performance and ensuring stable GPU memory consumption (consistently $\sim 18$GB, independent of video duration).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhen Qiao, Peng Huang, Jiakang Yuan, Xianda Guo, Bowen Ye, Zhe Sun, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial in maintaining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) performance when facing real-world distribution shifts, particularly when the source data or target labels are inaccessible. Existing TTA methods rely on CLIP's output probability distribution for feature evaluation, which can introduce biases under domain shifts. This misalignment may cause features to be misclassified due to text priors or incorrect textual associations. To address these limitations, we propose Bidirectional Prototype-Reward co-Evolution (BPRE), a novel TTA framework for VLMs that integrates feature quality assessment with prototype evolution through a synergistic feedback loop. BPRE first employs a Multi-Dimensional Quality-Aware Reward Module to evaluate feature quality and guide prototype refinement precisely. The continuous refinement of prototype quality through Prototype-Reward Interactive Evolution will subsequently enhance the computation of more robust Multi-Dimensional Quality-Aware Reward Scores. Through the bidirectional interaction, the precision of rewards and the evolution of prototypes mutually reinforce each other, forming a self-evolving cycle. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 diverse recognition datasets encompassing natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization scenarios. Results demonstrate that BPRE consistently achieves superior average performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across different model architectures, such as ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16. By emphasizing comprehensive feature evaluation and bidirectional knowledge refinement, BPRE advances VLM generalization capabilities, offering a new perspective on TTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiatong Xia, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to carefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above schemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate better research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically selected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a clear advantage over competitive solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Brian Moser, Federico Raue, Stanislav Frolov, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance in large-scale image classification. However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation scheme that addresses these challenges and explicitly includes inductive biases, which commonly are part of the neural network architecture, into the training data. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds, enabling fine-grained control over image composition during training. It thus increases the data diversity and effective number of training samples. We demonstrate that training on ForNet, the application of ForAug to ImageNet, significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet and 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug enables novel ways of analyzing model behavior and quantifying biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that training on ForNet substantially reduces these biases compared to training on ImageNet. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09402">VLog: Video-Language Models by Generative Retrieval of Narration Vocabulary</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Qinghong Lin, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Human daily activities can be concisely narrated as sequences of routine events (e.g., turning off an alarm) in video streams, forming an event vocabulary. Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's efficient similarity search. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Jiang, Gehui Li, Bin Chen, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image restoration (IR) is challenging due to the complexity of real-world degradations. While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system. Code and models will be made available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09408">Diff-CL: A Novel Cross Pseudo-Supervision Method for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuzhen Guo, Lianyuan Yu, Ji Shi, Na Lei, Hongxiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning utilizes insights from unlabeled data to improve model generalization, thereby reducing reliance on large labeled datasets. Most existing studies focus on limited samples and fail to capture the overall data distribution. We contend that combining distributional information with detailed information is crucial for achieving more robust and accurate segmentation results. On the one hand, with its robust generative capabilities, diffusion models (DM) learn data distribution effectively. However, it struggles with fine detail capture, leading to generated images with misleading details. Combining DM with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enables the former to learn data distribution while the latter corrects fine details. While capturing complete high-frequency details by CNNs requires substantial computational resources and is susceptible to local noise. On the other hand, given that both labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution, we believe that regions in unlabeled data similar to overall class semantics to labeled data are likely to belong to the same class, while regions with minimal similarity are less likely to. This work introduces a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework from the distribution perspective (Diff-CL). Firstly, we propose a cross-pseudo-supervision learning mechanism between diffusion and convolution segmentation networks. Secondly, we design a high-frequency mamba module to capture boundary and detail information globally. Finally, we apply contrastive learning for label propagation from labeled to unlabeled data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across three datasets, including left atrium, brain tumor, and NIH pancreas datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Wang, Chen Zhao, Wei Ke, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is a fundamental approach for robustly estimating parametric models from noisy data. Existing learning-based RANSAC methods utilize deep learning to enhance the robustness of RANSAC against outliers. However, these approaches are trained and tested on the data generated by the same algorithms, leading to limited generalization to out-of-distribution data during inference. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based paradigm that progressively injects noise into ground-truth data, simulating the noisy conditions for training learning-based RANSAC. To enhance data diversity, we incorporate Monte Carlo sampling into the diffusion paradigm, approximating diverse data distributions by introducing different types of randomness at multiple stages. We evaluate our approach in the context of feature matching through comprehensive experiments on the ScanNet and MegaDepth datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our Monte Carlo diffusion mechanism significantly improves the generalization ability of learning-based RANSAC. We also develop extensive ablation studies that highlight the effectiveness of key components in our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Liu, Weiying Xue, Yuxiao Wang, Zhenao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The video visual relation detection (VidVRD) task is to identify objects and their relationships in videos, which is challenging due to the dynamic content, high annotation costs, and long-tailed distribution of relations. Visual language models (VLMs) help explore open-vocabulary visual relation detection tasks, yet often overlook the connections between various visual regions and their relations. Moreover, using VLMs to directly identify visual relations in videos poses significant challenges because of the large disparity between images and videos. Therefore, we propose a novel open-vocabulary VidVRD framework, termed OpenVidVRD, which transfers VLMs' rich knowledge and powerful capabilities to improve VidVRD tasks through prompt learning. Specificall y, We use VLM to extract text representations from automatically generated region captions based on the video's regions. Next, we develop a spatiotemporal refiner module to derive object-level relationship representations in the video by integrating cross-modal spatiotemporal complementary information. Furthermore, a prompt-driven strategy to align semantic spaces is employed to harness the semantic understanding of VLMs, enhancing the overall generalization ability of OpenVidVRD. Extensive experiments conducted on the VidVRD and VidOR public datasets show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09419">Alias-Free Latent Diffusion Models:Improving Fractional Shift Equivariance of Diffusion Latent Space</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhou, Zeqi Xiao, Shuai Yang, Xingang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are known to have an unstable generation process, where even small perturbations or shifts in the input noise can lead to significantly different outputs. This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qijian Zhang, Xiaozheng Jian, Xuan Zhang, Wenping Wang, Junhui Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional production workflow of high-precision 3D mesh assets necessitates a cumbersome and laborious process of manual sculpting by specialized modelers. The recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in AI-empowered 3D content creation. However, although the latest state-of-the-arts are already capable of generating plausible structures and intricate appearances from images or text prompts, the actual mesh surfaces are typically over-smoothing and lack geometric details. This paper introduces SuperCarver, a 3D geometry super-resolution framework particularly tailored for adding texture-consistent surface details to given coarse meshes. Technically, we start by rendering the original textured mesh into the image domain from multiple viewpoints. To achieve geometric detail generation, we develop a deterministic prior-guided normal diffusion model fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of paired low-poly and high-poly normal renderings. To optimize mesh structures from potentially imperfect normal map predictions, we design a simple yet effective noise-resistant inverse rendering scheme based on distance field deformation. Extensive experiments show that SuperCarver generates realistic and expressive surface details as depicted by specific texture appearances, making it a powerful tool for automatically upgrading massive outdated low-quality assets and shortening the iteration cycle of high-quality mesh production in practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a pivotal paradigm in multimodal understanding, offering a powerful framework for integrating visual and linguistic information. However, the increasing complexity and diversity of tasks present significant challenges in coordinating load balancing across heterogeneous visual experts, where optimizing one specialist's performance often compromises others' capabilities. To address task heterogeneity and expert load imbalance, we propose Astrea, a novel multi-expert collaborative VLM architecture based on progressive pre-alignment. Astrea introduces three key innovations: 1) A heterogeneous expert coordination mechanism that integrates four specialized models (detection, segmentation, classification, captioning) into a comprehensive expert matrix covering essential visual comprehension elements; 2) A dynamic knowledge fusion strategy featuring progressive pre-alignment to harmonize experts within the VLM latent space through contrastive learning, complemented by probabilistically activated stochastic residual connections to preserve knowledge continuity; 3) An enhanced optimization framework utilizing momentum contrastive learning for long-range dependency modeling and adaptive weight allocators for real-time expert contribution calibration. Extensive evaluations across 12 benchmark tasks spanning VQA, image captioning, and cross-modal retrieval demonstrate Astrea's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving an average performance gain of +4.7\%. This study provides the first empirical demonstration that progressive pre-alignment strategies enable VLMs to overcome task heterogeneity limitations, establishing new methodological foundations for developing general-purpose multimodal agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihua Tian, Sirun Nan, Ming Xu, Shengfang Zhai, Wenjie Qu, Jian Liu, Kui Ren, Ruoxi Jia, Jiaheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: https://github.com/NANSirun/Interpret-then-deactivate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image-guided surgery demands adaptive, real-time decision support, yet static AI models struggle with structured task planning and providing interactive guidance. Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling dynamic task planning and predictive decision support. We introduce SurgicalVLM-Agent, an AI co-pilot for image-guided pituitary surgery, capable of conversation, planning, and task execution. The agent dynamically processes surgeon queries and plans the tasks such as MRI tumor segmentation, endoscope anatomy segmentation, overlaying preoperative imaging with intraoperative views, instrument tracking, and surgical visual question answering (VQA). To enable structured task planning, we develop the PitAgent dataset, a surgical context-aware dataset covering segmentation, overlaying, instrument localization, tool tracking, tool-tissue interactions, phase identification, and surgical activity recognition. Additionally, we propose FFT-GaLore, a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based gradient projection technique for efficient low-rank adaptation, optimizing fine-tuning for LLaMA 3.2 in surgical environments. We validate SurgicalVLM-Agent by assessing task planning and prompt generation on our PitAgent dataset and evaluating zero-shot VQA using a public pituitary dataset. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in task planning and query interpretation, with highly semantically meaningful VQA responses, advancing AI-driven surgical assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beier Zhu, Jiequan Cui, Hanwang Zhang, Chi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While image-text foundation models have succeeded across diverse downstream tasks, they still face challenges in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. To address this issue, we propose a simple three-step approach,Project-Probe-Aggregate (PPA), that enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundation models without relying on group annotations. Building upon the failure-based debiasing scheme, our method, PPA, improves its two key components: minority samples identification and the robust training algorithm. Specifically, we first train biased classifiers by projecting image features onto the nullspace of class proxies from text encoders. Next, we infer group labels using the biased classifier and probe group targets with prior correction. Finally, we aggregate group weights of each class to produce the debiased classifier. Our theoretical analysis shows that our PPA enhances minority group identification and is Bayes optimal for minimizing the balanced group error, mitigating spurious correlations. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our PPA: it outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average worst-group accuracy while requiring less than 0.01% tunable parameters without training group labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zhou, Shouju Wang, Yuxia Tang, Qi Zhu, Daoqiang Zhang, Wei Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: The prediction of nanoparticles (NPs) distribution is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Recent studies indicate that the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) highly affects the distribution of NPs across tumors. Hence, it has become a research hotspot to generate the NPs distribution by the aid of multi-modal TME components. However, the distribution divergence among multi-modal TME components may cause side effects i.e., the best uni-modal model may outperform the joint generative model. To address the above issues, we propose a \textbf{D}ivergence-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Diffusion} model (i.e., \textbf{DAMM-Diffusion}) to adaptively generate the prediction results from uni-modal and multi-modal branches in a unified network. In detail, the uni-modal branch is composed of the U-Net architecture while the multi-modal branch extends it by introducing two novel fusion modules i.e., Multi-Modal Fusion Module (MMFM) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (UAFM). Specifically, the MMFM is proposed to fuse features from multiple modalities, while the UAFM module is introduced to learn the uncertainty map for cross-attention computation. Following the individual prediction results from each branch, the Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Predictor (DAMMP) module is proposed to assess the consistency of multi-modal data with the uncertainty map, which determines whether the final prediction results come from multi-modal or uni-modal predictions. We predict the NPs distribution given the TME components of tumor vessels and cell nuclei, and the experimental results show that DAMM-Diffusion can generate the distribution of NPs with higher accuracy than the comparing methods. Additional results on the multi-modal brain image synthesis task further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romain Thoreau, Valerio Marsocci, Dawa Derksen</p>
<p>Abstract: As large-scale heterogeneous data sets become increasingly available, adapting foundation models at low cost has become a key issue. Seminal works in natural language processing, e.g. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), leverage the low "intrinsic rank" of parameter updates during adaptation. In this paper, we argue that incorporating stronger inductive biases in both data and models can enhance the adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), pretrained on RGB satellite images, to other types of optical satellite data. Specifically, the pretrained parameters of GFMs serve as a strong prior for the spatial structure of multispectral images. For this reason, we introduce DEFLECT (Deflecting Embeddings for Finetuning Latent representations for Earth and Climate Tasks), a novel strategy for adapting GFMs to multispectral satellite imagery with very few additional parameters. DEFLECT improves the representation capabilities of the extracted features, particularly enhancing spectral information, which is essential for geoscience and environmental-related tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across three different GFMs and five diverse datasets, ranging from forest monitoring to marine environment segmentation. Compared to competing methods, DEFLECT achieves on-par or higher accuracy with 5-10$\times$ fewer parameters for classification and segmentation tasks. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09496">Robust Multimodal Survival Prediction with the Latent Differentiation Conditional Variational AutoEncoder</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Zhou, Jiao Tang, Yingli Zuo, Peng Wan, Daoqiang Zhang, Wei Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has received increasing attention for survival prediction of human cancers. However, the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities are available. As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data is high, which sometimes makes genomic data unavailable in testing samples. A common way of tackling such incompleteness is to generate the genomic representations from the pathology images. Nevertheless, such strategy still faces the following two challenges: (1) The gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) are huge and thus hard for representation. (2) It is difficult to generate the genomic embeddings with diverse function categories in a unified generative framework. To address the above challenges, we propose a Conditional Latent Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-CVAE) for robust multimodal survival prediction, even with missing genomic data. Specifically, a Variational Information Bottleneck Transformer (VIB-Trans) module is proposed to learn compressed pathological representations from the gigapixel WSIs. To generate different functional genomic features, we develop a novel Latent Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-VAE) to learn the common and specific posteriors for the genomic embeddings with diverse functions. Finally, we use the product-of-experts technique to integrate the genomic common posterior and image posterior for the joint latent distribution estimation in LD-CVAE. We test the effectiveness of our method on five different cancer datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority in both complete and missing modality scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) face challenges in achieving robust, transferable reasoning abilities due to reliance on labor-intensive manual instruction datasets or computationally expensive self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we introduce MindGYM, a framework that enhances VLMs through synthetic self-challenging questions, consisting of three stages: (1) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating cognitive questions across textual (e.g., logical deduction) and multimodal contexts (e.g., diagram-based queries) spanning eight semantic areas like ethical analysis; (2) Challenging Multi-Hop Question Synthesis, combining seed questions via diverse principles like bridging, visual-textual alignment, to create multi-step problems demanding deeper reasoning; and (3) Thinking-Induced Curriculum Fine-Tuning, a structured pipeline that progressively trains the model from scaffolded reasoning to standalone inference. By leveraging the model's self-synthesis capability, MindGYM achieves high data efficiency (e.g., +16% gains on MathVision-Mini with only 400 samples), computational efficiency (reducing both training and inference costs), and robust generalization across tasks. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with notable improvements (+15.77% win rates) in reasoning depth and breadth validated via GPT-based scoring. MindGYM underscores the viability of self-challenging for refining VLM capabilities while minimizing human intervention and resource demands. Code and data are released to advance multimodal reasoning research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Mamba networks (ViMs) extend the selective space state model (Mamba) to various vision tasks and demonstrate significant potential. Vector quantization (VQ), on the other hand, decomposes network weights into codebooks and assignments, significantly reducing memory usage and computational latency to enable ViMs deployment on edge devices. Although existing VQ methods have achieved extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit) in convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based networks, directly applying these methods to ViMs results in unsatisfactory accuracy. We identify several key challenges: 1) The weights of Mamba-based blocks in ViMs contain numerous outliers, significantly amplifying quantization errors. 2) When applied to ViMs, the latest VQ methods suffer from excessive memory consumption, lengthy calibration procedures, and suboptimal performance in the search for optimal codewords. In this paper, we propose ViM-VQ, an efficient post-training vector quantization method tailored for ViMs. ViM-VQ consists of two innovative components: 1) a fast convex combination optimization algorithm that efficiently updates both the convex combinations and the convex hulls to search for optimal codewords, and 2) an incremental vector quantization strategy that incrementally confirms optimal codewords to mitigate truncation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that ViM-VQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-bit quantization across various visual tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The image translation method represents a crucial approach for mitigating information deficiencies in the infrared and visible modalities, while also facilitating the enhancement of modality-specific datasets. However, existing methods for infrared and visible image translation either achieve unidirectional modality translation or rely on cycle consistency for bidirectional modality translation, which may result in suboptimal performance. In this work, we present the cross-modality translation diffusion model (CM-Diff) for simultaneously modeling data distributions in both the infrared and visible modalities. We address this challenge by combining translation direction labels for guidance during training with cross-modality feature control. Specifically, we view the establishment of the mapping relationship between the two modalities as the process of learning data distributions and understanding modality differences, achieved through a novel Bidirectional Diffusion Training (BDT) strategy. Additionally, we propose a Statistical Constraint Inference (SCI) strategy to ensure the generated image closely adheres to the data distribution of the target modality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our CM-Diff over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential for generating dual-modality datasets.</p>

STNHCL captures higher-order relationships among patches through hypergraph modeling, ensuring consistent higher-order topology between input and output images. Additionally, we introduce a novel negative sample weighting strategy that leverages discriminator heatmaps to apply different weights based on the Gaussian distribution for tissue and background, thereby enhancing traditional weighting methods. Experiments demonstrate that STNHCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in the two main categories of stain transfer tasks. Furthermore, our model also performs excellently in downstream tasks. Code will be made available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Chen, Pi Bu, Yingyao Wang, Xinyi Wang, Ziming Wang, Jie Guo, Yingxiu Zhao, Qi Zhu, Jun Song, Siran Yang, Jiamang Wang, Bo Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have expanded the capabilities of embodied intelligence. However, significant challenges remain in real-time decision-making in complex 3D environments, which demand second-level responses, high-resolution perception, and tactical reasoning under dynamic conditions. To advance the field, we introduce CombatVLA, an efficient VLA model optimized for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing games(ARPGs). Specifically, our CombatVLA is a 3B model trained on video-action pairs collected by an action tracker, where the data is formatted as action-of-thought (AoT) sequences. Thereafter, CombatVLA seamlessly integrates into an action execution framework, allowing efficient inference through our truncated AoT strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that CombatVLA not only outperforms all existing models on the combat understanding benchmark but also achieves a 50-fold acceleration in game combat. Moreover, it has a higher task success rate than human players. We will open-source all resources, including the action tracker, dataset, benchmark, model weights, training code, and the implementation of the framework at https://combatvla.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjae Chung, Jong Bum Won, Ganghyun Kim, Yujin Kim, Utku Ozbulak</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated superior performance in medical imaging problems, they face explainability issues similar to previous architectures such as convolutional neural networks. Recent research efforts suggest that attention maps, which are part of decision-making process of ViTs can potentially address the explainability issue by identifying regions influencing predictions, especially in models pretrained with self-supervised learning. In this work, we compare the visual explanations of attention maps to other commonly used methods for medical imaging problems. To do so, we employ four distinct medical imaging datasets that involve the identification of (1) colonic polyps, (2) breast tumors, (3) esophageal inflammation, and (4) bone fractures and hardware implants. Through large-scale experiments on the aforementioned datasets using various supervised and self-supervised pretrained ViTs, we find that although attention maps show promise under certain conditions and generally surpass GradCAM in explainability, they are outperformed by transformer-specific interpretability methods. Our findings indicate that the efficacy of attention maps as a method of interpretability is context-dependent and may be limited as they do not consistently provide the comprehensive insights required for robust medical decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuokang Huang, Julie A. McCann</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim B\"uchner, Christoph Anders, Orlando Guntinas-Lichius, Joachim Denzler</p>
<p>Abstract: The relationship between muscle activity and resulting facial expressions is crucial for various fields, including psychology, medicine, and entertainment. The synchronous recording of facial mimicry and muscular activity via surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a unique window into these complex dynamics. Unfortunately, existing methods for facial analysis cannot handle electrode occlusion, rendering them ineffective. Even with occlusion-free reference images of the same person, variations in expression intensity and execution are unmatchable. Our electromyography-informed facial expression reconstruction (EIFER) approach is a novel method to restore faces under sEMG occlusion faithfully in an adversarial manner. We decouple facial geometry and visual appearance (e.g., skin texture, lighting, electrodes) by combining a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with neural unpaired image-to-image translation via reference recordings. Then, EIFER learns a bidirectional mapping between 3DMM expression parameters and muscle activity, establishing correspondence between the two domains. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a dataset of synchronized sEMG recordings and facial mimicry, demonstrating faithful geometry and appearance reconstruction. Further, we synthesize expressions based on muscle activity and how observed expressions can predict dynamic muscle activity. Consequently, EIFER introduces a new paradigm for facial electromyography, which could be extended to other forms of multi-modal face recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingmin Ran, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of video diffusion models unveils a significant challenge: the substantial computational demands. To mitigate this challenge, we note that the reverse process of diffusion exhibits an inherent entropy-reducing nature. Given the inter-frame redundancy in video modality, maintaining full frame rates in high-entropy stages is unnecessary. Based on this insight, we propose TPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By dividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases frame rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on full frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the multi-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework: stage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our training strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances training efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the generality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x improvement in inference efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Mohaiminul Islam, Tushar Nagarajan, Huiyu Wang, Gedas Bertasius, Lorenzo Torresani</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) in long videos poses the key challenge of extracting relevant information and modeling long-range dependencies from many redundant frames. The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns. In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos. Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMBA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple long-form VQA benchmarks, including PerceptionTest, NExT-QA, EgoSchema, VNBench, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katrin Renz, Long Chen, Elahe Arani, Oleg Sinavski</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving has attracted significant attention with the hope of improving generalization and explainability. However, existing methods often focus on either driving or vision-language understanding but achieving both high driving performance and extensive language understanding remains challenging. In addition, the dominant approach to tackle vision-language understanding is using visual question answering. However, for autonomous driving, this is only useful if it is aligned with the action space. Otherwise, the model's answers could be inconsistent with its behavior. Therefore, we propose a model that can handle three different tasks: (1) closed-loop driving, (2) vision-language understanding, and (3) language-action alignment. Our model SimLingo is based on a vision language model (VLM) and works using only camera, excluding expensive sensors like LiDAR. SimLingo obtains state-of-the-art performance on the widely used CARLA simulator on the Bench2Drive benchmark and is the winning entry at the CARLA challenge 2024. Additionally, we achieve strong results in a wide variety of language-related tasks while maintaining high driving performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Oscar Michel, Xichen Pan, Sainan Liu, Mike Roberts, Saining Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video generation models excel in content creation but are not reliable as physically accurate world simulators out of the box. This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective technique for leveraging 2D diffusion priors for tasks such as text-to-3D generation. While powerful, SDS struggles with achieving fine-grained alignment to user intent. To overcome this, we introduce RewardSDS, a novel approach that weights noise samples based on alignment scores from a reward model, producing a weighted SDS loss. This loss prioritizes gradients from noise samples that yield aligned high-reward output. Our approach is broadly applicable and can extend SDS-based methods. In particular, we demonstrate its applicability to Variational Score Distillation (VSD) by introducing RewardVSD. We evaluate RewardSDS and RewardVSD on text-to-image, 2D editing, and text-to-3D generation tasks, showing significant improvements over SDS and VSD on a diverse set of metrics measuring generation quality and alignment to desired reward models, enabling state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Ke, Haohang Xu, Xuefei Ning, Yu Li, Jiajun Li, Haoling Li, Yuxuan Lin, Dongsheng Jiang, Yujiu Yang, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved significant progress in both image and video generation while still suffering from huge computation costs. As an effective solution, flow matching aims to reflow the diffusion process of diffusion models into a straight line for a few-step and even one-step generation. However, in this paper, we suggest that the original training pipeline of flow matching is not optimal and introduce two techniques to improve it. Firstly, we introduce progressive reflow, which progressively reflows the diffusion models in local timesteps until the whole diffusion progresses, reducing the difficulty of flow matching. Second, we introduce aligned v-prediction, which highlights the importance of direction matching in flow matching over magnitude matching. Experimental results on SDv1.5 and SDXL demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, for example, conducting on SDv1.5 achieves an FID of 10.70 on MSCOCO2014 validation set with only 4 sampling steps, close to our teacher model (32 DDIM steps, FID = 10.05).</p>

<p>Abstract: Event cameras provide superior temporal resolution, dynamic range, power efficiency, and pixel bandwidth. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally complement event data through discrete spike signals, making them ideal for event-based tracking. However, current approaches that combine Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, along with suboptimal architectures, compromise energy efficiency and limit tracking performance. To address these limitations, we propose the first Transformer-based spike-driven tracking pipeline. Our Global Trajectory Prompt (GTP) method effectively captures global trajectory information and aggregates it with event streams into event images to enhance spatiotemporal representation. We then introduce SDTrack, a Transformer-based spike-driven tracker comprising a Spiking MetaFormer backbone and a simple tracking head that directly predicts normalized coordinates using spike signals. The framework is end-to-end, does not require data augmentation or post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the lowest parameter count and energy consumption across multiple event-based tracking benchmarks, establishing a solid baseline for future research in the field of neuromorphic vision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Chen, Hongjun An, Zhe Sun, Tong Tian, Mingliang Chen, Christian Spielmann, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) achieves 2D image reconstruction through high-order correlation of 1D bucket signals and 2D light field information, particularly demonstrating enhanced detection sensitivity and high-quality image reconstruction via efficient photon collection in scattering media. Recent investigations have established that deep learning (DL) can substantially enhance the ghost imaging reconstruction quality. Furthermore, with the emergence of large models like SDXL, GPT-4, etc., the constraints of conventional DL in parameters and architecture have been transcended, enabling models to comprehensively explore relationships among all distinct positions within feature sequences. This paradigm shift has significantly advanced the capability of DL in restoring severely degraded and low-resolution imagery, making it particularly advantageous for noise-robust image reconstruction in GI applications. In this paper, we propose the first large imaging model with 1.4 billion parameters that incorporates the physical principles of GI (GILM). The proposed GILM implements a skip connection mechanism to mitigate gradient explosion challenges inherent in deep architectures, ensuring sufficient parametric capacity to capture intricate correlations among object single-pixel measurements. Moreover, GILM leverages multi-head attention mechanism to learn spatial dependencies across pixel points during image reconstruction, facilitating the extraction of comprehensive object information for subsequent reconstruction. We validated the effectiveness of GILM through a series of experiments, including simulated object imaging, imaging objects in free space, and imaging object located 52 meters away in underwater environment. The experimental results show that GILM effectively analyzes the fluctuation trends of the collected signals, thereby optimizing the recovery of the object's image from the acquired data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christiaan Boerkamp, Akhil John Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly tumor segmentation, is a critical task in medical imaging, with U-Net being a widely adopted convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this purpose. However, U-Net's high computational and memory requirements pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as wearable medical systems. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing QuantU-Net, a quantized version of U-Net optimized for efficient deployment on low-power devices like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Using Brevitas, a PyTorch library for quantization-aware training, we quantize the U-Net model, reducing its precision to an average of 4.24 bits while maintaining a validation accuracy of 94.25%, only 1.89% lower than the floating-point baseline. The quantized model achieves an approximately 8x reduction in size, making it suitable for real-time applications in wearable medical devices. We employ a custom loss function that combines Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss, Dice Loss, and a bitwidth loss function to optimize both segmentation accuracy and the size of the model. Using this custom loss function, we have significantly reduced the training time required to find an optimal combination of bitwidth and accuracy from a hypothetical 6^23 number of training sessions to a single training session. The model's usage of integer arithmetic highlights its potential for deployment on FPGAs and other designated AI accelerator hardware. This work advances the field of medical image segmentation by enabling the deployment of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices, paving the way for real-time, low-power diagnostic solutions in wearable healthcare applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) is a popular method for learning multimodal latent spaces with well-organized semantics. Despite its wide range of applications, CLIP's latent space is known to fail at handling complex visual-textual interactions. Recent works attempt to address its shortcomings with data-centric or algorithmic approaches. But what if the problem is more fundamental, and lies in the geometry of CLIP? Toward this end, we rigorously analyze CLIP's latent space properties, and prove that no CLIP-like joint embedding space exists which can correctly do any two of the following at the same time: 1. represent basic descriptions and image content, 2. represent attribute binding, 3. represent spatial location and relationships, 4. represent negation. Informed by this analysis, we propose Dense Cosine Similarity Maps (DCSMs) as a principled and interpretable scoring method for CLIP-like models, which solves the fundamental limitations of CLIP by retaining the semantic topology of the image patches and text tokens. This method improves upon the performance of classical CLIP-like joint encoder models on a wide array of benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanhuan Zhao, Ruben Millan Solsona, Marti Checa, Spenser R. Brown, Jennifer L. Morrell-Falvey, Liam Collins, Arpan Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Microscopy is an essential tool in scientific research, enabling the visualization of structures at micro- and nanoscale resolutions. However, the field of microscopy often encounters limitations in field-of-view (FOV), restricting the amount of sample that can be imaged in a single capture. To overcome this limitation, image stitching techniques have been developed to seamlessly merge multiple overlapping images into a single, high-resolution composite. The images collected from microscope need to be optimally stitched before accurate physical information can be extracted from post analysis. However, the existing stitching tools either struggle to stitch images together when the microscopy images are feature sparse or cannot address all the transformations of images. To address these issues, we propose a bi-channel aided feature-based image stitching method and demonstrate its use on AFM generated biofilm images. The topographical channel image of AFM data captures the morphological details of the sample, and a stitched topographical image is desired for researchers. We utilize the amplitude channel of AFM data to maximize the matching features and to estimate the position of the original topographical images and show that the proposed bi-channel aided stitching method outperforms the traditional stitching approach. Furthermore, we found that the differentiation of the topographical images along the x-axis provides similar feature information to the amplitude channel image, which generalizes our approach when the amplitude images are not available. Here we demonstrated the application on AFM, but similar approaches could be employed of optical microscopy with brightfield and fluorescence channels. We believe this proposed workflow will benefit the experimentalist to avoid erroneous analysis and discovery due to incorrect stitching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Zhou, Wei Pu, Miguel Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) unmixing is a challenging research problem that tries to identify the constituent components, known as endmembers, and their corresponding proportions, known as abundances, in the scene by analysing images captured by hyperspectral cameras. Recently, many deep learning based unmixing approaches have been proposed with the surge of machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, these methods face two notable challenges: 1. They frequently yield results lacking physical significance, such as signatures corresponding to unknown or non-existent materials. 2. CNNs, as general-purpose network structures, are not explicitly tailored for unmixing tasks. In response to these concerns, our work draws inspiration from double deep image prior (DIP) techniques and algorithm unrolling, presenting a novel network structure that effectively addresses both issues. Specifically, we first propose a MatrixConv Unmixing (MCU) approach for endmember and abundance estimation, respectively, which can be solved via certain iterative solvers. We then unroll these solvers to build two sub-networks, endmember estimation DIP (UEDIP) and abundance estimation DIP (UADIP), to generate the estimation of endmember and abundance, respectively. The overall network is constructed by assembling these two sub-networks. In order to generate meaningful unmixing results, we also propose a composite loss function. To further improve the unmixing quality, we also add explicitly a regularizer for endmember and abundance estimation, respectively. The proposed methods are tested for effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>

However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. These findings highlight the potential of scalable variational quantum machine learning models for SISR, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyun Yang, Fangjie Li, Jiayi Xu, Zixuan Liu, Sindhura Sridhar, Whitney Jin, Jennifer Du, Jon Heiselman, Michael Miga, Michael Topf, Jie Ying Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has one of the highest rates of recurrence cases among solid malignancies. Recurrence rates can be reduced by improving positive margins localization. Frozen section analysis (FSA) of resected specimens is the gold standard for intraoperative margin assessment. However, because of the complex 3D anatomy and the significant shrinkage of resected specimens, accurate margin relocation from specimen back onto the resection site based on FSA results remains challenging. We propose a novel deformable registration framework that uses both the pre-resection upper surface and the post-resection site of the specimen to incorporate thickness information into the registration process. The proposed method significantly improves target registration error (TRE), demonstrating enhanced adaptability to thicker specimens. In tongue specimens, the proposed framework improved TRE by up to 33% as compared to prior deformable registration. Notably, tongue specimens exhibit complex 3D anatomies and hold the highest clinical significance compared to other head and neck specimens from the buccal and skin. We analyzed distinct deformation behaviors in different specimens, highlighting the need for tailored deformation strategies. To further aid intraoperative visualization, we also integrated this framework with an augmented reality-based auto-alignment system. The combined system can accurately and automatically overlay the deformed 3D specimen mesh with positive margin annotation onto the resection site. With a pilot study of the AR guided framework involving two surgeons, the integrated system improved the surgeons' average target relocation error from 9.8 cm to 4.8 cm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md baharul Islam, Afsana Ahsan Jeny</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing learning-based video compression methods still face challenges related to inaccurate motion estimates and inadequate motion compensation structures. These issues result in compression errors and a suboptimal rate-distortion trade-off. To address these challenges, this work presents an end-to-end video compression method that incorporates several key operations. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder-type network with a residual skip connection to efficiently compress motion information. Additionally, we design motion vector and residual frame filtering networks to mitigate compression errors in the video compression system. To improve the effectiveness of the motion compensation network, we utilize powerful nonlinear transforms, such as the Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU), to delve deeper into the motion compensation architecture. Furthermore, a buffer is introduced to fine-tune the previous reference frames, thereby enhancing the reconstructed frame quality. These modules are combined with a carefully designed loss function that assesses the trade-off and enhances the overall video quality of the decoded output. Experimental results showcase the competitive performance of our method on various datasets, including HEVC (sequences B, C, and D), UVG, VTL, and MCL-JCV. The proposed approach tackles the challenges of accurate motion estimation and motion compensation in video compression, and the results highlight its competitive performance compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Alchihabi, Hanping Zhang, Yuhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving sequential decision-making problems. However, in real-world scenarios, RL agents often struggle to generalize when faced with unseen actions that were not encountered during training. Some previous works on zero-shot action generalization rely on large datasets of action observations to capture the behaviors of new actions, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel zero-shot framework, Action Generalization from Limited Observations (AGLO). Our framework has two main components: an action representation learning module and a policy learning module. The action representation learning module extracts discriminative embeddings of actions from limited observations, while the policy learning module leverages the learned action representations, along with augmented synthetic action representations, to learn a policy capable of handling tasks with unseen actions. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot action generalization across multiple benchmark tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in generalizing to new actions with minimal action observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Terris, Samuel Hurault, Maxime Song, Julian Tachella</p>
<p>Abstract: Most existing learning-based methods for solving imaging inverse problems can be roughly divided into two classes: iterative algorithms, such as plug-and-play and diffusion methods, that leverage pretrained denoisers, and unrolled architectures that are trained end-to-end for specific imaging problems. Iterative methods in the first class are computationally costly and often provide suboptimal reconstruction performance, whereas unrolled architectures are generally specific to a single inverse problem and require expensive training. In this work, we propose a novel non-iterative, lightweight architecture that incorporates knowledge about the forward operator (acquisition physics and noise parameters) without relying on unrolling. Our model is trained to solve a wide range of inverse problems beyond denoising, including deblurring, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, inpainting, and super-resolution. The proposed model can be easily adapted to unseen inverse problems or datasets with a few fine-tuning steps (up to a few images) in a self-supervised way, without ground-truth references. Throughout a series of experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance from medical imaging to low-photon imaging and microscopy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teran Bukenberger, Brent Davis</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye tracking has been found to be useful in various tasks including diagnostic and screening tools. However, traditional eye trackers had a complicated setup and operated at a higher frequency to measure eye movements. The use of more commonly available eye trackers such as those in head-mounted virtual reality (VR) headsets greatly expands the utility of these eye trackers for research and analytical purposes. In this study, the research question is focused on detecting saccades, which is a common task when analyzing eye tracking data, but it is not well-established for VR headset-mounted eye trackers. The aim is to determine how accurately saccadic eye movements can be detected using an eye tracker that operates at 60 or 90Hz. The study involves VR eye tracking technology and neuroscience with respect to saccadic eye movements. The goal is to build prototype software implemented using VR eye tracking technology to detect saccadic eye movements, and per-eye differences in an individual. It is anticipated that the software will be able to accurately detect when saccades occur and analyze the differences in saccadic eye movements per-eye. The field of research surrounding VR eye tracking software is still developing rapidly, specifically its applications to neuroscience. Since previous methods of eye tracking involved specialized equipment, using commercially and consumer available VR eye tracking technology to assist in the detection of saccades and per-eye differences would be novel. This project will impact the field of neuroscience by providing a tool that can be used to detect saccadic eye movements and neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. However, this project is limited by the short time frame and that the eye tracker used in this study operates at a maximum frequency of 90Hz.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hrishikesh Viswanath, Md Ashiqur Rahman, Chi Lin, Damon Conover, Aniket Bera</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient 3D mapping of large-scale outdoor environments from LiDAR measurements is a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly towards ensuring smooth and artifact-free surface reconstructions. Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$-Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Rene Cuellar Buritica, Vu Dinh, Manjula Burri, Julie Roelandts, James Wendling, Jon D. Klingensmith</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies on echocardiogram segmentation are focused on the left ventricle in parasternal long-axis views. In this study, deep-learning models were evaluated on the segmentation of the ventricles in parasternal short-axis echocardiograms (PSAX-echo). Segmentation of the ventricles in complementary echocardiogram views will allow the computation of important metrics with the potential to aid in diagnosing cardio-pulmonary diseases and other cardiomyopathies. Evaluating state-of-the-art models with small datasets can reveal if they improve performance on limited data. PSAX-echo were performed on 33 volunteer women. An experienced cardiologist identified end-diastole and end-systole frames from 387 scans, and expert observers manually traced the contours of the cardiac structures. Traced frames were pre-processed and used to create labels to train 2 specific-domain (Unet-Resnet101 and Unet-ResNet50), and 4 general-domain (3 Segment Anything (SAM) variants, and the Detectron2) deep-learning models. The performance of the models was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and difference in cross-sectional area (DCSA). The Unet-Resnet101 model provided superior performance in the segmentation of the ventricles with 0.83, 4.93 pixels, and 106 pixel2 on average for DSC, HD, and DCSA respectively. A fine-tuned MedSAM model provided a performance of 0.82, 6.66 pixels, and 1252 pixel2, while the Detectron2 model provided 0.78, 2.12 pixels, and 116 pixel2 for the same metrics respectively. Deep-learning models are suitable for the segmentation of the left and right ventricles in PSAX-echo. This study demonstrated that specific-domain trained models such as Unet-ResNet provide higher accuracy for echo segmentation than general-domain segmentation models when working with small and locally acquired datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuhiro Matsuyama, Usman Anjum, Satoko Matsuyama, Tetsuo Shoda, Justin Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a technique to imitate a performance that a deep learning model has, but reduce the size on another model. It applies the outputs of a model to train another model having comparable accuracy. These two distinct models are similar to the way information is delivered in human society, with one acting as the "teacher" and the other as the "student". Softmax plays a role in comparing logits generated by models with each other by converting probability distributions. It delivers the logits of a teacher to a student with compression through a parameter named temperature. Tuning this variable reinforces the distillation performance. Although only this parameter helps with the interaction of logits, it is not clear how temperatures promote information transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to calculate the temperature. Our method only refers to the maximum logit generated by a teacher model, which reduces computational time against state-of-the-art methods. Our method shows a promising result in different student and teacher models on a standard benchmark dataset. Algorithms using temperature can obtain the improvement by plugging in this dynamic approach. Furthermore, the approximation of the distillation process converges to a correlation of logits by both models. This reinforces the previous argument that the distillation conveys the relevance of logits. We report that this approximating algorithm yields a higher temperature compared to the commonly used static values in testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alvin Kimbowa, Arjun Parmar, Maziar Badii, David Liu, Matthew Harkey, Ilker Hacihaliloglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated knee cartilage segmentation using point-of-care ultrasound devices and deep-learning networks has the potential to enhance the management of knee osteoarthritis. However, segmentation algorithms often struggle with domain shifts caused by variations in ultrasound devices and acquisition parameters, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we propose Mono2D, a monogenic layer that extracts multi-scale, contrast- and intensity-invariant local phase features using trainable bandpass quadrature filters. This layer mitigates domain shifts, improving generalization to out-of-distribution domains. Mono2D is integrated before the first layer of a segmentation network, and its parameters jointly trained alongside the network's parameters. We evaluated Mono2D on a multi-domain 2D ultrasound knee cartilage dataset for single-source domain generalization (SSDG). Our results demonstrate that Mono2D outperforms other SSDG methods in terms of Dice score and mean average surface distance. To further assess its generalizability, we evaluate Mono2D on a multi-site prostate MRI dataset, where it continues to outperform other SSDG methods, highlighting its potential to improve domain generalization in medical imaging. Nevertheless, further evaluation on diverse datasets is still necessary to assess its clinical utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeongchan Lee, Sehyun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In self-supervised representation learning, Siamese networks are a natural architecture for learning transformation-invariance by bringing representations of positive pairs closer together. But it is prone to collapse into a degenerate solution. To address the issue, in contrastive learning, a contrastive loss is used to prevent collapse by moving representations of negative pairs away from each other. But it is known that algorithms with negative sampling are not robust to a reduction in the number of negative samples. So, on the other hand, there are algorithms that do not use negative pairs. Many positive-only algorithms adopt asymmetric network architecture consisting of source and target encoders as a key factor in coping with collapse. By exploiting the asymmetric architecture, we introduce a methodology to implicitly incorporate the idea of contrastive learning. As its implementation, we present a novel method guided stop-gradient. We apply our method to benchmark algorithms SimSiam and BYOL and show that our method stabilizes training and boosts performance. We also show that the algorithms with our method work well with small batch sizes and do not collapse even when there is no predictor. The code is available at https://github.com/bych-lee/gsg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Gong, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Jiangxuan Long, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, offering computational advantages over diffusion models by leveraging deterministic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) instead of stochastic dynamics. While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Junchi Liao, Weimin Lyu, Shaopeng Fu, Tianhao Huang, Shu Yang, Guimin Hu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, enabling adversaries to embed hidden triggers that manipulate the behavior of the model during inference. Traditional backdoor attacks typically rely on inserting explicit triggers (e.g., external patches, or perturbations) into input data, but they often struggle to evade existing defense mechanisms. To address this limitation, we investigate backdoor attacks through the lens of the reasoning process in deep learning systems, drawing insights from interpretable AI. We conceptualize backdoor activation as the manipulation of learned concepts within the model's latent representations. Thus, existing attacks can be seen as implicit manipulations of these activated concepts during inference. This raises interesting questions: why not manipulate the concepts explicitly? This idea leads to our novel backdoor attack framework, Concept Confusion Attack (C^2 ATTACK), which leverages internal concepts in the model's reasoning as "triggers" without introducing explicit external modifications. By avoiding the use of real triggers and directly activating or deactivating specific concepts in latent spaces, our approach enhances stealth, making detection by existing defenses significantly harder. Using CLIP as a case study, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of C^2 ATTACK, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining robustness against advanced defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of robotics technology, some tactile sensors, such as vision-based sensors, have been applied to contact-rich robotics tasks. However, the durability of vision-based tactile sensors significantly increases the cost of tactile information acquisition. Utilizing simulation to generate tactile data has emerged as a reliable approach to address this issue. While data-driven methods for tactile data generation lack robustness, finite element methods (FEM) based approaches require significant computational costs. To address these issues, we integrated a pinhole camera model into the low computational cost vision-based tactile simulator Tacchi that used the Material Point Method (MPM) as the simulated method, completing the simulation of marker motion images. We upgraded Tacchi and introduced Tacchi 2.0. This simulator can simulate tactile images, marked motion images, and joint images under different motion states like pressing, slipping, and rotating. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability of our method and its robustness across various vision-based tactile sensors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is among the most popular neighbor embedding methods. The method relies on attractive and repulsive forces among high-dimensional data points to obtain a low-dimensional embedding. In this paper, we analyze the forces to reveal their effects on cluster formations and visualization. Repulsion emphasizes differences, controlling cluster boundaries and inter-cluster distance. Attraction is more subtle, as attractive tension between points can manifest simultaneously as attraction and repulsion in the lower-dimensional mapping. This explains the need for learning rate annealing and motivates the different treatments between attractive and repulsive terms. Moreover, by modifying attraction, we improve the consistency of cluster formation under random initialization. Overall, our analysis makes UMAP and similar embedding methods more interpretable, more robust, and more accurate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Li, Ziqiang He, Anwei Luo, Jian-Fang Hu, Z. Jane Wang, Xiangui Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Imperceptible adversarial attacks aim to fool DNNs by adding imperceptible perturbation to the input data. Previous methods typically improve the imperceptibility of attacks by integrating common attack paradigms with specifically designed perception-based losses or the capabilities of generative models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a novel modeling framework distinct from existing attack paradigms. AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of regular diffusion models requiring neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example. Grounded in a solid theoretical foundation of the proposed non-parametric diffusion process, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower overall perturbation strength. Additionally, an enhanced version AdvAD-X is proposed to evaluate the extreme of our novel framework under an ideal scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvAD and AdvAD-X. Compared with state-of-the-art imperceptible attacks, AdvAD achieves an average of 99.9$\%$ (+17.3$\%$) ASR with 1.34 (-0.97) $l_2$ distance, 49.74 (+4.76) PSNR and 0.9971 (+0.0043) SSIM against four prevalent DNNs with three different architectures on the ImageNet-compatible dataset.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents InteractEdit, a novel framework for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) editing, addressing the challenging task of transforming an existing interaction in an image into a new, desired interaction while preserving the identities of the subject and object. Unlike simpler image editing scenarios such as attribute manipulation, object replacement or style transfer, HOI editing involves complex spatial, contextual, and relational dependencies inherent in humans-objects interactions. Existing methods often overfit to the source image structure, limiting their ability to adapt to the substantial structural modifications demanded by new interactions. To address this, InteractEdit decomposes each scene into subject, object, and background components, then employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and selective fine-tuning to preserve pretrained interaction priors while learning the visual identity of the source image. This regularization strategy effectively balances interaction edits with identity consistency. We further introduce IEBench, the most comprehensive benchmark for HOI editing, which evaluates both interaction editing and identity preservation. Our extensive experiments show that InteractEdit significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for future HOI editing research and unlocking new possibilities for creative and practical applications. Code will be released upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuwen Fang, Mang Ye, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies a challenging robust federated learning task with model heterogeneous and data corrupted clients, where the clients have different local model structures. Data corruption is unavoidable due to factors such as random noise, compression artifacts, or environmental conditions in real-world deployment, drastically crippling the entire federated system. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Robust Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning (RAHFL) framework. We propose a Diversity-enhanced supervised Contrastive Learning technique to enhance the resilience and adaptability of local models on various data corruption patterns. Its basic idea is to utilize complex augmented samples obtained by the mixed-data augmentation strategy for supervised contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to learn robust and diverse feature representations. Furthermore, we design an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning strategy to resist corrupt feedback from external clients. The strategy allows clients to perform selective one-way learning during collaborative learning phase, enabling clients to refrain from incorporating lower-quality information from less robust or underperforming collaborators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in diverse, challenging federated learning environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihai Wu, Ziyu Zhu, Yuran Wang, Yue Chen, Jiarui Wang, Hao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Cluttered garments manipulation poses significant challenges due to the complex, deformable nature of garments and intricate garment relations. Unlike single-garment manipulation, cluttered scenarios require managing complex garment entanglements and interactions, while maintaining garment cleanliness and manipulation stability. To address these demands, we propose to learn point-level affordance, the dense representation modeling the complex space and multi-modal manipulation candidates, while being aware of garment geometry, structure, and inter-object relations. Additionally, as it is difficult to directly retrieve a garment in some extremely entangled clutters, we introduce an adaptation module, guided by learned affordance, to reorganize highly-entangled garments into states plausible for manipulation. Our framework demonstrates effectiveness over environments featuring diverse garment types and pile configurations in both simulation and the real world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhoutong Ye, Mingze Sun, Huan-ang Gao, Chun Yu, Yuanchun Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential as generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks. However, there remains a significant gap between state-of-the-art LMMs and human performance when it comes to complex tasks that require a combination of fundamental VL capabilities, as well as tasks involving the grounding of complex instructions. To thoroughly investigate the human-LMM gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a diverse benchmark with complex real-world VL tasks that are challenging for LMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist problem solving by integrating fundamental VL capabilities such as reading text, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual instructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that contains 10 fundamental VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a fine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses. Besides, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly evaluate LMMs' ability to ground complex text and visual instructions, which is essential to many real-world applications. We evaluate over 20 proprietary and open source LMMs, as well as humans, on MOAT, and found that humans achieved 82.7% accuracy while the best performing LMM (OpenAI o1) achieved only 38.8%. To guide future model development, we analyze common trends in our results and discuss the underlying causes of observed performance gaps between LMMs and humans, focusing on which VL capability forms the bottleneck in complex tasks, whether test time scaling improves performance on MOAT, and how tiling harms LMMs' capability to count.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kechun Xu, Xunlong Xia, Kaixuan Wang, Yifei Yang, Yunxuan Mao, Bing Deng, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the task of language-conditioned pick and place in clutter, where a robot should grasp a target object in open clutter and move it to a specified place. Some approaches learn end-to-end policies with features from vision foundation models, requiring large datasets. Others combine foundation models in a zero-shot setting, suffering from cascading errors. In addition, they primarily leverage vision and language foundation models, focusing less on action priors. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective policy by integrating foundation priors from vision, language, and action. We propose A$^2$, an action prior alignment method that aligns unconditioned action priors with 3D vision-language priors by learning one attention layer. The alignment formulation enables our policy to train with less data and preserve zero-shot generalization capabilities. We show that a shared policy for both pick and place actions enhances the performance for each task, and introduce a policy adaptation scheme to accommodate the multi-modal nature of actions. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real-world show that our policy achieves higher task success rates with fewer steps for both pick and place tasks in clutter, effectively generalizing to unseen objects and language instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saimouli Katragadda, Cho-Ying Wu, Yuliang Guo, Xinyu Huang, Guoquan Huang, Liu Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktor Nevelius Wernholm, Alfred W\"arns\"ater, Axel Ringh</p>
<p>Abstract: In multiple target tracking, it is important to be able to evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment metric (TGOSPA) is a recently proposed metric for such evaluations. The TGOSPA metric is computed as the solution to an optimization problem, but for large tracking scenarios, solving this problem becomes computationally demanding. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for evaluating the TGOSPA metric, based on casting the TGOSPA problem as an unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport problem. Following recent advances in computational optimal transport, we introduce an entropy regularization and derive an iterative scheme for solving the Lagrangian dual of the regularized problem. Numerical results suggest that our proposed algorithm is more computationally efficient than the alternative of computing the exact metric using a linear programming solver, while still providing an adequate approximation of the metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M\'at\'e T\'oth, P\'eter Kov\'acs, Zolt\'an Bendefy, Zolt\'an Hortsin, Bal\'azs Ter\'eki, Tam\'as Matuszka</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an unrolled algorithm approach for learning spatially adaptive parameter maps in the framework of convolutional synthesis-based $\ell_1$ regularization. More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify
  the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Healthcare relies on multiple types of data, such as medical images, genetic information, and clinical records, to improve diagnosis and treatment. However, missing data is a common challenge due to privacy restrictions, cost, and technical issues, making many existing multi-modal models unreliable. To address this, we propose a new multi-model model called Mixture of Experts, Symmetric Aligning, and Reconstruction (MoSARe), a deep learning framework that handles incomplete multimodal data while maintaining high accuracy. MoSARe integrates expert selection, cross-modal attention, and contrastive learning to improve feature representation and decision-making. Our results show that MoSARe outperforms existing models in situations when the data is complete. Furthermore, it provides reliable predictions even when some data are missing. This makes it especially useful in real-world healthcare settings, including resource-limited environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/NazaninMn/MoSARe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bakary Badjie, Jos\'e Cec\'ilio, Ant\'onio Casimiro</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has succeeded in deep learning (DL). However, its complex architecture and advantages over dense models in image classification remain unclear. In previous studies, MoE performance has often been affected by noise and outliers in the input space. Some approaches incorporate input clustering for training MoE models, but most clustering algorithms lack access to labeled data, limiting their effectiveness. This paper introduces the Double-stage Feature-level Clustering and Pseudo-labeling-based Mixture of Experts (DFCP-MoE) framework, which consists of input feature extraction, feature-level clustering, and a computationally efficient pseudo-labeling strategy. This approach reduces the impact of noise and outliers while leveraging a small subset of labeled data to label a large portion of unlabeled inputs. We propose a conditional end-to-end joint training method that improves expert specialization by training the MoE model on well-labeled, clustered inputs. Unlike traditional MoE and dense models, the DFCP-MoE framework effectively captures input space diversity, leading to competitive inference results. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets for multi-class classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Chen, Amir Aghabiglou, Shijie Chen, Motahare Torki, Chao Tang, Ruud B. van Heeswijk, Yves Wiaux</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving medical imaging data scarcity through semantic image generation has attracted significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited effectiveness for organs with fine-grained structure. Due to stringent topological consistency, fragile coronary features, and complex 3D morphological heterogeneity in cardiac imaging, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details of the heart remains a great challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose the Fine-grained Cardiac image Synthesis(FCaS) framework, established on 3D template conditional diffusion model. FCaS achieves precise cardiac structure generation using Template-guided Conditional Diffusion Model (TCDM) through bidirectional mechanisms, which provides the fine-grained topological structure information of target image through the guidance of template. Meanwhile, we design a deformable Mask Generation Module (MGM) to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality and diverse reference mask in the generation process. Furthermore, to alleviate the confusion caused by imprecise synthetic images, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy to facilitate the pre-training of downstream segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV) estimation to obtain confidence maps, which are subsequently employed to rectify the pre-training on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that images generated from FCaS achieves state-of-the-art performance in topological consistency and visual quality, which significantly facilitates the downstream tasks as well. Code will be released in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nannan Wu, Zhuo Kuang, Zengqiang Yan, Ping Wang, Li Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the potential of federated learning in medical applications, inconsistent imaging quality across institutions-stemming from lower-quality data from a minority of clients-biases federated models toward more common high-quality images. This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaocong Long, Qianyu Zhou, Chenhao Ying, Lizhuang Ma, Yuan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization under the distribution shift has been a great challenge in computer vision. The prevailing practice of directly employing the one-hot labels as the training targets in domain generalization~(DG) can lead to gradient conflicts, making it insufficient for capturing the intrinsic class characteristics and hard to increase the intra-class variation. Besides, existing methods in DG mostly overlook the distinct contributions of source (seen) domains, resulting in uneven learning from these domains. To address these issues, we firstly present a theoretical and empirical analysis of the existence of gradient conflicts in DG, unveiling the previously unexplored relationship between distribution shifts and gradient conflicts during the optimization process. In this paper, we present a novel perspective of DG from the empirical source domain's risk and propose a new paradigm for DG called Diverse Target and Contribution Scheduling (DTCS). DTCS comprises two innovative modules: Diverse Target Supervision (DTS) and Diverse Contribution Balance (DCB), with the aim of addressing the limitations associated with the common utilization of one-hot labels and equal contributions for source domains in DG. In specific, DTS employs distinct soft labels as training targets to account for various feature distributions across domains and thereby mitigates the gradient conflicts, and DCB dynamically balances the contributions of source domains by ensuring a fair decline in losses of different source domains. Extensive experiments with analysis on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves a competitive performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed DTCS.</p>

<p>Abstract: In contrast to conventional visual question answering, video-grounded dialog necessitates a profound understanding of both dialog history and video content for accurate response generation. Despite commendable progress made by existing approaches, they still face the challenges of incrementally understanding complex dialog history and assimilating video information. In response to these challenges, we present an iterative search and reasoning framework, which consists of a textual encoder, a visual encoder, and a generator. Specifically, we devise a path search and aggregation strategy in the textual encoder, mining core cues from dialog history that are pivotal to understanding the posed questions. Concurrently, our visual encoder harnesses an iterative reasoning network to extract and emphasize critical visual markers from videos, enhancing the depth of visual comprehension. Finally, we utilize the pre-trained GPT-2 model as our answer generator to decode the mined hidden clues into coherent and contextualized answers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) methods are capable of performing semantic segmentation without relying on a fixed vocabulary, and in some cases, without training or fine-tuning. However, OVS methods typically require a human in the loop to specify the vocabulary based on the task or dataset at hand. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (AVS), advancing open-ended image understanding by eliminating the necessity to predefine object categories for segmentation. Our approach, AutoSeg, presents a framework that autonomously identifies relevant class names using semantically enhanced BLIP embeddings and segments them afterwards. Given that open-ended object category predictions cannot be directly compared with a fixed ground truth, we develop a Large Language Model-based Auto-Vocabulary Evaluator (LAVE) to efficiently evaluate the automatically generated classes and their corresponding segments. With AVS, our method sets new benchmarks on datasets PASCAL VOC, Context, ADE20K, and Cityscapes, while showing competitive performance to OVS methods that require specified class names.</p>

CoMapGS addresses both high- and low-uncertainty regions by constructing covisibility maps, enhancing initial point clouds, and applying uncertainty-aware weighted supervision with a proximity classifier. Our contributions are threefold: (1) CoMapGS reframes novel view synthesis by leveraging covisibility maps as a core component to address region-specific uncertainty levels; (2) Enhanced initial point clouds for both low- and high-uncertainty regions compensate for sparse COLMAP-derived point clouds, improving reconstruction quality and benefiting few-shot 3DGS methods; (3) Adaptive supervision with covisibility-score-based weighting and proximity classification achieves consistent performance gains across scenes with various sparsity scores derived from covisibility maps.

<p>Abstract: Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) has shown excellent success owing to its efficiency and generalization in large-scale retrieval scenarios. While considerable success has been achieved, there still exist urgent limitations. Existing works ignore the locality relationships of representations and attributes, which have effective transferability between seeable classes and unseeable classes. Also, the continuous-value attributes are not fully harnessed. In response, we conduct a COMprehensive Attribute Exploration for ZSH, named COMAE, which depicts the relationships from seen classes to unseen ones through three meticulously designed explorations, i.e., point-wise, pair-wise and class-wise consistency constraints. By regressing attributes from the proposed attribute prototype network, COMAE learns the local features that are relevant to the visual attributes. Then COMAE utilizes contrastive learning to comprehensively depict the context of attributes, rather than instance-independent optimization. Finally, the class-wise constraint is designed to cohesively learn the hash code, image representation, and visual attributes more effectively. Experimental results on the popular ZSH datasets demonstrate that COMAE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing techniques, especially in scenarios with a larger number of unseen label classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Huang, Yiu-Ming Cheung, Chi-Man Vong</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Partial Label Learning (PLL) methods posit that training and test data adhere to the same distribution, a premise that frequently does not hold in practical application where Out-of-Distribution (OOD) objects are present. We introduce the OODPLL paradigm to tackle this significant yet underexplored issue. And our newly proposed PLOOD framework enables PLL to tackle OOD objects through Positive-Negative Sample Augmented (PNSA) feature learning and Partial Energy (PE)-based label refinement. The PNSA module enhances feature discrimination and OOD recognition by simulating in- and out-of-distribution instances, which employ structured positive and negative sample augmentation, in contrast to conventional PLL methods struggling to distinguish OOD samples. The PE scoring mechanism combines label confidence with energy-based uncertainty estimation, thereby reducing the impact of imprecise supervision and effectively achieving label disambiguation. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, alongside various OOD datasets, demonstrate that conventional PLL methods exhibit substantial degradation in OOD scenarios, underscoring the necessity of incorporating OOD considerations in PLL approaches. Ablation studies show that PNSA feature learning and PE-based label refinement are necessary for PLOOD to work, offering a robust solution for open-set PLL problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soikat Hasan Ahmed, Jan Finkbeiner, Emre Neftci</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range with minimal motion blur, making them promising for robust object detection. While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordy Van Landeghem, Subhajit Maity, Ayan Banerjee, Matthew Blaschko, Marie-Francine Moens, Josep Llad\'os, Sanket Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores knowledge distillation (KD) for visually-rich document (VRD) applications such as document layout analysis (DLA) and document image classification (DIC). While VRD research is dependent on increasingly sophisticated and cumbersome models, the field has neglected to study efficiency via model compression. Here, we design a KD experimentation methodology for more lean, performant models on document understanding (DU) tasks that are integral within larger task pipelines. We carefully selected KD strategies (response-based, feature-based) for distilling knowledge to and from backbones with different architectures (ResNet, ViT, DiT) and capacities (base, small, tiny). We study what affects the teacher-student knowledge gap and find that some methods (tuned vanilla KD, MSE, SimKD with an apt projector) can consistently outperform supervised student training. Furthermore, we design downstream task setups to evaluate covariate shift and the robustness of distilled DLA models on zero-shot layout-aware document visual question answering (DocVQA). DLA-KD experiments result in a large mAP knowledge gap, which unpredictably translates to downstream robustness, accentuating the need to further explore how to efficiently obtain more semantic document layout awareness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper scales object-level reconstruction to complex scenes, advancing interactive scene reconstruction. We introduce two datasets, OmniSim and InterReal, featuring 28 scenes with multiple interactive objects. To tackle the challenge of inaccurate interactive motion recovery in complex scenes, we propose LiveScene, a scene-level language-embedded interactive radiance field that efficiently reconstructs and controls multiple objects. By decomposing the interactive scene into local deformable fields, LiveScene enables separate reconstruction of individual object motions, reducing memory consumption. Additionally, our interaction-aware language embedding localizes individual interactive objects, allowing for arbitrary control using natural language. Our approach demonstrates significant superiority in novel view synthesis, interactive scene control, and language grounding performance through extensive experiments.

<p>Abstract: Existing research on avatar creation is typically limited to laboratory datasets, which require high costs against scalability and exhibit insufficient representation of the real world. On the other hand, the web abounds with off-the-shelf real-world human videos, but these videos vary in quality and require accurate annotations for avatar creation. To this end, we propose an automatic annotating pipeline with filtering protocols to curate these humans from the web. Our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the EMDB benchmark, and the filtering protocols boost verification metrics on web videos. We then curate WildAvatar, a web-scale in-the-wild human avatar creation dataset extracted from YouTube, with $10000+$ different human subjects and scenes. WildAvatar is at least $10\times$ richer than previous datasets for 3D human avatar creation and closer to the real world. To explore its potential, we demonstrate the quality and generalizability of avatar creation methods on WildAvatar. We will publicly release our code, data source links and annotations to push forward 3D human avatar creation and other related fields for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufan Shen, Chuwei Luo, Zhaoqing Zhu, Yang Chen, Qi Zheng, Zhi Yu, Jiajun Bu, Cong Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results on document visual question answering (VQA) task, particularly after training on document instruction datasets. An effective evaluation method for document instruction data is crucial in constructing instruction data with high efficacy, which, in turn, facilitates the training of LLMs and MLLMs for document VQA. However, most existing evaluation methods for instruction data are limited to the textual content of the instructions themselves, thereby hindering the effective assessment of document instruction datasets and constraining their construction. In this paper, we propose ProcTag, a data-oriented method that assesses the efficacy of document instruction data. ProcTag innovatively performs tagging on the execution process of instructions rather than the instruction text itself. By leveraging the diversity and complexity of these tags to assess the efficacy of the given dataset, ProcTag enables selective sampling or filtering of document instructions. Furthermore, DocLayPrompt, a novel semi-structured layout-aware document prompting strategy, is proposed for effectively representing documents. Experiments demonstrate that sampling existing open-sourced and generated document VQA/instruction datasets with ProcTag significantly outperforms current methods for evaluating instruction data. Impressively, with ProcTag-based sampling in the generated document datasets, only 30.5\% of the document instructions are required to achieve 100\% efficacy compared to the complete dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifan Zhang, Yunhui Guo, Yu Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the problem of continual distillation learning (CDL) in order to use knowledge distillation (KD) to improve prompt-based continual learning (CL) models. The CDL problem is valuable to study since the use of a larger vision transformer (ViT) leads to better performance in prompt-based continual learning. The distillation of knowledge from a large ViT to a small ViT can improve the inference efficiency for prompt-based CL models. We empirically found that existing KD methods such as logit distillation and feature distillation cannot effectively improve the student model in the CDL setup. To this end, we introduce a novel method named Knowledge Distillation based on Prompts (KDP), in which globally accessible prompts specifically designed for knowledge distillation are inserted into the frozen ViT backbone of the student model. We demonstrate that our KDP method effectively enhances the distillation performance in comparison to existing KD methods in the CDL setup.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechao Chen, Ying Chen, Jialin Li, Qiang Nie, Hanqiu Deng, Yong Liu, Qixing Huang, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training in 3D is pivotal for advancing 3D perception tasks. However, the scarcity of clean 3D data poses significant challenges for scaling 3D pre-training efforts. Drawing inspiration from semi-supervised learning, which effectively combines limited labeled data with abundant unlabeled data, we introduce an innovative self-supervised pre-training framework. This framework leverages both authentic 3D data and pseudo-3D data generated from images using a robust depth estimation model. Another critical challenge is the efficiency of the pre-training process. Existing approaches, such as Point-BERT and Point-MAE, utilize k-nearest neighbors for 3D token embedding, resulting in quadratic time complexity. To address this, we propose a novel token embedding strategy with linear time complexity, coupled with a training-efficient 2D reconstruction target. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D classification, detection, and few-shot learning but also ensures high efficiency in both pre-training and downstream fine-tuning processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of scene text in both structured and unstructured environments presents significant challenges in optical character recognition (OCR), necessitating more efficient and robust text spotting solutions. This paper presents FastTextSpotter, a framework that integrates a Swin Transformer visual backbone with a Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture, enhanced by a novel, faster self-attention unit, SAC2, to improve processing speeds while maintaining accuracy. FastTextSpotter has been validated across multiple datasets, including ICDAR2015 for regular texts and CTW1500 and TotalText for arbitrary-shaped texts, benchmarking against current state-of-the-art models. Our results indicate that FastTextSpotter not only achieves superior accuracy in detecting and recognizing multilingual scene text (English and Vietnamese) but also improves model efficiency, thereby setting new benchmarks in the field. This study underscores the potential of advanced transformer architectures in improving the adaptability and speed of text spotting applications in diverse real-world settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leqi Shen, Tianxiang Hao, Tao He, Sicheng Zhao, Yifeng Zhang, Pengzhang Liu, Yongjun Bao, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Most text-video retrieval methods utilize the text-image pre-trained models like CLIP as a backbone. These methods process each sampled frame independently by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenny Seidenschwarz, Qunjie Zhou, Bardienus Duisterhof, Deva Ramanan, Laura Leal-Taix\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing scenes and tracking motion are two sides of the same coin. Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [14], while geometric reconstruction of (dynamic) scenes allows for 3D tracking of points over time [24, 39]. The latter was recently also exploited for 2D point tracking to overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [38]. However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view camera setups both unrealistic for real-world applications like robot navigation or mixed reality. We target the challenge of online 2D and 3D point tracking from unposed monocular camera input introducing Dynamic Online Monocular Reconstruction (DynOMo). We leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes in an online fashion. Our approach extends 3D Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any correspondence-level supervision. It sets the first baseline for online point tracking with monocular unposed cameras, achieving performance on par with existing methods. We aim to inspire the community to advance online point tracking and reconstruction, expanding the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection poses a significant challenge due to the requirement to discern minute targets amidst complex infrared background clutter. In this paper, we focus on a weakly-supervised paradigm to obtain high-quality pseudo masks from the point-level annotation by integrating a novel learning-free method with the hybrid of the learning-based method. The learning-free method adheres to a sequential process, progressing from a point annotation to the bounding box that encompasses the target, and subsequently to detailed pseudo masks, while the hybrid is achieved through filtering out false alarms and retrieving missed detections in the network's prediction to provide a reliable supplement for learning-free masks. The experimental results show that our learning-free method generates pseudo masks with an average Intersection over Union (IoU) that is 4.3% higher than the second-best learning-free competitor across three datasets, while the hybrid learning-based method further enhances the quality of pseudo masks, achieving an additional average IoU increase of 3.4%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have yielded promising results for the image shadow removal task. However, most existing methods rely on binary pre-generated shadow masks. The binary nature of such masks could potentially lead to artifacts near the boundary between shadow and non-shadow areas. In view of this, inspired by the physical model of shadow formation, we introduce novel soft shadow masks specifically designed for shadow removal. To achieve such soft masks, we propose a SoftShadow framework by leveraging the prior knowledge of pretrained SAM and integrating physical constraints. Specifically, we jointly tune the SAM and the subsequent shadow removal network using penumbra formation constraint loss, mask reconstruction loss, and shadow removal loss. This framework enables accurate predictions of penumbra (partially shaded) and umbra (fully shaded) areas while simultaneously facilitating end-to-end shadow removal. Through extensive experiments on popular datasets, we found that our SoftShadow framework, which generates soft masks, can better restore boundary artifacts, achieve state-of-the-art performance, and demonstrate superior generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The creation of 3D human face avatars from a single unconstrained image is a fundamental task that underlies numerous real-world vision and graphics applications. Despite the significant progress made in generative models, existing methods are either less suited in design for human faces or fail to generalise from the restrictive training domain to unconstrained facial images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, Gen3D-Face, which generates 3D human faces with unconstrained single image input within a multi-view consistent diffusion framework. Given a specific input image, our model first produces multi-view images, followed by neural surface construction. To incorporate face geometry information in a generalisable manner, we utilise input-conditioned mesh estimation instead of ground-truth mesh along with synthetic multi-view training data. Importantly, we introduce a multi-view joint generation scheme to enhance appearance consistency among different views. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt and benchmark for creating photorealistic 3D human face avatars from single images for generic human subject across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous alternatives for out-of-domain singe image 3D face generation and top competition for in-domain setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingdong Hu, Zhening Liu, Jiawei Shao, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time novel view synthesis for human models. However, current approaches are confined to either dense viewpoint configurations or restricted image resolutions. These limitations hinder their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies, and also restrict their ability to recover fine-grained human details in real time using commonly available GPUs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse multi-view camera settings. Specifically, we first design an Efficient Cross-View Attention (EVA) module to effectively fuse cross-view information under high resolution inputs and sparse view settings, while minimizing temporal and computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a feature refinement mechianism to predict the attributes of the 3D Gaussians and assign a feature value to each Gaussian, enabling the correction of artifacts caused by geometric inaccuracies in position estimation and enhancing overall visual fidelity. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of EVA-Gaussian in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

<p>Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo R. Corral-Soto, Yang Liu, Tongtong Cao, Yuan Ren, Liu Bingbing</p>
<p>Abstract: In Autonomous Driving (AD) Perception, cyclists are considered safety-critical scene objects. Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video depth estimation has long been hindered by the scarcity of consistent and scalable ground truth data, leading to inconsistent and unreliable results. In this paper, we introduce Depth Any Video, a model that tackles the challenge through two key innovations. First, we develop a scalable synthetic data pipeline, capturing real-time video depth data from diverse virtual environments, yielding 40,000 video clips of 5-second duration, each with precise depth annotations. Second, we leverage the powerful priors of generative video diffusion models to handle real-world videos effectively, integrating advanced techniques such as rotary position encoding and flow matching to further enhance flexibility and efficiency. Unlike previous models, which are limited to fixed-length video sequences, our approach introduces a novel mixed-duration training strategy that handles videos of varying lengths and performs robustly across different frame rates-even on single frames. At inference, we propose a depth interpolation method that enables our model to infer high-resolution video depth across sequences of up to 150 frames. Our model outperforms all previous generative depth models in terms of spatial accuracy and temporal consistency. The code and model weights are open-sourced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Nagar, Girish Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm to optimize the inverse of the convolution layer, resulting in fast training times. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghyuk Chun, Wonjae Kim, Song Park, Sangdoo Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyao Lv, Chenyang Si, Junhao Song, Zhenyu Yang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu, Kwan-Yee K. Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present \textbf{\textit{FasterCache}}, a novel training-free strategy designed to accelerate the inference of video diffusion models with high-quality generation. By analyzing existing cache-based methods, we observe that \textit{directly reusing adjacent-step features degrades video quality due to the loss of subtle variations}. We further perform a pioneering investigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional features within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we introduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video generation. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that preserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which optimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance inference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate FasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that FasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\eg 1.67$\times$ speedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the baseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed and video quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanqi Pu, Yifan Wang, Jiru Deng, Wenming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Perspective projection has been extensively utilized in monocular 3D object detection methods. It introduces geometric priors from 2D bounding boxes and 3D object dimensions to reduce the uncertainty of depth estimation. However, due to depth errors originating from the object's visual surface, the height of the bounding box often fails to represent the actual projected central height, which undermines the effectiveness of geometric depth. Direct prediction for the projected height unavoidably results in a loss of 2D priors, while multi-depth prediction with complex branches does not fully leverage geometric depth. This paper presents a Transformer-based monocular 3D object detection method called MonoDGP, which adopts perspective-invariant geometry errors to modify the projection formula. We also try to systematically discuss and explain the mechanisms and efficacy behind geometry errors, which serve as a simple but effective alternative to multi-depth prediction. Additionally, MonoDGP decouples the depth-guided decoder and constructs a 2D decoder only dependent on visual features, providing 2D priors and initializing object queries without the disturbance of 3D detection. To further optimize and fine-tune input tokens of the transformer decoder, we also introduce a Region Segment Head (RSH) that generates enhanced features and segment embeddings. Our monocular method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark without extra data. Code is available at https://github.com/PuFanqi23/MonoDGP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Zhao, Xuan Wang, Tong Zhang, Saqib Javed, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, 3DGS tends to overfit when trained with sparse views, limiting its generalization to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we address this overfitting issue by introducing Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS). We achieve self-ensembling by incorporating an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy during training. A $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model and a $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model are jointly trained on the available images. The $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model is dynamically perturbed based on rendering uncertainty across training steps, generating diverse perturbed models with negligible computational overhead. Discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and these perturbed models are minimized throughout training, forming a robust ensemble of 3DGS models. This ensemble, represented by the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model, is then used to generate novel-view images during inference. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances NVS quality under few-shot training conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: We investigate what kind of images lie in the high-density regions of diffusion models. We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-density sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilun Zhang, Haozhan Shen, Tiancheng Zhao, Yuhao Wang, Bin Chen, Yuxiang Cai, Yongheng Shang, Jianwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultra High Resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery (RSI) (e.g. 100,000 $\times$ 100,000 pixels or more) poses a significant challenge for current Remote Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models (RSMLLMs). If choose to resize the UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and contextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise, the original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard RSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range dependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this paper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the complexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle this task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage extensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis is both accurate and efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: TIPO (Text-to-Image Prompt Optimization) introduces an efficient approach for automatic prompt refinement in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Starting from simple user prompts, TIPO leverages a lightweight pre-trained model to expand these prompts into richer, detailed versions. Conceptually, TIPO samples refined prompts from a targeted sub-distribution within the broader semantic space, preserving the original intent while significantly improving visual quality, coherence, and detail. Unlike resource-intensive methods based on large language models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO provides computational efficiency and scalability, opening new possibilities for effective, automated prompt engineering in T2I tasks.
  We provide visual results, human preference report to investigate TIPO's effectiveness. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in aesthetic quality, significant reduction of visual artifacts, and enhanced alignment with target distributions along with significant human preference proficiency. These results highlight the importance of targeted prompt engineering in text-to-image tasks and indicate broader opportunities for automated prompt refinement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiguang Miao, Kang Liu, Zhuoqi Ma, Yunan Li, Xiaolu Kang, Ruixuan Liu, Tianyi Liu, Kun Xie, Zhicheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology reports are crucial for planning treatment strategies and facilitating effective doctor-patient communication. However, the manual creation of these reports places a significant burden on radiologists. While automatic radiology report generation presents a promising solution, existing methods often rely on single-view radiographs, which constrain diagnostic accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{EVOKE}, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that incorporates multi-view contrastive learning and patient-specific knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a multi-view contrastive learning method that enhances visual representation by aligning multi-view radiographs with their corresponding report. After that, we present a knowledge-guided report generation module that integrates available patient-specific indications (e.g., symptom descriptions) to trigger the production of accurate and coherent radiology reports. To support research in multi-view report generation, we construct Multi-view CXR and Two-view CXR datasets using publicly available sources. Our proposed EVOKE surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 2.9\% F\textsubscript{1} RadGraph improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 7.3\% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN, a 3.1\% BLEU-4 improvement on Multi-view CXR, and an 8.2\% F\textsubscript{1,mic-14} CheXbert improvement on Two-view CXR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ola Shorinwa, Jiankai Sun, Mac Schwager</p>
<p>Abstract: We present FAST-Splat for fast, ambiguity-free semantic Gaussian Splatting, which seeks to address the main limitations of existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods, namely: slow training and rendering speeds; high memory usage; and ambiguous semantic object localization. We take a bottom-up approach in deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic distillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation. Ultimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting. Precisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with unambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train, achieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods. Further, FAST-Splat achieves relatively similar or better semantic segmentation performance compared to existing methods. After the review period, we will provide links to the project website and the codebase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Koleilat, Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated substantial success in self-supervised representation learning for vision tasks. However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

<p>Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolai Hermann, Jorge Condor, Piotr Didyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval is a critical task for managing diverse visual content, but common benchmarks for the task rely on small, single-domain datasets that fail to capture real-world complexity. Pre-trained vision-language models tend to perform well with easy negatives but struggle with hard negatives--visually similar yet incorrect images--especially in open-domain scenarios. To address this, we introduce Episodic Few-Shot Adaptation (EFSA), a novel test-time framework that adapts pre-trained models dynamically to a query's domain by fine-tuning on top-k retrieved candidates and synthetic captions generated for them. EFSA improves performance across diverse domains while preserving generalization, as shown in evaluations on queries from eight highly distinct visual domains and an open-domain retrieval pool of over one million images. Our work highlights the potential of episodic few-shot adaptation to enhance robustness in the critical and understudied task of open-domain text-to-image retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human pose estimation methods work well on isolated people but struggle with multiple-bodies-in-proximity scenarios. Previous work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation by detected bounding boxes or keypoints, but overlooked instance masks. We propose to iteratively enforce mutual consistency of bounding boxes, instance masks, and poses. The introduced BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP) method uses three specialized models that improve each other's output in a closed loop. All models are adapted for mutual conditioning, which improves robustness in multi-body scenes. MaskPose, a new mask-conditioned pose estimation model, is the best among top-down approaches on OCHuman. BBox-Mask-Pose pushes SOTA on OCHuman dataset in all three tasks - detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation. It also achieves SOTA performance on COCO pose estimation. The method is especially good in scenes with large instances overlap, where it improves detection by 39% over the baseline detector. With small specialized models and faster runtime, BMP is an effective alternative to large human-centered foundational models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Blanca Lasheras-Hernandez, Klaus H. Strobl, Sergio Izquierdo, Tim Bodenm\"uller, Rudolph Triebel, Javier Civera</p>
<p>Abstract: Metric depth estimation from visual sensors is crucial for robots to perceive, navigate, and interact with their environment. Traditional range imaging setups, such as stereo or structured light cameras, face hassles including calibration, occlusions, and hardware demands, with accuracy limited by the baseline between cameras. Single- and multi-view monocular depth offers a more compact alternative, but is constrained by the unobservability of the metric scale. Light field imaging provides a promising solution for estimating metric depth by using a unique lens configuration through a single device. However, its application to single-view dense metric depth is under-addressed mainly due to the technology's high cost, the lack of public benchmarks, and proprietary geometrical models and software. Our work explores the potential of focused plenoptic cameras for dense metric depth. We propose a novel pipeline that predicts metric depth from a single plenoptic camera shot by first generating a sparse metric point cloud using machine learning, which is then used to scale and align a dense relative depth map regressed by a foundation depth model, resulting in dense metric depth. To validate it, we curated the Light Field & Stereo Image Dataset (LFS) of real-world light field images with stereo depth labels, filling a current gap in existing resources. Experimental results show that our pipeline produces accurate metric depth predictions, laying a solid groundwork for future research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quang H. Nguyen, Hoang Phan, Khoa D. Doan</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of both positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework, demonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoning Wu, Ziheng Zhao, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Training medical image segmentation models for rare yet clinically significant imaging modalities is challenging due to the scarcity of annotated data, and manual mask annotations can be costly and labor-intensive to acquire. This paper investigates leveraging generative models to synthesize training data, to train segmentation models for underrepresented modalities, particularly on annotation-scarce MRI. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising extensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes, regions, and organs information, with a subset having pixelwise mask annotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for controllable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and segmentation masks. MRGen can generate realistic images for diverse MRI modalities lacking mask annotations, facilitating segmentation training in low-source domains; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that MRGen significantly improves segmentation performance on unannotated modalities by providing high-quality synthetic data. We believe that our method bridges a critical gap in medical image analysis, extending segmentation capabilities to scenarios that are challenging to acquire manual annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron Braunstein, Hevra Petekkaya, Jan Eric Lenssen, Mariya Toneva, Eddy Ilg</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SLayR, Scene Layout Generation with Rectified flow, a novel transformer-based model for text-to-layout generation which can then be paired with existing layout-to-image models to produce images. SLayR addresses a domain in which current text-to-image pipelines struggle: generating scene layouts that are of significant variety and plausibility, when the given prompt is ambiguous and does not provide constraints on the scene. SLayR surpasses existing baselines including LLMs in unconstrained generation, and can generate layouts from an open caption set. To accurately evaluate the layout generation, we introduce a new benchmark suite, including numerical metrics and a carefully designed repeatable human-evaluation procedure that assesses the plausibility and variety of generated images. We show that our method sets a new state of the art for achieving both at the same time, while being at least 3x times smaller in the number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Yuli Tian, Yonghui Wang, Yong Liao, Lin Wang, Yuyang Wang, Peng Yuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Distilling 3D representations from pretrained 2D diffusion models is essential for 3D creative applications across gaming, film, and interior design. Current SDS-based methods are hindered by inefficient information distillation from diffusion models, which prevents the creation of photorealistic 3D contents. In this paper, we first reevaluate the SDS approach by analyzing its fundamental nature as a basic image editing process that commonly results in over-saturation, over-smoothing, lack of rich content and diversity due to the poor-quality single-step denoising. In light of this, we then propose a novel method called 3D Generation by Editing (GE3D). Each iteration of GE3D utilizes a 2D editing framework that combines a noising trajectory to preserve the information of the input image, alongside a text-guided denoising trajectory. We optimize the process by aligning the latents across both trajectories. This approach fully exploits pretrained diffusion models to distill multi-granularity information through multiple denoising steps, resulting in photorealistic 3D outputs. Both theoretical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, which not only advances 3D generation technology but also establishes a novel connection between 3D generation and 2D editing. This could potentially inspire further research in the field. Code and demos are released at https://jahnsonblack.github.io/GE3D/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paula Daud\'en-Oliver, David Agost-Beltran, Emilio Sansano-Sansano, Valero Laparra, Jes\'us Malo, Marina Mart\'inez-Garcia</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehao Chen, Rong Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are essential XML-based formats for versatile graphics, offering resolution independence and scalability. Unlike raster images, SVGs use geometric shapes and support interactivity, animation, and manipulation via CSS and JavaScript. Current SVG generation methods face challenges related to high computational costs and complexity. In contrast, human designers use component-based tools for efficient SVG creation. Inspired by this, SVGBuilder introduces a component-based, autoregressive model for generating high-quality colored SVGs from textual input. It significantly reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our model generates SVGs up to 604 times faster than optimization-based approaches. To address the limitations of existing SVG datasets and support our research, we introduce ColorSVG-100K, the first large-scale dataset of colored SVGs, comprising 100,000 graphics. This dataset fills the gap in color information for SVG generation models and enhances diversity in model training. Evaluation against state-of-the-art models demonstrates SVGBuilder's superior performance in practical applications, highlighting its efficiency and quality in generating complex SVG graphics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan-Sheng Zeng, Yunheng Li, Daquan Zhou, Guanbin Li, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary image segmentation has been advanced through the synergy between mask generators and vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Previous approaches focus on generating masks while aligning mask features with text embeddings during training. In this paper, we observe that relying on generated low-quality masks can weaken the alignment of vision and language in regional representations. This motivates us to present a new fine-tuning framework, named MaskCLIP++, which uses ground-truth masks instead of generated masks to enhance the mask classification capability of CLIP. Due to the limited diversity of image segmentation datasets with mask annotations, we propose incorporating a consistency alignment principle during fine-tuning, which alleviates categorical bias toward the fine-tuning dataset. After low-cost fine-tuning, MaskCLIP++ significantly improves the mask classification performance on multi-domain datasets. Combining with the mask generator in previous state-of-the-art mask-based open vocabulary segmentation methods, we achieve performance improvements of +1.7, +2.3, +2.1, +3.1, and +0.3 mIoU on the A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, and PAS-20 datasets, respectively.

<p>Abstract: We present TAR3D, a novel framework that consists of a 3D-aware Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) and a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to generate high-quality 3D assets. The core insight of this work is to migrate the multimodal unification and promising learning capabilities of the next-token prediction paradigm to conditional 3D object generation. To achieve this, the 3D VQ-VAE first encodes a wide range of 3D shapes into a compact triplane latent space and utilizes a set of discrete representations from a trainable codebook to reconstruct fine-grained geometries under the supervision of query point occupancy. Then, the 3D GPT, equipped with a custom triplane position embedding called TriPE, predicts the codebook index sequence with prefilling prompt tokens in an autoregressive manner so that the composition of 3D geometries can be modeled part by part. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet and Objaverse demonstrate that TAR3D can achieve superior generation quality over existing methods in text-to-3D and image-to-3D tasks</p>

<p>Abstract: In the domain of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieving human-centric video understanding remains a formidable challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize object and action recognition, often neglecting the intricate nuances of human emotions, behaviors, and speech-visual alignment within video content. We present HumanVBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to bridge these gaps in the evaluation of video MLLMs. HumanVBench comprises 16 carefully designed tasks that explore two primary dimensions: inner emotion and outer manifestations, spanning static and dynamic, basic and complex, as well as single-modal and cross-modal aspects. With two advanced automated pipelines for video annotation and distractor-included QA generation, HumanVBench utilizes diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to streamline benchmark data synthesis and quality assessment, minimizing human annotation dependency tailored to human-centric multimodal attributes. A comprehensive evaluation across 22 SOTA video MLLMs reveals notable limitations in current performance, especially in cross-modal and emotion perception, underscoring the necessity for further refinement toward achieving more human-like understanding. HumanVBench is open-sourced to facilitate future advancements and real-world applications in video MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, dataset condensation has made significant progress in the image domain. Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) the evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation algorithms to the space-time domain. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) labeling methods greatly influence condensation performance, (ii) simple sliding-window sampling is effective for temporal processing, and (iii) dataset distillation methods perform better in challenging scenarios, while sample selection methods excel in easier ones. Furthermore, we propose a unified evaluation protocol for the fair comparison of different condensation algorithms and achieve state-of-the-art results on four widely-used action recognition datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, SSv2 and K400.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Li, Jiacheng Zhang, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma, Guanbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in visual-language understanding for downstream multi-modal tasks. Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from generating hallucinations in complex generation tasks, leading to inconsistencies between visual inputs and generated content. To address this issue, some approaches have introduced inference-time interventions, such as contrastive decoding and attention rectification, to reduce overreliance on language priors. However, these approaches overlook hallucinations stemming from spurious inter-modality correlations. In this paper, we propose an Inter-Modality Correlation Calibration Decoding (IMCCD) method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs in a training-free manner. In this method, we design a Cross-Modal Value-Enhanced Decoding(CMVED) module to alleviate hallucination by a novel contrastive decoding mechanism. During the estimation of distorted distribution, CMVED masks the value vectors associated with significant cross-modal attention weights, which address both uni-modality overreliance and misleading inter-modality correlations. Additionally, a Content-Driven Attention Refinement(CDAR) module refines cross-modal attention weights, guiding LVLMs to focus on important visual content. Experimental results on diverse hallucination benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art techniques in reducing hallucinations in LVLM text generation.

<p>Abstract: We present LocoGS, a locality-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that exploits the spatial coherence of 3D Gaussians for compact modeling of volumetric scenes. To this end, we first analyze the local coherence of 3D Gaussian attributes, and propose a novel locality-aware 3D Gaussian representation that effectively encodes locally-coherent Gaussian attributes using a neural field representation with a minimal storage requirement. On top of the novel representation, LocoGS is carefully designed with additional components such as dense initialization, an adaptive spherical harmonics bandwidth scheme and different encoding schemes for different Gaussian attributes to maximize compression performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\times$ to 96.6$\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\times$ to 2.4$\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS. Even our approach also demonstrates an averaged 2.4$\times$ higher rendering speed than the state-of-the-art compression method with comparable compression performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oikantik Nath, Hanani Bathina, Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan, Mitesh M. Khapra</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened new possibilities in automatic grading of handwritten student responses, particularly in mathematics. However, a comprehensive study to test the ability of VLMs to evaluate and reason over handwritten content remains absent. To address this gap, we introduce FERMAT, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of VLMs to detect, localize and correct errors in handwritten mathematical content. FERMAT spans four key error dimensions - computational, conceptual, notational, and presentation - and comprises over 2,200 handwritten math solutions derived from 609 manually curated problems from grades 7-12 with intentionally introduced perturbations. Using FERMAT we benchmark nine VLMs across three tasks: error detection, localization, and correction. Our results reveal significant shortcomings in current VLMs in reasoning over handwritten text, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest error correction rate (77%). We also observed that some models struggle with processing handwritten content, as their accuracy improves when handwritten inputs are replaced with printed text or images. These findings highlight the limitations of current VLMs and reveal new avenues for improvement. We release FERMAT and all the associated resources in the open-source to drive further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonwoo Kim, Sangwon Beak, Hanbyul Joo</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling how humans interact with objects is crucial for AI to effectively assist or mimic human behaviors. Existing studies for learning such ability primarily focus on static human-object interaction (HOI) patterns, such as contact and spatial relationships, while dynamic HOI patterns, capturing the movement of humans and objects over time, remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning Dynamic Affordance across various target object categories. To address the scarcity of 4D HOI datasets, our method learns the 3D dynamic affordance from synthetically generated 4D HOI samples. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates 2D HOI videos from a given 3D target object using a pre-trained video diffusion model, then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOI samples. Leveraging these synthesized 4D HOI samples, we train DAViD, our generative 4D human-object interaction model, which is composed of two key components: (1) a human motion diffusion model (MDM) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to fine-tune a pre-trained MDM to learn the HOI motion concepts from limited HOI motion samples, (2) a motion diffusion model for 4D object poses conditioned by produced human interaction motions. Interestingly, DAViD can integrate newly learned HOI motion concepts with pre-trained human motions to create novel HOI motions, even for multiple HOI motion concepts, demonstrating the advantage of our pipeline with LoRA in integrating dynamic HOI concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAViD outperforms baselines in synthesizing HOI motion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Zhang, Cheng Yan, Yang Liu, Chenchen Jing, Lei Zhou, Wenjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions by leveraging knowledge from seen compositions. Existing methods align textual prototypes with visual features through Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but they face two key limitations: (1) modality gaps hinder the discrimination of semantically similar composition pairs, and (2) single-modal textual prototypes lack fine-grained visual cues, creating bottlenecks in VLM-based CZSL. In this paper, we introduce Visual Proxy Learning, a novel approach that facilitates the learning of distinct visual distributions, effectively reducing the modality gap and improving compositional generalization performance. Specifically, we initialize visual proxies for various attributes, objects, and their compositions using text representations. By optimizing the visual space, we capture fine-grained visual cues and guide the learning of more discriminative visual representations for attributes, objects and compositions. Furthermore, we propose an effective Cross-Modal Joint Learning (CMJL) strategy that imposes cross-modal constraints between the original text-image space and the fine-grained visual space. This approach not only boosts generalization for previously unseen composition pairs but also sharpens the discrimination of similar pairs, fostering more robust and precise learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in closed-world scenarios and competitive open-world results across four established CZSL benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our approach in advancing compositional generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have become essential for autonomous driving by enabling future scene prediction. However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model, enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive studies on nuScenes and OmniDrive-nuScenes datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing generation error by 32.4% and improving understanding metrics such as CIDEr by 8.0%.

<p>Abstract: Human motion generation and editing are key components of computer graphics and vision. However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding} to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

We devise semantic-aware Gaussians as intermediate geometric descriptors and propose a cumulative Gaussian-to-voxel splatting algorithm that enables effective and efficient occupancy annotation. Our framework outperforms existing automated occupancy annotation methods without human labels. AutoOcc also enables open-ended semantic occupancy auto-labeling, achieving robust performance in both static and dynamically complex scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have spurred the development of video editing techniques, which can be divided into inversion-based and end-to-end methods. However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita-2m-dataset.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liying Yang, Chen Liu, Zhenwei Zhu, Ajian Liu, Hui Ma, Jian Nong, Yanyan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a video has shown impressive results. Existing methods directly optimize Gaussians using whole information in frames. However, when dynamic regions are interwoven with static regions within frames, particularly if the static regions account for a large proportion, existing methods often overlook information in dynamic regions and are prone to overfitting on static regions. This leads to producing results with blurry textures. We consider that decoupling dynamic-static features to enhance dynamic representations can alleviate this issue. Thus, we propose a dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD). Along temporal axes, it regards the regions of current frame features that possess significant differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features. Conversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire decoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features. Moreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features from different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF). Along spatial axes, it adaptively selects similar information of dynamic regions. Hinging on the above, we construct a novel approach, DS4D. Experimental results verify our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video-to-4D. In addition, the experiments on a real-world scenario dataset demonstrate its effectiveness on the 4D scene. Our code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Zhou, Jiazi Bu, Pengyang Ling, Pan Zhang, Tong Wu, Qidong Huang, Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuhang Cao, Anyi Rao, Jiaqi Wang, Li Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers of the image relight model to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the relighted image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Dodds, Tara Boroushaki, Cusuh Ham, Fadel Adib</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to observe the world is fundamental to reasoning and making informed decisions on how to interact with the environment. However, optical perception can often be disrupted due to common occurrences, such as occlusions, which can pose challenges to existing vision systems. We present MITO, the first millimeter-wave (mmWave) dataset of diverse, everyday objects, collected using a UR5 robotic arm with two mmWave radars operating at different frequencies and an RGB-D camera. Unlike visible light, mmWave signals can penetrate common occlusions (e.g., cardboard boxes, fabric, plastic) but each mmWave frame has much lower resolution than typical cameras. To capture higher-resolution mmWave images, we leverage the robot's mobility and fuse frames over the synthesized aperture. MITO captures over 24 million mmWave frames and uses them to generate 550 high-resolution mmWave (synthetic aperture) images in line-of-sight and non-light-of-sight (NLOS), as well as RGB-D images, segmentation masks, and raw mmWave signals, taken from 76 different objects. We develop an open-source simulation tool that can be used to generate synthetic mmWave images for any 3D triangle mesh. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our dataset and simulator for enabling broader NLOS perception by developing benchmarks for NLOS segmentation and classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Fuest, Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\"orn Ommer</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating long, high-quality videos remains a challenge due to the complex interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics and hardware limitations. In this work, we introduce MaskFlow, a unified video generation framework that combines discrete representations with flow-matching to enable efficient generation of high-quality long videos. By leveraging a frame-level masking strategy during training, MaskFlow conditions on previously generated unmasked frames to generate videos with lengths ten times beyond that of the training sequences. MaskFlow does so very efficiently by enabling the use of fast Masked Generative Model (MGM)-style sampling and can be deployed in both fully autoregressive as well as full-sequence generation modes. We validate the quality of our method on the FaceForensics (FFS) and Deepmind Lab (DMLab) datasets and report Frechet Video Distance (FVD) competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a detailed analysis on the sampling efficiency of our method and demonstrate that MaskFlow can be applied to both timestep-dependent and timestep-independent models in a training-free manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaomiao Cai, Guanjie Wang, Wei Li, Zhijun Tu, Hanting Chen, Shaohui Lin, Jie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In autoregressive (AR) image generation, models based on the 'next-token prediction' paradigm of LLMs have shown comparable performance to diffusion models by reducing inductive biases. However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the image's structure and details, impacting the generation's accuracy and stability. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Prompt engineering, as a key technique for guiding LLMs, leverages specifically designed prompts to improve model performance on complex natural language processing (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation while maintaining contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by prompt engineering from the field of NLP, we propose Vision Full-view prompt (VF prompt) to enhance autoregressive image generation. Specifically, we design specialized image-related VF prompts for AR image generation to simulate the process of human image creation. This enhances contextual logic ability by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without VF prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongbo Shi, Shen Cao, Lubin Fan, Bojian Wu, Jinhui Guo, Renjie Chen, Ligang Liu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced ability on novel view synthesis, it still depends on accurate pre-computaed camera parameters, which are hard to obtain and prone to noise. Previous COLMAP-Free methods optimize camera poses using local constraints, but they often struggle in complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce TrackGS, which incorporates feature tracks to globally constrain multi-view geometry. We select the Gaussians associated with each track, which will be trained and rescaled to an infinitesimally small size to guarantee the spatial accuracy. We also propose minimizing both reprojection and backprojection errors for better geometric consistency. Moreover, by deriving the gradient of intrinsics, we unify camera parameter estimation with 3DGS training into a joint optimization framework, achieving SOTA performance on challenging datasets with severe camera movements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyan Qu, Gaopeng Gou, Jiamin Zhuang, Jing Yu, Kun Song, Qihao Wang, Yili Li, Gang Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in image classification by training with large-scale paired image-text data. Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting. In a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms existing textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description methods across 13 datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our optimal prompts improve adapter-based methods and transfer effectively across different backbones.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19962">ReCon: Enhancing True Correspondence Discrimination through Relation Consistency for Robust Noisy Correspondence Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanxing Zha, Xin Liu, Shu-Juan Peng, Yiu-ming Cheung, Xing Xu, Nannan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we accurately identify the true correspondences from multimodal datasets containing mismatched data pairs? Existing methods primarily emphasize the similarity matching between the representations of objects across modalities, potentially neglecting the crucial relation consistency within modalities that are particularly important for distinguishing the true and false correspondences. Such an omission often runs the risk of misidentifying negatives as positives, thus leading to unanticipated performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose a general Relation Consistency learning framework, namely ReCon, to accurately discriminate the true correspondences among the multimodal data and thus effectively mitigate the adverse impact caused by mismatches. Specifically, ReCon leverages a novel relation consistency learning to ensure the dual-alignment, respectively of, the cross-modal relation consistency between different modalities and the intra-modal relation consistency within modalities. Thanks to such dual constrains on relations, ReCon significantly enhances its effectiveness for true correspondence discrimination and therefore reliably filters out the mismatched pairs to mitigate the risks of wrong supervisions. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ReCon compared with other SOTAs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yancheng Cai, Fei Yin, Dounia Hammou, Rafal Mantiuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision foundation models, such as DINO or OpenCLIP, are trained in a self-supervised manner on large image datasets. Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p>

<p>Abstract: It remains a significant challenge to compress images at ultra-low bitrate while achieving both semantic consistency and high perceptual quality. We propose a novel image compression framework, Semantically Disentangled Image Compression (SEDIC) in this paper. Our proposed SEDIC leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) to disentangle the image into several essential semantic information, including an extremely compressed reference image, overall and object-level text descriptions, and the semantic masks. A multi-stage semantic decoder is designed to progressively restore the transmitted reference image object-by-object, ultimately producing high-quality and perceptually consistent reconstructions. In each decoding stage, a pre-trained controllable diffusion model is utilized to restore the object details on the reference image conditioned by the text descriptions and semantic masks. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at ultra-low bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have shown remarkable success in representing 3D scenes and generating high-quality, novel views in real-time. However, 3D-GS and its variants assume that input images are captured based on pinhole imaging and are fully in focus. This assumption limits their applicability, as real-world images often feature shallow depth-of-field (DoF). In this paper, we introduce DoF-Gaussian, a controllable depth-of-field method for 3D-GS. We develop a lens-based imaging model based on geometric optics principles to control DoF effects. To ensure accurate scene geometry, we incorporate depth priors adjusted per scene, and we apply defocus-to-focus adaptation to minimize the gap in the circle of confusion. We also introduce a synthetic dataset to assess refocusing capabilities and the model's ability to learn precise lens parameters. Our framework is customizable and supports various interactive applications. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.

<p>Abstract: Forecasting surgical instrument trajectories and predicting the next surgical action recently started to attract attention from the research community. Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyi Du, Xinzhe Luo, Declan P. O'Regan, Chen Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal image-tabular learning is gaining attention, yet it faces challenges due to limited labeled data. While earlier work has applied self-supervised learning (SSL) to unlabeled data, its task-agnostic nature often results in learning suboptimal features for downstream tasks. Semi-supervised learning (SemiSL), which combines labeled and unlabeled data, offers a promising solution. However, existing multimodal SemiSL methods typically focus on unimodal or modality-shared features, ignoring valuable task-relevant modality-specific information, leading to a Modality Information Gap. In this paper, we propose STiL, a novel SemiSL tabular-image framework that addresses this gap by comprehensively exploring task-relevant information. STiL features a new disentangled contrastive consistency module to learn cross-modal invariant representations of shared information while retaining modality-specific information via disentanglement. We also propose a novel consensus-guided pseudo-labeling strategy to generate reliable pseudo-labels based on classifier consensus, along with a new prototype-guided label smoothing technique to refine pseudo-label quality with prototype embeddings, thereby enhancing task-relevant information learning in unlabeled data. Experiments on natural and medical image datasets show that STiL outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised/SSL/SemiSL image/multimodal approaches.

<p>Abstract: Chinese calligraphy, a UNESCO Heritage, remains computationally challenging due to visual ambiguity and cultural complexity. Existing AI systems fail to contextualize their intricate scripts, because of limited annotated data and poor visual-semantic alignment. We propose CalliReader, a vision-language model (VLM) that solves the Chinese Calligraphy Contextualization (CC$^2$) problem through three innovations: (1) character-wise slicing for precise character extraction and sorting, (2) CalliAlign for visual-text token compression and alignment, (3) embedding instruction tuning (e-IT) for improving alignment and addressing data scarcity. We also build CalliBench, the first benchmark for full-page calligraphic contextualization, addressing three critical issues in previous OCR and VQA approaches: fragmented context, shallow reasoning, and hallucination. Extensive experiments including user studies have been conducted to verify our CalliReader's \textbf{superiority to other state-of-the-art methods and even human professionals in page-level calligraphy recognition and interpretation}, achieving higher accuracy while reducing hallucination. Comparisons with reasoning models highlight the importance of accurate recognition as a prerequisite for reliable comprehension. Quantitative analyses validate CalliReader's efficiency; evaluations on document and real-world benchmarks confirm its robust generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Luo, Tianyang Hu, Yifan Song, Jiacheng Sun, Zhenguo Li, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion distillation has enabled one-step generation through methods like Variational Score Distillation, adapting distilled models to emerging new controls -- such as novel structural constraints or latest user preferences -- remains challenging. Conventional approaches typically requires modifying the base diffusion model and redistilling it -- a process that is both computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Distribution Matching (JDM), a novel approach that minimizes the reverse KL divergence between image-condition joint distributions. By deriving a tractable upper bound, JDM decouples fidelity learning from condition learning. This asymmetric distillation scheme enables our one-step student to handle controls unknown to the teacher model and facilitates improved classifier-free guidance (CFG) usage and seamless integration of human feedback learning (HFL). Experimental results demonstrate that JDM surpasses baseline methods such as multi-step ControlNet by mere one-step in most cases, while achieving state-of-the-art performance in one-step text-to-image synthesis through improved usage of CFG or HFL integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Luo, Tianyang Hu, Jiacheng Sun, Yujun Cai, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65. Project page: https://tdm-t2x.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Wu, Liu Liu, Zhou Linli, Anran Huang, Liangtu Song, Qiaojun Yu, Qi Wu, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Articulated objects, as prevalent entities in human life, their 3D representations play crucial roles across various applications. However, achieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic generation for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling high-quality textured surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states. Codes will be released within the next four months and the project website is at https://sites.google.com/view/reartgs/home.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Zhang, Yiran Wang, Wei Mao, Danning Li, Rui Zhao, Biao Wu, Zirui Song, Bohan Zhuang, Ian Reid, Richard Hartley</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional motion generation has been extensively studied in computer vision, yet two critical challenges remain. First, while masked autoregressive methods have recently outperformed diffusion-based approaches, existing masking models lack a mechanism to prioritize dynamic frames and body parts based on given conditions. Second, existing methods for different conditioning modalities often fail to integrate multiple modalities effectively, limiting control and coherence in generated motion. To address these challenges, we propose Motion Anything, a multimodal motion generation framework that introduces an Attention-based Mask Modeling approach, enabling fine-grained spatial and temporal control over key frames and actions. Our model adaptively encodes multimodal conditions, including text and music, improving controllability. Additionally, we introduce Text-Music-Dance (TMD), a new motion dataset consisting of 2,153 pairs of text, music, and dance, making it twice the size of AIST++, thereby filling a critical gap in the community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Anything surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving a 15% improvement in FID on HumanML3D and showing consistent performance gains on AIST++ and TMD.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07033">Learning a Unified Degradation-aware Representation Model for Multi-modal Image Fusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolong Ma, Hui Li, Chunyang Cheng, Zeyang Zhang, Xiaoning Song, Xiao-Jun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: All-in-One Degradation-Aware Fusion Models (ADFMs), a class of multi-modal image fusion models, address complex scenes by mitigating degradations from source images and generating high-quality fused images. Mainstream ADFMs often rely on highly synthetic multi-modal multi-quality images for supervision, limiting their effectiveness in cross-modal and rare degradation scenarios. The inherent relationship among these multi-modal, multi-quality images of the same scene provides explicit supervision for training, but also raises above problems. To address these limitations, we present LURE, a Learning-driven Unified Representation model for infrared and visible Image Fusion, which is degradation-aware. LURE decouples multi-modal multi-quality data at the data level and recouples this relationship in a unified latent feature space (ULFS) by proposing a novel unified loss. This decoupling circumvents data-level limitations of prior models and allows leveraging real-world restoration datasets for training high-quality degradation-aware models, sidestepping above issues. To enhance text-image interaction, we refine image-text interaction and residual structures via Text-Guided Attention (TGA) and an inner residual structure. These enhances text's spatial perception of images and preserve more visual details. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across general fusion, degradation-aware fusion, and downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang, Sen Yang, Xiao Tan, Hanli Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As an essential component of autonomous driving systems, high-definition (HD) maps provide rich and precise environmental information for auto-driving scenarios; however, existing methods, which primarily rely on query-based detection frameworks to directly model map elements or implicitly propagate queries over time, often struggle to maintain consistent temporal perception outcomes. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of real-world autonomous driving and map data collection systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end tracking framework for global map construction by temporally tracking map elements' historical trajectories. Firstly, instance-level historical rasterization map representation is designed to explicitly store previous perception results, which can control and maintain different global instances' history information in a fine-grained way. Secondly, we introduce a Map-Trajectory Prior Fusion module within this tracking framework, leveraging historical priors for tracked instances to improve temporal smoothness and continuity. Thirdly, we propose a global perspective metric to evaluate the quality of temporal geometry construction in HD maps, filling the gap in current metrics for assessing global geometric perception results. Substantial experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both single-frame and temporal metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mona Sheikh Zeinoddin, Mobarakol Islam, Zafer Tandogdu, Greg Shaw, Mathew J. Clarkson, Evangelos Mazomenos, Danail Stoyanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate depth and camera pose estimation is essential for achieving high-quality 3D visualisations in robotic-assisted surgery. Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Motion Personalization, a new task that generates personalized motions aligned with text descriptions using several basic motions containing Persona. To support this novel task, we introduce a new large-scale motion dataset called PerMo (PersonaMotion), which captures the unique personas of multiple actors. We also propose a multi-modal finetuning method of a pretrained motion diffusion model called PersonaBooth. PersonaBooth addresses two main challenges: i) A significant distribution gap between the persona-focused PerMo dataset and the pretraining datasets, which lack persona-specific data, and ii) the difficulty of capturing a consistent persona from the motions vary in content (action type). To tackle the dataset distribution gap, we introduce a persona token to accept new persona features and perform multi-modal adaptation for both text and visuals during finetuning. To capture a consistent persona, we incorporate a contrastive learning technique to enhance intra-cohesion among samples with the same persona. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware fusion mechanism to maximize the integration of persona cues from multiple input motions. PersonaBooth outperforms state-of-the-art motion style transfer methods, establishing a new benchmark for motion personalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, and 2D Gaussian representation, an adaptation of 3D Gaussian Splatting for image representation, offer distinct approaches to modeling visual data. We present EigenGS, a novel method that bridges these paradigms through an efficient transformation pipeline connecting eigenspace and image-space Gaussian representations. Our approach enables instant initialization of Gaussian parameters for new images without requiring per-image optimization from scratch, dramatically accelerating convergence. EigenGS introduces a frequency-aware learning mechanism that encourages Gaussians to adapt to different scales, effectively modeling varied spatial frequencies and preventing artifacts in high-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EigenGS not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to direct 2D Gaussian fitting but also reduces necessary parameter count and training time. The results highlight EigenGS's effectiveness and generalization ability across images with varying resolutions and diverse categories, making Gaussian-based image representation both high-quality and viable for real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Nair, Bhanu Tokas, Neel Shah, Hannah Kerner</p>
<p>Abstract: When we train models on biased ML datasets, they not only learn these biases but can inflate them at test time - a phenomenon called bias amplification. To measure bias amplification in ML datasets, many co-occurrence-based metrics have been proposed. Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias amplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these metrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they cannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in captions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in Captioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it has limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified, poorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy, and is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in predictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional Predictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional bias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias using an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker models. Our experiments on the COCO captioning dataset show how DPAC is the most reliable metric to measure bias amplification in captions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wu, Xibin Song, Senbo Wang, Weizhe Liu, Jiayu Yang, Ziang Cheng, Shenzhou Chen, Taizhang Shang, Weixuan Sun, Shan Luo, Pan Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object reconstruction from single-view image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Recent advancements in Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) have shown great promise in leveraging multi-view images generated by 2D diffusion models to extract 3D content. However, challenges remain as 2D diffusion models often struggle to produce dense images with strong multi-view consistency, and LRMs tend to amplify these inconsistencies during the 3D reconstruction process. Addressing these issues is critical for achieving high-quality and efficient 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present CDI3D, a feed-forward framework designed for efficient, high-quality image-to-3D generation with view interpolation. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose to integrate 2D diffusion-based view interpolation into the LRM pipeline to enhance the quality and consistency of the generated mesh. Specifically, our approach introduces a Dense View Interpolation (DVI) module, which synthesizes interpolated images between main views generated by the 2D diffusion model, effectively densifying the input views with better multi-view consistency. We also design a tilt camera pose trajectory to capture views with different elevations and perspectives. Subsequently, we employ a tri-plane-based mesh reconstruction strategy to extract robust tokens from these interpolated and original views, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with superior texture and geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmarks, producing 3D content with enhanced texture fidelity and geometric accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhen Xu, Xiuxiu Bai, Xiaojun Jia, Jianwu Fang, Shanmin Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Query-based methods with dense features have demonstrated remarkable success in 3D object detection tasks. However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Li, Zongfang Liu, Xinhua Li, Jinghui Zhang, Pengwei Wang, Hu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to leveraging human language for enhancing downstream tasks. However, VLMs such as CLIP face significant limitation: its performance is highly sensitive to prompt template design. Although prompt learning methods can address the sensitivity issue by replacing natural language prompts with learnable ones, they are incomprehensible to humans. Ensuring consistent performance across various prompt templates enables models to adapt seamlessly to diverse phrasings, enhancing their ability to handle downstream tasks without requiring extensive prompt engineering. In this work, we introduce the RobustPrompt Benchmark, a systematic benchmark to evaluate robustness to different prompt templates for VLMs. It includes a dataset with hundreds of carefully designed prompt templates, divided into six types, covering a wide variety of commonly used templates. Beside the benchmark, we propose Modeling Variants of Prompts (MVP), a simple yet effective method that mitigates sensitivity by modeling variants of prompt structures. The innovation of MVP lies in decoupling prompts into templates and class names, and using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to model the distribution of diverse prompt structures. Experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that MVP can greatly enhance model robustness to variations in input prompts without a drop in performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjun Tu, Peng Ye, Dongzhan Zhou, Lei Bai, Gang Yu, Tao Chen, Wanli Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand out in various tasks but still struggle with hallucinations. While recent training-free mitigation methods mostly introduce additional inference overhead via retrospection strategy and contrastive decoding, we propose attention reallocation (AttnReal) to mitigate hallucinations with nearly zero extra cost. Our approach is motivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention distribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which further contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap between different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles excessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens, which reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding process depends more on the visual inputs. More interestingly, we find that, by controlling the intensity of AttnReal, we can achieve a wide-range trade-off between the response faithfulness and overall performance. Comprehensive results from different benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AttnReal across six open-source MLLMs and three decoding strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsong Xie, Zhao Zhang, Zhe Huang, Yanhao Zhang, Haonan Lu, Zhenyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling, particularly when paired with autoregressive models. However, current methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and fidelity: high-resolution image reconstruction either requires an excessive number of tokens or compromises critical details through token reduction. To resolve this, we propose Latent Consistency Tokenizer (Layton) that bridges discrete visual tokens with the compact latent space of pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling efficient representation of 1024x1024 images using only 256 tokens-a 16 times compression over VQGAN. Layton integrates a transformer encoder, a quantized codebook, and a latent consistency decoder. Direct application of LDM as the decoder results in color and brightness discrepancies. Thus, we convert it to latent consistency decoder, reducing multi-step sampling to 1-2 steps for direct pixel-level supervision. Experiments demonstrate Layton's superiority in high-fidelity reconstruction, with 10.8 reconstruction Frechet Inception Distance on MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark for 1024x1024 image reconstruction. We also extend Layton to a text-to-image generation model, LaytonGen, working in autoregression. It achieves 0.73 score on GenEval benchmark, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangping Wen, Jinyu Wen, Meie Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bag-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches have emerged as the mainstream methodology for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them.
  Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai, Yan Pan, Kun Yue, Jian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion-based test-time adaptations (TTA) have shown great advances, which leverage a diffusion model to map the images in the unknown test domain to the training domain. The unseen and diverse test domains make diffusion-based TTA an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we unravel two simple principles of the design tricks for diffusion-based methods. Intuitively, \textit{Principle 1} says semantic similarity preserving. We should preserve the semantic similarity between the original and generated test images. \textit{Principle 2} suggests minimal modifications. This principle enables the diffusion to map the test images to the training domain with minimal modifications of the test images. In particular, following the two principles, we propose our simple yet effective principle-guided diffusion-based test-time adaptation method (PDDA). Concretely, following Principle 1, we propose a semantic keeper, the method to preserve feature similarity, where the semantic keeper could filter the corruption introduced from the test domain, thus better preserving the semantics. Following Principle 2, we propose a modification keeper, where we introduce a regularization constraint into the generative process to minimize modifications to the test image. Meanwhile, there is a hidden conflict between the two principles. We further introduce the gradient-based view to unify the direction generated from two principles. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-W, and ImageNet-C with WideResNet-28-10, ResNet-50, Swin-T, and ConvNext-T demonstrate that PDDA significantly performs better than the complex state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, PDDA achieves 2.4\% average accuracy improvements in ImageNet-C without any training process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jos\'e Morano, Guilherme Aresta, Hrvoje Bogunovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: The caliber and configuration of retinal blood vessels serve as important biomarkers for various diseases and medical conditions. A thorough analysis of the retinal vasculature requires the segmentation of the blood vessels and their classification into arteries and veins, typically performed on color fundus images obtained by retinography. However, manually performing these tasks is labor-intensive and prone to human error. While several automated methods have been proposed to address this task, the current state of art faces challenges due to manifest classification errors affecting the topological consistency of segmentation maps. In this work, we introduce RRWNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that addresses this limitation. The framework consists of a fully convolutional neural network that recursively refines semantic segmentation maps, correcting manifest classification errors and thus improving topological consistency. In particular, RRWNet is composed of two specialized subnetworks: a Base subnetwork that generates base segmentation maps from the input images, and a Recursive Refinement subnetwork that iteratively and recursively improves these maps. Evaluation on three different public datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, yielding more topologically consistent segmentation maps with fewer manifest classification errors than existing approaches. In addition, the Recursive Refinement module within RRWNet proves effective in post-processing segmentation maps from other methods, further demonstrating its potential. The model code, weights, and predictions will be publicly available at https://github.com/j-morano/rrwnet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian B\"other, Abraham Sebastian, Pranjal Awasthi, Ana Klimovic, Srikumar Ramalingam</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern datasets span billions of samples, making training on all available data infeasible. Selecting a high quality subset helps in reducing training costs and enhancing model quality. Submodularity, a discrete analogue of convexity, is commonly used for solving such subset selection problems. However, existing algorithms for optimizing submodular functions are sequential, and the prior distributed methods require at least one central machine to fit the target subset in DRAM. At billion datapoint scale, even the subset may not fit a single machine, and the sequential algorithms are prohibitively slow. In this paper, we relax the requirement of having a central machine for the target subset by proposing a novel distributed bounding algorithm with provable approximation guarantees. The algorithm iteratively bounds the minimum and maximum utility values to select high quality points and discard the unimportant ones. When bounding does not find the complete subset, we use a multi-round, partition-based distributed greedy algorithm to identify the remaining subset. We discuss how to implement these algorithms in a distributed data processing framework and empirically analyze different configurations. We find high quality subsets on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with marginal or no loss in quality compared to centralized methods, and scale to a dataset with 13 billion points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Rahul Bhadani, Larry Head</p>
<p>Abstract: Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xichennn/V2I_trajectory_prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shouyue Liu, Ziyi Zhang, Yuanyuan Gu, Jinkui Hao, Yonghuai Liu, Huazhu Fu, Xinyu Guo, Hong Song, Shuting Zhang, Yitian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module to excavate the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient point cloud coding has become increasingly critical for multiple applications such as virtual reality, autonomous driving, and digital twin systems, where rich and interactive 3D data representations may functionally make the difference. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering advanced techniques for compressing point clouds more efficiently than conventional coding methods while also allowing effective computer vision tasks performed in the compressed domain thus, for the first time, making available a common compressed visual representation effective for both man and machine. Taking advantage of this potential, JPEG has recently finalized the JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding (PCC) standard offering efficient lossy coding of static point clouds, targeting both human visualization and machine processing by leveraging deep learning models for geometry and color coding. The geometry is processed directly in its original 3D form using sparse convolutional neural networks, while the color data is projected onto 2D images and encoded using the also learning-based JPEG AI standard. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete technical description of the JPEG PCC standard, along with a thorough benchmarking of its performance against the state-of-the-art, while highlighting its main strengths and weaknesses. In terms of compression performance, JPEG PCC outperforms the conventional MPEG PCC standards, especially in geometry coding, achieving significant rate reductions. Color compression performance is less competitive but this is overcome by the power of a full learning-based coding framework for both geometry and color and the associated effective compressed domain processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Qiu, Yutian Chen, Zihao Zhang, Wenshan Wang, Sebastian Scherer</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the MAC-VO, a novel learning-based stereo VO that leverages the learned metrics-aware matching uncertainty for dual purposes: selecting keypoint and weighing the residual in pose graph optimization. Compared to traditional geometric methods prioritizing texture-affluent features like edges, our keypoint selector employs the learned uncertainty to filter out the low-quality features based on global inconsistency. In contrast to the learning-based algorithms that model the scale-agnostic diagonal weight matrix for covariance, we design a metrics-aware covariance model to capture the spatial error during keypoint registration and the correlations between different axes. Integrating this covariance model into pose graph optimization enhances the robustness and reliability of pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments with varying illumination, feature density, and motion patterns. On public benchmark datasets, MAC-VO outperforms existing VO algorithms and even some SLAM algorithms in challenging environments. The covariance map also provides valuable information about the reliability of the estimated poses, which can benefit decision-making for autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Luo, Yilun Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Large video models, pretrained on massive amounts of Internet video, provide a rich source of physical knowledge about the dynamics and motions of objects and tasks. However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation. We show how our approach is on par with or even surpasses multiple behavior cloning baselines trained on expert demonstrations while without requiring any action annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinqi Xiao, Shen Sang, Tiancheng Zhi, Jing Liu, Qing Yan, Yuqian Zhang, Linjie Luo, Bo Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large-scale neural networks in vision, and multimodal domains demands substantial memory resources, primarily due to the storage of optimizer states. While LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient method, reduces memory usage, it often suffers from suboptimal performance due to the constraints of low-rank updates. Low-rank gradient projection methods (e.g., GaLore, Flora) reduce optimizer memory by projecting gradients and moment estimates into low-rank spaces via singular value decomposition or random projection. However, they fail to account for inter-projection correlation, causing performance degradation, and their projection strategies often incur high computational costs. In this paper, we present COAP (Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection), a memory-efficient method that minimizes computational overhead while maintaining training performance. Evaluated across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks, COAP outperforms existing methods in both training speed and model performance. For LLaMA-1B, it reduces optimizer memory by 61% with only 2% additional time cost, achieving the same PPL as AdamW. With 8-bit quantization, COAP cuts optimizer memory by 81% and achieves 4x speedup over GaLore for LLaVA-v1.5-7B fine-tuning, while delivering higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadab Ahamed, Eldad Haber</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse problems, which involve estimating parameters from incomplete or noisy observations, arise in various fields such as medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. These problems are often ill-posed, requiring regularization techniques to stabilize the solution. In this work, we employ Flow Matching (FM), a generative framework that integrates a deterministic processes to map a simple reference distribution, such as a Gaussian, to the target distribution. Our method DAWN-FM: Data-AWare and Noise-informed Flow Matching incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent velocity field, FM not only provides accurate solutions but also enables uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings, our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image deblurring and tomography.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Li, Kuangyu Ding, Kim-Chuan Toh, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Preconditioned stochastic optimization algorithms, exemplified by Shampoo, outperform first-order optimizers by offering theoretical convergence benefits and practical gains in large-scale neural network training. However, they incur substantial memory overhead due to the storage demands of non-diagonal preconditioning matrices. To address this, we introduce 4-bit quantization for Shampoo's preconditioners. We introduce two key methods: First, we apply Cholesky decomposition followed by quantization of the Cholesky factors, reducing memory usage by leveraging their lower triangular structure while better preserving spectral properties to minimize information loss. To our knowledge, this is the first quantization approach applied to Cholesky factors of preconditioners. Second, we incorporate error feedback in the quantization process, efficiently storing Cholesky factor and error state in the lower and upper triangular parts of the same matrix. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that combining Cholesky quantization with error feedback enhances memory efficiency and algorithm performance in large-scale deep-learning tasks. Theoretically, we also provide convergence proofs for quantized Shampoo under both smooth and non-smooth stochastic optimization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Shirkavand, Peiran Yu, Shangqian Gao, Gowthami Somepalli, Tom Goldstein, Heng Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion generative models have yielded remarkable progress. While the quality of generated content continues to improve, these models have grown considerably in size and complexity. This increasing computational burden poses significant challenges, particularly in resource-constrained deployment scenarios such as mobile devices. The combination of model pruning and knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational demands while preserving generation quality. However, this technique inadvertently propagates undesirable behaviors, including the generation of copyrighted content and unsafe concepts, even when such instances are absent from the fine-tuning dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for pruned diffusion models that consolidates the fine-tuning and unlearning processes into a unified phase. Our approach maintains the principal advantages of distillation-namely, efficient convergence and style transfer capabilities-while selectively suppressing the generation of unwanted content. This plug-in framework is compatible with various pruning and concept unlearning methods, facilitating efficient, safe deployment of diffusion models in controlled environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Du Chen, Liyi Chen, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is an essential tool in neuroimaging. It is arguably the sole noninvasive technique for examining the microstructural properties and structural connectivity of the brain. Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning and data-driven approaches that enhance the speed, accuracy, and consistency of dMRI data analysis. However, traditional deep learning models often fell short, as they typically utilize pixel-level or volumetric patch-level embeddings similar to those used in structural MRI, and do not account for the unique distribution of various gradient encodings. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool in clinical settings but its utility is often hindered by noise artifacts introduced during the imaging process. Effective denoising is critical for enhancing image quality while preserving anatomical structures. However traditional denoising methods which typically assume uniform noise distributions struggle to handle the non-uniform noise commonly present in MRI images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts framework for MRI image denoising. Each expert is a specialized denoising convolutional neural network fine-tuned to target specific noise characteristics associated with different image regions. Our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art denoising techniques on both synthetic and real-world MRI datasets. Furthermore we show that it generalizes effectively to unseen datasets highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Albert, Frederic Z. Zhang, Hemanth Saratchandran, Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. The low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashank Gupta, Chaitanya Ahuja, Tsung-Yu Lin, Sreya Dutta Roy, Harrie Oosterhuis, Maarten de Rijke, Satya Narayan Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for clinical diagnostics but is hindered by prolonged scan times. Current deep learning models enhance MRI reconstruction but are often memory-intensive and unsuitable for resource-limited systems. This paper introduces a lightweight MRI reconstruction model leveraging Kronecker-Parameterized Hypercomplex Neural Networks to achieve high performance with reduced parameters. By integrating Kronecker-based modules, including Kronecker MLP, Kronecker Window Attention, and Kronecker Convolution, the proposed model efficiently extracts spatial features while preserving representational power. We introduce Kronecker U-Net and Kronecker SwinMR, which maintain high reconstruction quality with approximately 50% fewer parameters compared to existing models. Experimental evaluation on the FastMRI dataset demonstrates competitive PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, even at high acceleration factors (8x and 16x), with no significant performance drop. Additionally, Kronecker variants exhibit superior generalization and reduced overfitting on limited datasets, facilitating efficient MRI reconstruction on hardware-constrained systems. This approach sets a new benchmark for parameter-efficient medical imaging models.</p>

However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjoon Jeong, Junha Chun, Soonwoo Cha, Taesup Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07085">RS2V-L: Vehicle-Mounted LiDAR Data Generation from Roadside Sensor Observations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruidan Xing, Runyi Huang, Qing Xu, Lei He</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving solutions, which process multi-modal sensory data to directly generate refined control commands, have become a dominant paradigm in autonomous driving research. However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2V-L, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the generated data into model training-complementing the KITTI dataset-enhances 3D object detection accuracy by over \text{30\%} while improving the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation by more than an order of magnitude. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08085">PRISM: Privacy-Preserving Improved Stochastic Masking for Federated Generative Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongkook Seo, Dong-Jun Han, Jaejun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL), the integration of generative models into FL has been limited due to challenges such as high communication costs and unstable training in heterogeneous data environments. To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled.</p>
