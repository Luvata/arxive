<p><b>Authors:</b> Weili Zeng, Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Yichao Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yide Di, Yun Liao, Hao Zhou, Kaijun Zhu, Qing Duan, Junhui Liu, Mingyu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image feature matching, a foundational task in computer vision, remains challenging for multimodal image applications, often necessitating intricate training on specific datasets. In this paper, we introduce a Unified Feature Matching pre-trained model (UFM) designed to address feature matching challenges across a wide spectrum of modal images. We present Multimodal Image Assistant (MIA) transformers, finely tunable structures adept at handling diverse feature matching problems. UFM exhibits versatility in addressing both feature matching tasks within the same modal and those across different modals. Additionally, we propose a data augmentation algorithm and a staged pre-training strategy to effectively tackle challenges arising from sparse data in specific modals and imbalanced modal datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that UFM excels in generalization and performance across various feature matching tasks. The code will be released at:https://github.com/LiaoYun0x0/UFM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boan Zhang, Hang Dong, Jiongge Zhang, Long Tian, Rongrong Wang, Zhenhua Wu, Xiyang Liu, Hongwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional range-instantaneous Doppler (RID) methods for rigid-body target imaging often suffer from low resolution due to the limitations of time-frequency analysis (TFA). To address this challenge, our primary focus is on obtaining high resolution time-frequency representations (TFRs) from their low resolution counterparts. Recognizing that the curve features of TFRs are a specific type of texture feature, we argue that pre trained generative models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) are well suited for enhancing TFRs, thanks to their powerful capability in capturing texture representations. Building on this insight, we propose a novel inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging method for rigid-body targets, leveraging the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of a pre-trained SD model. Our approach adopts the basic structure and pre-trained parameters of SD Turbo while incorporating additional linear operations for LoRA and adversarial training to achieve super-resolution and noise suppression. Then we integrate LoRA-SD into the RID-based ISAR imaging, enabling sharply focused and denoised imaging with super-resolution capabilities. We evaluate our method using both simulated and real radar data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in frequency es timation and ISAR imaging compared to traditional methods. Notably, the generalization capability is verified by training on simulated radar data and testing on measured radar data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitong Liu, Kuofeng Gao, Yang Bai, Jinmin Li, Jinxiao Shan, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, video-based large language models (video-based LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various video comprehension tasks. However, this rapid advancement raises significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the unauthorized use of personal video data in automated annotation by video-based LLMs. These unauthorized annotated video-text pairs can then be used to improve the performance of downstream tasks, such as text-to-video generation. To safeguard personal videos from unauthorized use, we propose two series of protective video watermarks with imperceptible adversarial perturbations, named Ramblings and Mutes. Concretely, Ramblings aim to mislead video-based LLMs into generating inaccurate captions for the videos, thereby degrading the quality of video annotations through inconsistencies between video content and captions. Mutes, on the other hand, are designed to prompt video-based LLMs to produce exceptionally brief captions, lacking descriptive detail. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our video watermarking methods effectively protect video data by significantly reducing video annotation performance across various video-based LLMs, showcasing both stealthiness and robustness in protecting personal video content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Phil Pacot, Jayno Juventud, Gleen Dalaorao</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge detection remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision, especially under varying illumination, noise, and complex scene conditions. This paper introduces a Hybrid Multi-Stage Learning Framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to improve edge localization and structural accuracy. Unlike conventional end-to-end deep learning models, our approach decouples feature representation and classification stages, enhancing robustness and interpretability. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets such as BSDS500 and NYUDv2 demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional edge detectors and even recent learning-based methods in terms of Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) and Optimal Image Scale (OIS), while maintaining competitive Average Precision (AP). Both qualitative and quantitative results highlight enhanced performance on edge continuity, noise suppression, and perceptual clarity achieved by our method. This work not only bridges classical and deep learning paradigms but also sets a new direction for scalable, interpretable, and high-quality edge detection solutions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21830">Shape Generation via Weight Space Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Plattner, Arturs Berzins, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models for 3D shape generation have recently shown a remarkable capacity to encode rich geometric priors across both global and local dimensions. However, leveraging these priors for downstream tasks can be challenging as real-world data are often scarce or noisy, and traditional fine-tuning can lead to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we treat the weight space of a large 3D shape-generative model as a data modality that can be explored directly. We hypothesize that submanifolds within this high-dimensional weight space can modulate topological properties or fine-grained part features separately, demonstrating early-stage evidence via two experiments. First, we observe a sharp phase transition in global connectivity when interpolating in conditioning space, suggesting that small changes in weight space can drastically alter topology. Second, we show that low-dimensional reparameterizations yield controlled local geometry changes even with very limited data. These results highlight the potential of weight space learning to unlock new approaches for 3D shape generation and specialized fine-tuning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21834">A Multi-Modal Knowledge-Enhanced Framework for Vessel Trajectory Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Yu, Tianyi Li, Kristian Torp, Christian S. Jensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction facilitates improved navigational safety, routing, and environmental protection. However, existing prediction methods are challenged by the irregular sampling time intervals of the vessel tracking data from the global AIS system and the complexity of vessel movement. These aspects render model learning and generalization difficult. To address these challenges and improve vessel trajectory prediction, we propose the multi-modal knowledge-enhanced framework (MAKER) for vessel trajectory prediction. To contend better with the irregular sampling time intervals, MAKER features a Large language model-guided Knowledge Transfer (LKT) module that leverages pre-trained language models to transfer trajectory-specific contextual knowledge effectively. To enhance the ability to learn complex trajectory patterns, MAKER incorporates a Knowledge-based Self-paced Learning (KSL) module. This module employs kinematic knowledge to progressively integrate complex patterns during training, allowing for adaptive learning and enhanced generalization. Experimental results on two vessel trajectory datasets show that MAKER can improve the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art methods by 12.08%-17.86%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Wei, ZhiXiong Lan, Qing Yan, Ning Song, Ming Lv, LongQing Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Chromosome karyotype analysis is crucial for diagnosing hereditary diseases, yet detecting structural abnormalities remains challenging. While AI has shown promise in medical imaging, its effectiveness varies across modalities. Leveraging advances in Foundation Models that integrate multimodal medical imaging for robust feature extraction and accurate diagnosis, we developed iMedImage, an end-to-end model for general medical image recognition, demonstrating strong performance across multiple imaging tasks, including chromosome abnormality detection. Materials and Methods: We constructed a comprehensive medical image dataset encompassing multiple modalities from common medical domains, including chromosome, cell, pathology, ultrasound, X-ray, CT, and MRI images. Based on this dataset, we developed the iMedImage model, which incorporates the following key features: (1) a unified representation method for diverse modality inputs and medical imaging tasks; (2) multi-level (case-level, image-level, patch-level) image recognition capabilities enhanced by Chain of Thought (CoT) embedding and Mixture of Experts (MoE) strategies. Results: The test set comprised data from 12 institutions across six regions in China, covering three mainstream scanning devices, and included naturally distributed, unscreened abnormal cases. On this diverse dataset, the model achieved a fully automated chromosome analysis workflow, including segmentation, karyotyping, and abnormality detection, reaching a sensitivity of 92.75% and a specificity of 91.5%. Conclusion: We propose iMedImage, an end-to-end foundation model for medical image analysis, demonstrating its superior performance across various medical imaging tasks. iMedImage provides clinicians with a precise imaging analysis tool and contributes to improving diagnostic accuracy and disease screening.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21839">M-DocSum: Do LVLMs Genuinely Comprehend Interleaved Image-Text in Document Summarization?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolong Yan, Kaijun Tan, Yeqing Shen, Xin Huang, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Si Li, Daxin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate a critical yet under-explored question in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs): Do LVLMs genuinely comprehend interleaved image-text in the document? Existing document understanding benchmarks often assess LVLMs using question-answer formats, which are information-sparse and difficult to guarantee the coverage of long-range dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and challenging Multimodal Document Summarization Benchmark (M-DocSum-Bench), which comprises 500 high-quality arXiv papers, along with interleaved multimodal summaries aligned with human preferences. M-DocSum-Bench is a reference-based generation task and necessitates the generation of interleaved image-text summaries using provided reference images, thereby simultaneously evaluating capabilities in understanding, reasoning, localization, and summarization within complex multimodal document scenarios. To facilitate this benchmark, we develop an automated framework to construct summaries and propose a fine-grained evaluation method called M-DocEval. Moreover, we further develop a robust summarization baseline, i.e., M-DocSum-7B, by progressive two-stage training with diverse instruction and preference data. The extensive results on our M-DocSum-Bench reveal that the leading LVLMs struggle to maintain coherence and accurately integrate information within long and interleaved contexts, often exhibiting confusion between similar images and a lack of robustness. Notably, M-DocSum-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to larger and closed-source models (including GPT-4o, Gemini Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, etc.), demonstrating the potential of LVLMs for improved interleaved image-text understanding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtao Li, Yingyi Liu, Xinyu Wang, Yunning Peng, Chen Sun, Shaoyu Wang, Zhendong Sun, Tian Ke, Xiao Jiang, Tangwei Lu, Anran Zhao, Yanfei Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced interpretation of hyperspectral remote sensing images benefits many precise Earth observation tasks. Recently, visual foundation models have promoted the remote sensing interpretation but concentrating on RGB and multispectral images. Due to the varied hyperspectral channels,existing foundation models would face image-by-image tuning situation, imposing great pressure on hardware and time resources. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free hyperspectral foundation model called HyperFree, by adapting the existing visual prompt engineering. To process varied channel numbers, we design a learned weight dictionary covering full-spectrum from $0.4 \sim 2.5 \, \mu\text{m}$, supporting to build the embedding layer dynamically. To make the prompt design more tractable, HyperFree can generate multiple semantic-aware masks for one prompt by treating feature distance as semantic-similarity. After pre-training HyperFree on constructed large-scale high-resolution hyperspectral images, HyperFree (1 prompt) has shown comparable results with specialized models (5 shots) on 5 tasks and 11 datasets.Code and dataset are accessible at https://rsidea.whu.edu.cn/hyperfree.htm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a fundamental technology for numerous human - centered intelligent applications. Although deep learning methods have been utilized to accelerate feature extraction, issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment remain largely unresolved. The aim of this paper is to address issues such as multimodal data mixing, activity heterogeneity, and complex model deployment in sensor-based human activity recognition. We propose a spatiotemporal attention modal decomposition alignment fusion strategy to tackle the problem of the mixed distribution of sensor data. Key discriminative features of activities are captured through cross-modal spatio-temporal disentangled representation, and gradient modulation is combined to alleviate data heterogeneity. In addition, a wearable deployment simulation system is constructed. We conducted experiments on a large number of public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Attard, Dylan Seychell</p>
<p>Abstract: News videos require efficient content organisation and retrieval systems, but their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for automated processing. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of image, video, and audio classifiers for automated news video segmentation. This work presents the development and evaluation of multiple deep learning approaches, including ResNet, ViViT, AST, and multimodal architectures, to classify five distinct segment types: advertisements, stories, studio scenes, transitions, and visualisations. Using a custom-annotated dataset of 41 news videos comprising 1,832 scene clips, our experiments demonstrate that image-based classifiers achieve superior performance (84.34\% accuracy) compared to more complex temporal models. Notably, the ResNet architecture outperformed state-of-the-art video classifiers while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Binary classification models achieved high accuracy for transitions (94.23\%) and advertisements (92.74\%). These findings advance the understanding of effective architectures for news video segmentation and provide practical insights for implementing automated content organisation systems in media applications. These include media archiving, personalised content delivery, and intelligent video search.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21851">On Large Multimodal Models as Open-World Image Classifiers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alessandro Conti, Massimiliano Mancini, Enrico Fini, Yiming Wang, Paolo Rota, Elisa Ricci</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic categories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi Zeng, Wenxuan Liu, Tianhua Xia, Jinhui Chen, Ziyun Li, Sai Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) as it enables precise object recognition and interaction, enhancing the integration of virtual and real-world elements for an immersive experience. However, the high computational overhead of segmentation limits its application on resource-constrained AR/VR devices, causing large processing latency and degrading user experience. In contrast to conventional scenarios, AR/VR users typically focus on only a few regions within their field of view before shifting perspective, allowing segmentation to be concentrated on gaze-specific areas. This insight drives the need for efficient segmentation methods that prioritize processing instance of interest, reducing computational load and enhancing real-time performance. In this paper, we present a foveated instance segmentation (FovealSeg) framework that leverages real-time user gaze data to perform instance segmentation exclusively on instance of interest, resulting in substantial computational savings. Evaluation results show that FSNet achieves an IoU of 0.56 on ADE20K and 0.54 on LVIS, notably outperforming the baseline. The code is available at https://github.com/SAI-</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrice Bechard, Chao Wang, Amirhossein Abaskohi, Juan Rodriguez, Christopher Pal, David Vazquez, Spandana Gella, Sai Rajeswar, Perouz Taslakian</p>
<p>Abstract: Workflows are a fundamental component of automation in enterprise platforms, enabling the orchestration of tasks, data processing, and system integrations. Despite being widely used, building workflows can be complex, often requiring manual configuration through low-code platforms or visual programming tools. To simplify this process, we explore the use of generative foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), to automatically generate structured workflows from visual inputs. Translating hand-drawn sketches or computer-generated diagrams into executable workflows is challenging due to the ambiguity of free-form drawings, variations in diagram styles, and the difficulty of inferring execution logic from visual elements. To address this, we introduce StarFlow, a framework for generating structured workflow outputs from sketches using vision-language models. We curate a diverse dataset of workflow diagrams -- including synthetic, manually annotated, and real-world samples -- to enable robust training and evaluation. We finetune and benchmark multiple vision-language models, conducting a series of ablation studies to analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results show that finetuning significantly enhances structured workflow generation, outperforming large vision-language models on this task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taufiq Ahmed, Abhishek Kumar, Constantino \'Alvarez Casado, Anlan Zhang, Tuomo H\"anninen, Lauri Loven, Miguel Bordallo L\'opez, Sasu Tarkoma</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection models often struggle with class imbalance, where rare categories appear significantly less frequently than common ones. Existing sampling-based rebalancing strategies, such as Repeat Factor Sampling (RFS) and Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (IRFS), mitigate this issue by adjusting sample frequencies based on image and instance counts. However, these methods are based on linear adjustments, which limit their effectiveness in long-tailed distributions. This work introduces Exponentially Weighted Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (E-IRFS), an extension of IRFS that applies exponential scaling to better differentiate between rare and frequent classes. E-IRFS adjusts sampling probabilities using an exponential function applied to the geometric mean of image and instance frequencies, ensuring a more adaptive rebalancing strategy. We evaluate E-IRFS on a dataset derived from the Fireman-UAV-RGBT Dataset and four additional public datasets, using YOLOv11 object detection models to identify fire, smoke, people and lakes in emergency scenarios. The results show that E-IRFS improves detection performance by 22\% over the baseline and outperforms RFS and IRFS, particularly for rare categories. The analysis also highlights that E-IRFS has a stronger effect on lightweight models with limited capacity, as these models rely more on data sampling strategies to address class imbalance. The findings demonstrate that E-IRFS improves rare object detection in resource-constrained environments, making it a suitable solution for real-time applications such as UAV-based emergency monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Yang, Chen Gao, Jing Liu, Peng Wu, Guansong Pang, Mike Zheng Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Heinimann, Assaf Shocher, Tal Zimbalist, Michal Irani</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional super-resolution (SR) methods assume an ``ideal'' downscaling SR-kernel (e.g., bicubic downscaling) between the high-resolution (HR) image and the low-resolution (LR) image. Such methods fail once the LR images are generated differently. Current blind-SR methods aim to remove this assumption, but are still fundamentally restricted to rather simplistic downscaling SR-kernels (e.g., anisotropic Gaussian kernels), and fail on more complex (out of distribution) downscaling degradations. However, using the correct SR-kernel is often more important than using a sophisticated SR algorithm. In ``KernelFusion'' we introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based method that makes no assumptions about the kernel. Our method recovers the unique image-specific SR-kernel directly from the LR input image, while simultaneously recovering its corresponding HR image. KernelFusion exploits the principle that the correct SR-kernel is the one that maximizes patch similarity across different scales of the LR image. We first train an image-specific patch-based diffusion model on the single LR input image, capturing its unique internal patch statistics. We then reconstruct a larger HR image with the same learned patch distribution, while simultaneously recovering the correct downscaling SR-kernel that maintains this cross-scale relation between the HR and LR images. Empirical results show that KernelFusion vastly outperforms all SR baselines on complex downscaling degradations, where existing SotA Blind-SR methods fail miserably. By breaking free from predefined kernel assumptions, KernelFusion pushes Blind-SR into a new assumption-free paradigm, handling downscaling kernels previously thought impossible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Hamidreza Nabaei, Zeyang Zheng, Dong Chen, Arsalan Heydarian</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor gardening within sustainable buildings offers a transformative solution to urban food security and environmental sustainability. By 2030, urban farming, including Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and vertical farming, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% from 2024 to 2030, according to market reports. This growth is fueled by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, sustainable innovations such as smart growing systems, and the rising interest in green interior design. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates computer vision, machine learning (ML), and environmental sensing for the automated monitoring of plant health and growth. Unlike previous approaches, this framework combines RGB imagery, plant phenotyping data, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, to predict plant water stress in a controlled growth environment. The system utilizes high-resolution cameras to extract phenotypic features, such as RGB, plant area, height, and width while employing the Lag-Llama time series model to analyze and predict water stress. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RGB, size ratios, and environmental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy, with the Fine-tuned model achieving the lowest errors (MSE = 0.420777, MAE = 0.595428) and reduced uncertainty. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data and intelligent systems to automate plant care, optimize resource consumption, and align indoor gardening with sustainable building management practices, paving the way for resilient, green urban spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roxana Bujack, Emily Shinkle, Alice Allen, Tomas Suk, Nicholas Lubbers</p>
<p>Abstract: Moment invariants are a powerful tool for the generation of rotation-invariant descriptors needed for many applications in pattern detection, classification, and machine learning. A set of invariants is optimal if it is complete, independent, and robust against degeneracy in the input. In this paper, we show that the current state of the art for the generation of these bases of moment invariants, despite being robust against moment tensors being identically zero, is vulnerable to a degeneracy that is common in real-world applications, namely spherical functions. We show how to overcome this vulnerability by combining two popular moment invariant approaches: one based on spherical harmonics and one based on Cartesian tensor algebra.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Cai, Tsung-Wei Huang, Shiv Gehlot, Brandon Y. Feng, Sachin Shah, Guan-Ming Su, Christopher Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse portraits, but lack intuitive shadow control. Existing editing approaches, as post-processing, struggle to offer effective manipulation across diverse styles. Additionally, these methods either rely on expensive real-world light-stage data collection or require extensive computational resources for training. To address these limitations, we introduce Shadow Director, a method that extracts and manipulates hidden shadow attributes within well-trained diffusion models. Our approach uses a small estimation network that requires only a few thousand synthetic images and hours of training-no costly real-world light-stage data needed. Shadow Director enables parametric and intuitive control over shadow shape, placement, and intensity during portrait generation while preserving artistic integrity and identity across diverse styles. Despite training only on synthetic data built on real-world identities, it generalizes effectively to generated portraits with diverse styles, making it a more accessible and resource-friendly solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taqwa I. Alhadidi, Asmaa Alazmi, Shadi Jaradat, Ahmed Jaber, Huthaifa Ashqar, Mohammed Elhenawy</p>
<p>Abstract: Pavement distress, such as cracks and potholes, is a significant issue affecting road safety and maintenance. In this study, we present the implementation and evaluation of Bidirectional Cascaded Neural Networks (BCNNs) for the classification of pavement crack images following image augmentation. We classified pavement cracks into three main categories: linear cracks, potholes, and fatigue cracks on an enhanced dataset utilizing U-Net 50 for image augmentation. The augmented dataset comprised 599 images. Our proposed BCNN model was designed to leverage both forward and backward information flows, with detection accuracy enhanced by its cascaded structure wherein each layer progressively refines the output of the preceding one. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 87%, with precision, recall, and F1-score measures indicating high effectiveness across the categories. For fatigue cracks, the model recorded a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.83, and F1-score of 0.85 on 205 images. Linear cracks were detected with a precision of 0.81, recall of 0.89, and F1-score of 0.85 on 205 images, and potholes with a precision of 0.96, recall of 0.90, and F1-score of 0.93 on 189 images. The macro and weighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score were identical at 0.88, confirming the BCNN's excellent performance in classifying complex pavement crack patterns. This research demonstrates the potential of BCNNs to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of pavement distress classification, resulting in more effective and efficient pavement maintenance and management systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kibon Ku, Talukder Z Jubery, Elijah Rodriguez, Aditya Balu, Soumik Sarkar, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a NeRF-based framework for point cloud (PCD) reconstruction, specifically designed for indoor high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities. Traditional NeRF-based reconstruction methods require cameras to move around stationary objects, but this approach is impractical for high-throughput environments where objects are rapidly imaged while moving on conveyors or rotating pedestals. To address this limitation, we develop a variant of NeRF-based PCD reconstruction that uses a single stationary camera to capture images as the object rotates on a pedestal. Our workflow comprises COLMAP-based pose estimation, a straightforward pose transformation to simulate camera movement, and subsequent standard NeRF training. A defined Region of Interest (ROI) excludes irrelevant scene data, enabling the generation of high-resolution point clouds (10M points). Experimental results demonstrate excellent reconstruction fidelity, with precision-recall analyses yielding an F-score close to 100.00 across all evaluated plant objects. Although pose estimation remains computationally intensive with a stationary camera setup, overall training and reconstruction times are competitive, validating the method's feasibility for practical high-throughput indoor phenotyping applications. Our findings indicate that high-quality NeRF-based 3D reconstructions are achievable using a stationary camera, eliminating the need for complex camera motion or costly imaging equipment. This approach is especially beneficial when employing expensive and delicate instruments, such as hyperspectral cameras, for 3D plant phenotyping. Future work will focus on optimizing pose estimation techniques and further streamlining the methodology to facilitate seamless integration into automated, high-throughput 3D phenotyping pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Chen, Haotong Qin, Zhang Zhang, Michelo Magno, Luca Benini, Yawei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have attracted considerable attention in Image Restoration (IR) due to their ability to scale linearly sequence length while effectively capturing long-distance dependencies. However, deploying SSMs to edge devices is challenging due to the constraints in memory, computing capacity, and power consumption, underscoring the need for efficient compression strategies. While low-bit quantization is an efficient model compression strategy for reducing size and accelerating IR tasks, SSM suffers substantial performance drops at ultra-low bit-widths (2-4 bits), primarily due to outliers that exacerbate quantization error. To address this challenge, we propose Q-MambaIR, an accurate, efficient, and flexible Quantized Mamba for IR tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Statistical Dynamic-balancing Learnable Scalar (DLS) to dynamically adjust the quantization mapping range, thereby mitigating the peak truncation loss caused by extreme values. Furthermore, we design a Range-floating Flexible Allocator (RFA) with an adaptive threshold to flexibly round values. This approach preserves high-frequency details and maintains the SSM's feature extraction capability. Notably, RFA also enables pre-deployment weight quantization, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy. Extensive experiments on IR tasks demonstrate that Q-MambaIR consistently outperforms existing quantized SSMs, achieving much higher state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy results with only a negligible increase in training computation and storage saving.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21979">Harmonizing Visual Representations for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Size Wu, Wenwei Zhang, Lumin Xu, Sheng Jin, Zhonghua Wu, Qingyi Tao, Wentao Liu, Wei Li, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: Unifying visual understanding and generation within a single multimodal framework remains a significant challenge, as the two inherently heterogeneous tasks require representations at different levels of granularity. Current approaches that utilize vector quantization (VQ) or variational autoencoders (VAE) for unified visual representation prioritize intrinsic imagery features over semantics, compromising understanding performance. In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21990">AgRowStitch: A High-fidelity Image Stitching Pipeline for Ground-based Agricultural Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Kazuo Uyehara, Heesup Yun, Earl Ranario, Mason Earles</p>
<p>Abstract: Agricultural imaging often requires individual images to be stitched together into a final mosaic for analysis. However, agricultural images can be particularly challenging to stitch because feature matching across images is difficult due to repeated textures, plants are non-planar, and mosaics built from many images can accumulate errors that cause drift. Although these issues can be mitigated by using georeferenced images or taking images at high altitude, there is no general solution for images taken close to the crop. To address this, we created a user-friendly and open source pipeline for stitching ground-based images of a linear row of crops that does not rely on additional data. First, we use SuperPoint and LightGlue to extract and match features within small batches of images. Then we stitch the images in each batch in series while imposing constraints on the camera movement. After straightening and rescaling each batch mosaic, all batch mosaics are stitched together in series and then straightened into a final mosaic. We tested the pipeline on images collected along 72 m long rows of crops using two different agricultural robots and a camera manually carried over the row. In all three cases, the pipeline produced high-quality mosaics that could be used to georeference real world positions with a mean absolute error of 20 cm. This approach provides accessible leaf-scale stitching to users who need to coarsely georeference positions within a row, but do not have access to accurate positional data or sophisticated imaging systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhou, Xinxin Zuo, Rui Ma, Li Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the copy-paste image-to-image composition problem with a focus on object placement learning. Prior methods have leveraged generative models to reduce the reliance for dense supervision. However, this often limits their capacity to model complex data distributions. Alternatively, transformer networks with a sparse contrastive loss have been explored, but their over-relaxed regularization often leads to imprecise object placement. We introduce BOOTPLACE, a novel paradigm that formulates object placement as a placement-by-detection problem. Our approach begins by identifying suitable regions of interest for object placement. This is achieved by training a specialized detection transformer on object-subtracted backgrounds, enhanced with multi-object supervisions. It then semantically associates each target compositing object with detected regions based on their complementary characteristics. Through a boostrapped training approach applied to randomly object-subtracted images, our model enforces meaningful placements through extensive paired data augmentation. Experimental results on established benchmarks demonstrate BOOTPLACE's superior performance in object repositioning, markedly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on Cityscapes and OPA datasets with notable improvements in IOU scores. Additional ablation studies further showcase the compositionality and generalizability of our approach, supported by user study evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tony Tran, Bin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for deep learning object detection frameworks typically involves multiple modules, each performing distinct tasks. These modules contribute to a vast search space, resulting in searches that can take several GPU hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the search space. This makes joint optimization both challenging and computationally expensive. Furthermore, satisfying target device constraints across modules adds additional complexity to the optimization process. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FACETS}, e\textbf{\underline{F}}ficient Once-for-\textbf{\underline{A}}ll Object Detection via \textbf{\underline{C}}onstrained it\textbf{\underline{E}}ra\textbf{\underline{T}}ive\textbf{\underline{S}}earch, a novel unified iterative NAS method that refines the architecture of all modules in a cyclical manner. FACETS leverages feedback from previous iterations, alternating between fixing one module's architecture and optimizing the others. This approach reduces the overall search space while preserving interdependencies among modules and incorporates constraints based on the target device's computational budget. In a controlled comparison against progressive and single-module search strategies, FACETS achieves architectures with up to $4.75\%$ higher accuracy twice as fast as progressive search strategies in earlier stages, while still being able to achieve a global optimum. Moreover, FACETS demonstrates the ability to iteratively refine the search space, producing better performing architectures over time. The refined search space yields candidates with a mean accuracy up to $27\%$ higher than global search and $5\%$ higher than progressive search methods via random sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Earl Ranario, Lars Lundqvist, Heesup Yun, Brian N. Bailey, J. Mason Earles</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantically consistent cross-domain image translation facilitates the generation of training data by transferring labels across different domains, making it particularly useful for plant trait identification in agriculture. However, existing generative models struggle to maintain object-level accuracy when translating images between domains, especially when domain gaps are significant. In this work, we introduce AGILE (Attention-Guided Image and Label Translation for Efficient Cross-Domain Plant Trait Identification), a diffusion-based framework that leverages optimized text embeddings and attention guidance to semantically constrain image translation. AGILE utilizes pretrained diffusion models and publicly available agricultural datasets to improve the fidelity of translated images while preserving critical object semantics. Our approach optimizes text embeddings to strengthen the correspondence between source and target images and guides attention maps during the denoising process to control object placement. We evaluate AGILE on cross-domain plant datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating semantically accurate translated images. Quantitative experiments show that AGILE enhances object detection performance in the target domain while maintaining realism and consistency. Compared to prior image translation methods, AGILE achieves superior semantic alignment, particularly in challenging cases where objects vary significantly or domain gaps are substantial.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown potential in leveraging pretrained vision-language models and diverse robot demonstrations for learning generalizable sensorimotor control. While this paradigm effectively utilizes large-scale data from both robotic and non-robotic sources, current VLAs primarily focus on direct input--output mappings, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps crucial for complex manipulation tasks. As a result, existing VLAs lack temporal planning or reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that incorporates explicit visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into vision-language-action models (VLAs) by predicting future image frames autoregressively as visual goals before generating a short action sequence to achieve these goals. We introduce CoT-VLA, a state-of-the-art 7B VLA that can understand and generate visual and action tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoT-VLA achieves strong performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art VLA model by 17% in real-world manipulation tasks and 6% in simulation benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> SaiKiran Tedla, Junyong Lee, Beixuan Yang, Mahmoud Afifi, Michael Brown</p>
<p>Abstract: Multispectral (MS) images capture detailed scene information across a wide range of spectral bands, making them invaluable for applications requiring rich spectral data. Integrating MS imaging into multi camera devices, such as smartphones, has the potential to enhance both spectral applications and RGB image quality. A critical step in processing MS data is demosaicing, which reconstructs color information from the mosaic MS images captured by the camera. This paper proposes a method for MS image demosaicing specifically designed for dual-camera setups where both RGB and MS cameras capture the same scene. Our approach leverages co-captured RGB images, which typically have higher spatial fidelity, to guide the demosaicing of lower-fidelity MS images. We introduce the Dual-camera RGB-MS Dataset - a large collection of paired RGB and MS mosaiced images with ground-truth demosaiced outputs - that enables training and evaluation of our method. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tai An, Weiqiang Huang, Da Xu, Qingyuan He, Jiacheng Hu, Yujia Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: As a fundamental task in computer vision, semantic segmentation is widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis, and medical image processing. In recent years, Transformer-based segmentation methods have demonstrated strong performance in global feature modeling. However, they still struggle with blurred target boundaries and insufficient recognition of small targets. To address these issues, this study proposes a Mask2Former-based semantic segmentation algorithm incorporating a boundary enhancement feature bridging module (BEFBM). The goal is to improve target boundary accuracy and segmentation consistency. Built upon the Mask2Former framework, this method constructs a boundary-aware feature map and introduces a feature bridging mechanism. This enables effective cross-scale feature fusion, enhancing the model's ability to focus on target boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that, compared to mainstream segmentation methods, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in metrics such as mIOU, mDICE, and mRecall. It also exhibits superior boundary retention in complex scenes. Visual analysis further confirms the model's advantages in fine-grained regions. Future research will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and exploring its potential in other high-precision segmentation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ukcheol Shin, Jinsun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving robust and accurate spatial perception under adverse weather and lighting conditions is crucial for the high-level autonomy of self-driving vehicles and robots. However, existing perception algorithms relying on the visible spectrum are highly affected by weather and lighting conditions. A long-wave infrared camera (i.e., thermal imaging camera) can be a potential solution to achieve high-level robustness. However, the absence of large-scale datasets and standardized benchmarks remains a significant bottleneck to progress in active research for robust visual perception from thermal images. To this end, this manuscript provides a large-scale Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS$^2$) dataset that consists of stereo RGB, stereo NIR, stereo thermal, stereo LiDAR data, and GNSS/IMU information along with semi-dense depth ground truth. MS$^2$ dataset includes 162K synchronized multi-modal data pairs captured across diverse locations (e.g., urban city, residential area, campus, and high-way road) at different times (e.g., morning, daytime, and nighttime) and under various weather conditions (e.g., clear-sky, cloudy, and rainy). Secondly, we conduct a thorough evaluation of monocular and stereo depth estimation networks across RGB, NIR, and thermal modalities to establish standardized benchmark results on MS$^2$ depth test sets (e.g., day, night, and rainy). Lastly, we provide in-depth analyses and discuss the challenges revealed by the benchmark results, such as the performance variability for each modality under adverse conditions, domain shift between different sensor modalities, and potential research direction for thermal perception.

<p>Abstract: Breast cancer, the most common malignancy among women, requires precise detection and classification for effective treatment. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers like HER2, ER, and PR are critical for identifying breast cancer subtypes. However, traditional IHC classification relies on pathologists' expertise, making it labor-intensive and subject to significant inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, this study introduces the India Pathology Breast Cancer Dataset (IPD-Breast), comprising of 1,272 IHC slides (HER2, ER, and PR) aimed at automating receptor status classification. The primary focus is on developing predictive models for HER2 3-way classification (0, Low, High) to enhance prognosis. Evaluation of multiple deep learning models revealed that an end-to-end ConvNeXt network utilizing low-resolution IHC images achieved an AUC, F1, and accuracy of 91.79%, 83.52%, and 83.56%, respectively, for 3-way classification, outperforming patch-based methods by over 5.35% in F1 score. This study highlights the potential of simple yet effective deep learning techniques to significantly improve accuracy and reproducibility in breast cancer classification, supporting their integration into clinical workflows for better patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunshan Yang, Wenwei Luo, Yuguo Hu, Jiafu Yan, Mengmeng Jing, Lin Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Flexible objects recognition remains a significant challenge due to its inherently diverse shapes and sizes, translucent attributes, and subtle inter-class differences. Graph-based models, such as graph convolution networks and graph vision models, are promising in flexible objects recognition due to their ability of capturing variable relations within the flexible objects. These methods, however, often focus on global visual relationships or fail to align semantic and visual information. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a semantic-enhanced heterogeneous graph learning method. First, an adaptive scanning module is employed to extract discriminative semantic context, facilitating the matching of flexible objects with varying shapes and sizes while aligning semantic and visual nodes to enhance cross-modal feature correlation. Second, a heterogeneous graph generation module aggregates global visual and local semantic node features, improving the recognition of flexible objects. Additionally, We introduce the FSCW, a large-scale flexible dataset curated from existing sources. We validate our method through extensive experiments on flexible datasets (FDA and FSCW), and challenge benchmarks (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Hard), demonstrating competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyue Huang, Hongxi Yan, Qiqi Zhan, Shuai Yang, Mingming Zhang, Chenkai Zhang, YiMing Lei, Zeming Liu, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of remote sensing foundation models, particularly vision and multimodal models, has significantly enhanced the capabilities of intelligent geospatial data interpretation. These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of the current landscape of remote sensing foundation models and inspire future research that can push the boundaries of what these models can achieve in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokha Moon, Janghyun Baek, Giseop Kim, Jinkyu Kim, Sunwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction has emerged as a key perception task for autonomous driving, as it reconstructs 3D environments to provide a comprehensive scene understanding. Recent studies focus on integrating spatiotemporal information obtained from past observations to improve prediction accuracy, using a multi-frame fusion approach that processes multiple past frames together. However, these methods struggle with a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, which significantly limits their practicality. To mitigate this trade-off, we propose StreamOcc, a novel framework that aggregates spatio-temporal information in a stream-based manner. StreamOcc consists of two key components: (i) Stream-based Voxel Aggregation, which effectively accumulates past observations while minimizing computational costs, and (ii) Query-guided Aggregation, which recurrently aggregates instance-level features of dynamic objects into corresponding voxel features, refining fine-grained details of dynamic objects. Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset show that StreamOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time settings, while reducing memory usage by more than 50% compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ximing Wen, Mallika Mainali, Anik Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks; However, their ability to perform Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks such as accurately inferring human intentions, beliefs, and other mental states remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an open-ended question framework to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' performance across diverse categories of ToM tasks. We curated and annotated a benchmark dataset composed of 30 images. We then assessed the performance of four VLMs of varying sizes on this dataset. Our experimental results show that the GPT-4 model outperformed all others, with only one smaller model, GPT-4o-mini, achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we observed that VLMs often struggle to accurately infer intentions in complex scenarios such as bullying or cheating. Moreover, our findings also reveal that smaller models can sometimes infer correct intentions despite relying on incorrect visual cues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Protyay Dey, Rejoy Chakraborty, Abhilasha S. Jadhav, Kapil Rana, Gaurav Sharma, Puneet Goyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Source camera model identification (SCMI) plays a pivotal role in image forensics with applications including authenticity verification and copyright protection. For identifying the camera model used to capture a given image, we propose SPAIR-Swin, a novel model combining a modified spatial attention mechanism and inverted residual block (SPAIR) with a Swin Transformer. SPAIR-Swin effectively captures both global and local features, enabling robust identification of artifacts such as noise patterns that are particularly effective for SCMI. Additionally, unlike conventional methods focusing on homogeneous patches, we propose a patch selection strategy for SCMI that emphasizes high-entropy regions rich in patterns and textures. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark SCMI datasets demonstrate that SPAIR-Swin outperforms existing methods, achieving patch-level accuracies of 99.45%, 98.39%, 99.45%, and 97.46% and image-level accuracies of 99.87%, 99.32%, 100%, and 98.61% on the Dresden, Vision, Forchheim, and Socrates datasets, respectively. Our findings highlight that high-entropy patches, which contain high-frequency information such as edge sharpness, noise, and compression artifacts, are more favorable in improving SCMI accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tharun Anand, Siva Sankar, Pravin Nair</p>
<p>Abstract: With rapid advancements in generative modeling, deepfake techniques are increasingly narrowing the gap between real and synthetic videos, raising serious privacy and security concerns. Beyond traditional face swapping and reenactment, an emerging trend in recent state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods involves localized edits such as subtle manipulations of specific facial features like raising eyebrows, altering eye shapes, or modifying mouth expressions. These fine-grained manipulations pose a significant challenge for existing detection models, which struggle to capture such localized variations. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first detection approach explicitly designed to generalize to localized edits in deepfake videos by leveraging spatiotemporal representations guided by facial action units. Our method leverages a cross-attention-based fusion of representations learned from pretext tasks like random masking and action unit detection, to create an embedding that effectively encodes subtle, localized changes. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple deepfake generation methods demonstrate that our approach, despite being trained solely on the traditional FF+ dataset, sets a new benchmark in detecting recent deepfake-generated videos with fine-grained local edits, achieving a $20\%$ improvement in accuracy over current state-of-the-art detection methods. Additionally, our method delivers competitive performance on standard datasets, highlighting its robustness and generalization across diverse types of local and global forgeries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Beleacov</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated construction is one of the most promising areas that can improve efficiency, reduce costs and minimize errors in the process of building construction. In this paper, a comparative analysis of three neural network models for semantic segmentation, U-Net(light), LinkNet and PSPNet, is performed. Two specialized datasets with images of houses built from wooden cubes were created for the experiments. The first dataset contains 4 classes (background, foundation, walls, roof ) and is designed for basic model evaluation, while the second dataset includes 44 classes where each cube is labeled as a separate object. The models were trained with the same hyperparameters and their accuracy was evaluated using MeanIoU and F1 Score metrics. According to the results obtained, U-Net(light) showed the best performance with 78% MeanIoU and 87% F1 Score on the first dataset and 17% and 25% respectively on the second dataset. The poor results on the second dataset are due to the limited amount of data, the complexity of the partitioning and the imbalance of classes, making it difficult to accurately select individual cubes. In addition, overtraining was observed in all experiments, manifested by high accuracy on the training dataset and its significant decrease on the validation dataset. The present work is the basis for the development of algorithms for automatic generation of staged building plans, which can be further scaled to design complete buildings. Future research is planned to extend the datasets and apply methods to combat overfitting (L1/L2 regularization, Early Stopping). The next stage of work will be the development of algorithms for automatic generation of a step-by-step plan for building houses from cubes using manipulators.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22136">Beyond Background Shift: Rethinking Instance Replay in Continual Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongmei Yin, Tingliang Feng, Fan Lyu, Fanhua Shang, Hongying Liu, Wei Feng, Liang Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on continual semantic segmentation (CSS), where segmentation networks are required to continuously learn new classes without erasing knowledge of previously learned ones. Although storing images of old classes and directly incorporating them into the training of new models has proven effective in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in classification tasks, this strategy presents notable limitations in CSS. Specifically, the stored and new images with partial category annotations leads to confusion between unannotated categories and the background, complicating model fitting. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel Enhanced Instance Replay (EIR) method, which not only preserves knowledge of old classes while simultaneously eliminating background confusion by instance storage of old classes, but also mitigates background shifts in the new images by integrating stored instances with new images. By effectively resolving background shifts in both stored and new images, EIR alleviates catastrophic forgetting in the CSS task, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for CSS. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CSS methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Vijay Veerabadran, Michael L. Iuzzolino, Brett D. Roads, Asli Celikyilmaz, Karl Ridgeway</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce EgoToM, a new video question-answering benchmark that extends Theory-of-Mind (ToM) evaluation to egocentric domains. Using a causal ToM model, we generate multi-choice video QA instances for the Ego4D dataset to benchmark the ability to predict a camera wearer's goals, beliefs, and next actions. We study the performance of both humans and state of the art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on these three interconnected inference problems. Our evaluation shows that MLLMs achieve close to human-level accuracy on inferring goals from egocentric videos. However, MLLMs (including the largest ones we tested with over 100B parameters) fall short of human performance when inferring the camera wearers' in-the-moment belief states and future actions that are most consistent with the unseen video future. We believe that our results will shape the future design of an important class of egocentric digital assistants which are equipped with a reasonable model of the user's internal mental states.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jae-Young Yim, Dongwook Kim, Jae-Young Sim</p>
<p>Abstract: We should collect large amount of data to train deep neural networks for various applications. Recently, the dataset distillation for images and texts has been attracting a lot of attention, that reduces the original dataset to a synthetic dataset while preserving essential task-relevant information. However, 3D point clouds distillation is almost unexplored due to the challenges of unordered structures of points. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution matching-based dataset distillation method for 3D point clouds that jointly optimizes the geometric structures of synthetic dataset as well as the orientations of synthetic models. To ensure the consistent feature alignment between different 3D point cloud models, we devise a permutation invariant distribution matching loss with the sorted feature vectors. We also employ learnable rotation angles to transform each syntheic model according to the optimal orientation best representing the original feature distribution. Extensive experimental results on widely used four benchmark datasets, including ModelNet10, ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanObjectNN, demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woojung Han, Yeonkyung Lee, Chanyoung Kim, Kwanghyun Park, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have recently excelled in high-quality image generation, particularly in a training-free manner, enabling cost-effective adaptability and generalization across diverse tasks. However, while the existing methods have been continuously focusing on several challenges, such as "missing objects" and "mismatched attributes," another critical issue of "mislocated objects" remains where generated spatial positions fail to align with text prompts. Surprisingly, ensuring such seemingly basic functionality remains challenging in popular T2I models due to the inherent difficulty of imposing explicit spatial guidance via text forms. To address this, we propose STORM (Spatial Transport Optimization by Repositioning Attention Map), a novel training-free approach for spatially coherent T2I synthesis. STORM employs Spatial Transport Optimization (STO), rooted in optimal transport theory, to dynamically adjust object attention maps for precise spatial adherence, supported by a Spatial Transport (ST) Cost function that enhances spatial understanding. Our analysis shows that integrating spatial awareness is most effective in the early denoising stages, while later phases refine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STORM surpasses existing methods, effectively mitigating mislocated objects while improving missing and mismatched attributes, setting a new benchmark for spatial alignment in T2I synthesis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in Text-Based Person Retrieval (TBPR) research. Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minho Park, Sunghyun Park, Jungsoo Lee, Hyojin Park, Kyuwoong Hwang, Fatih Porikli, Jaegul Choo, Sungha Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in semantic segmentation by generating datasets through text-to-image (T2I) generation models, reducing image acquisition and labeling costs. Segmentation dataset generation faces two key challenges: 1) aligning generated samples with the target domain and 2) producing informative samples beyond the training data. Fine-tuning T2I models can help generate samples aligned with the target domain. However, it often overfits and memorizes training data, limiting their ability to generate diverse and well-aligned samples. To overcome these issues, we propose Concept-Aware LoRA (CA-LoRA), a novel fine-tuning approach that selectively identifies and updates only the weights associated with necessary concepts (e.g., style or viewpoint) for domain alignment while preserving the pretrained knowledge of the T2I model to produce informative samples. We demonstrate its effectiveness in generating datasets for urban-scene segmentation, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art methods in in-domain (few-shot and fully-supervised) settings, as well as in domain generalization tasks, especially under challenging conditions such as adverse weather and varying illumination, further highlighting its superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialun Pei, Zhangjun Zhou, Diandian Guo, Zhixi Li, Jing Qin, Bo Du, Pheng-Ann Heng</p>
<p>Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding in laparoscopic surgery causes rapid obscuration of the operative field to hinder the surgical process. Intelligent detection of bleeding regions can quantify the blood loss to assist decision-making, while locating the bleeding point helps surgeons quickly identify the source of bleeding and achieve hemostasis in time. In this study, we first construct a real-world surgical bleeding detection dataset, named SurgBlood, comprising 5,330 frames from 95 surgical video clips with bleeding region and point annotations. Accordingly, we develop a dual-task synergistic online detector called BlooDet, designed to perform simultaneous detection of bleeding regions and points in surgical videos. Our framework embraces a dual-branch bidirectional guidance design based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). The mask branch detects bleeding regions through adaptive edge and point prompt embeddings, while the point branch leverages mask memory to induce bleeding point memory modeling and captures the direction of bleed point movement through inter-frame optical flow. By interactive guidance and prompts, the two branches explore potential spatial-temporal relationships while leveraging memory modeling from previous frames to infer the current bleeding condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms other counterparts on SurgBlood in both bleeding region and point detection tasks, e.g., achieving 64.88% IoU for bleeding region detection and 83.69% PCK-10% for bleeding point detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Liu, Boyu Diao, Libo Huang, Hangda Liu, Chuanguang Yang, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to learn new tasks while retaining past knowledge, addressing the challenge of forgetting during task adaptation. Rehearsal-based methods, which replay previous samples, effectively mitigate forgetting. However, research on enhancing the efficiency of these methods, especially in resource-constrained environments, remains limited, hindering their application in real-world systems with dynamic data streams. The human perceptual system processes visual scenes through complementary frequency channels: low-frequency signals capture holistic cues, while high-frequency components convey structural details vital for fine-grained discrimination. Inspired by this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition and Integration Network (FDINet), a novel framework that decomposes and integrates information across frequencies. FDINet designs two lightweight networks to independently process low- and high-frequency components of images. When integrated with rehearsal-based methods, this frequency-aware design effectively enhances cross-task generalization through low-frequency information, preserves class-specific details using high-frequency information, and facilitates efficient training due to its lightweight architecture. Experiments demonstrate that FDINet reduces backbone parameters by 78%, improves accuracy by up to 7.49% over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and decreases peak memory usage by up to 80%. Additionally, on edge devices, FDINet accelerates training by up to 5$\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dailan He, Xiahong Wang, Shulun Wang, Guanglu Song, Bingqi Ma, Hao Shao, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Face swapping aims to seamlessly transfer a source facial identity onto a target while preserving target attributes such as pose and expression. Diffusion models, known for their superior generative capabilities, have recently shown promise in advancing face-swapping quality. This paper addresses two key challenges in diffusion-based face swapping: the prioritized preservation of identity over target attributes and the inherent conflict between identity and attribute conditioning. To tackle these issues, we introduce an identity-constrained attribute-tuning framework for face swapping that first ensures identity preservation and then fine-tunes for attribute alignment, achieved through a decoupled condition injection. We further enhance fidelity by incorporating identity and adversarial losses in a post-training refinement stage. Our proposed identity-constrained diffusion-based face-swapping model outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating superior identity similarity and attribute consistency, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity face swapping.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-quality data often suffer from insufficient image details, introducing an extra implicit aspect of camouflage that complicates camouflaged object detection (COD). Existing COD methods focus primarily on high-quality data, overlooking the challenges posed by low-quality data, which leads to significant performance degradation. Therefore, we propose KRNet, the first framework explicitly designed for COD on low-quality data. KRNet presents a Leader-Follower framework where the Leader extracts dual gold-standard distributions: conditional and hybrid, from high-quality data to drive the Follower in rectifying knowledge learned from low-quality data. The framework further benefits from a cross-consistency strategy that improves the rectification of these distributions and a time-dependent conditional encoder that enriches the distribution diversity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KRNet outperforms state-of-the-art COD methods and super-resolution-assisted COD approaches, proving its effectiveness in tackling the challenges of low-quality data in COD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Feixiang Liu, Jiale Du, Xinbo Gao, Jungong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks and supervised learning have achieved remarkable success in various fields but are limited by the need for large annotated datasets. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this limitation by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled examples. Transductive few-shot learning (TFSL) enhances FSL by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, though it faces challenges like the hubness problem. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Unbiased Max-Min Embedding Classification (UMMEC) Method, which addresses the key challenges in few-shot learning through three innovative contributions. First, we introduce a decentralized covariance matrix to mitigate the hubness problem, ensuring a more uniform distribution of embeddings. Second, our method combines local alignment and global uniformity through adaptive weighting and nonlinear transformation, balancing intra-class clustering with inter-class separation. Third, we employ a Variational Sinkhorn Few-Shot Classifier to optimize the distances between samples and class prototypes, enhancing classification accuracy and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhong Min, Daehyeon Choi, Kyeongmin Yeo, Jihyun Lee, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce ORIGEN, the first zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding in text-to-image generation across multiple objects and diverse categories. While previous work on spatial grounding in image generation has mainly focused on 2D positioning, it lacks control over 3D orientation. To address this, we propose a reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a one-step text-to-image generative flow model. While gradient-ascent-based optimization is a natural choice for reward-based guidance, it struggles to maintain image realism. Instead, we adopt a sampling-based approach using Langevin dynamics, which extends gradient ascent by simply injecting random noise--requiring just a single additional line of code. Additionally, we introduce adaptive time rescaling based on the reward function to accelerate convergence. Our experiments show that ORIGEN outperforms both training-based and test-time guidance methods across quantitative metrics and user studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Xun Zhang, Jiale Du, Xinbo Gao, Jungong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Learning(ZSL) attains knowledge transfer from seen classes to unseen classes by exploring auxiliary category information, which is a promising yet difficult research topic. In this field, Audio-Visual Generalized Zero-Shot Learning~(AV-GZSL) has aroused researchers' great interest in which intricate relations within triple modalities~(audio, video, and natural language) render this task quite challenging but highly research-worthy. However, both existing embedding-based and generative-based AV-GZSL methods tend to suffer from domain shift problem a lot and we propose an extremely simple Out-of-distribution~(OOD) detection based AV-GZSL method~(EZ-AVOOD) to further mitigate bias problem by differentiating seen and unseen samples at the initial beginning. EZ-AVOOD accomplishes effective seen-unseen separation by exploiting the intrinsic discriminative information held in class-specific logits and class-agnostic feature subspace without training an extra OOD detector network. Followed by seen-unseen binary classification, we employ two expert models to classify seen samples and unseen samples separately. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our model achieves superior ZSL and GZSL performances on three audio-visual datasets and becomes the new SOTA, which comprehensively demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed EZ-AVOOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Gao, Yunhe Zhang, Langkun Chen, Yan Jiang, Weiying Xie, Yunsong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Object tracking based on hyperspectral video attracts increasing attention to the rich material and motion information in the hyperspectral videos. The prevailing hyperspectral methods adapt pretrained RGB-based object tracking networks for hyperspectral tasks by fine-tuning the entire network on hyperspectral datasets, which achieves impressive results in challenging scenarios. However, the performance of hyperspectral trackers is limited by the loss of spectral information during the transformation, and fine-tuning the entire pretrained network is inefficient for practical applications. To address the issues, a new hyperspectral object tracking method, hyperspectral adapter for tracking (HyA-T), is proposed in this work. The hyperspectral adapter for the self-attention (HAS) and the hyperspectral adapter for the multilayer perceptron (HAM) are proposed to generate the adaption information and to transfer the multi-head self-attention (MSA) module and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in pretrained network for the hyperspectral object tracking task by augmenting the adaption information into the calculation of the MSA and MLP. Additionally, the hyperspectral enhancement of input (HEI) is proposed to augment the original spectral information into the input of the tracking network. The proposed methods extract spectral information directly from the hyperspectral images, which prevent the loss of the spectral information. Moreover, only the parameters in the proposed methods are fine-tuned, which is more efficient than the existing methods. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets with various spectral bands, verifing the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The HyA-T achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Jeong, Seohee Lee, Daehee Park, Giwon Lee, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving and mobile robot navigation. In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiren Lu, Yunlai Zhou, Yiran Qiao, Chaoda Song, Tuo Liang, Jing Ma, Yu Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is crucial for enabling more intelligent perception in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, and augmented reality. However, most existing methods rely on 2D pixel-level parsing, leading to multi-view inconsistencies and poor 3D object retrieval. Moreover, they are limited to static scenes and struggle with dynamic scenes due to the complexities of motion modeling. In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat, a 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic scenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long established approach of "segmentation after reconstruction" by dividing Gaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once the reconstruction is complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects, achieving true 3D segmentation. This approach not only eliminates Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic scenes but also accelerates the optimization process, as it eliminates the need for learning a separate language field. After optimization, a CLIP embedding is assigned to each object to enable open-vocabulary querying. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonhyeok Choi, Kyumin Hwang, Minwoo Choi, Kiljoon Han, Wonjoon Choi, Mingyu Shin, Sunghoon Im</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SSMDE) has gained attention in the field of deep learning as it estimates depth without requiring ground truth depth maps. This approach typically uses a photometric consistency loss between a synthesized image, generated from the estimated depth, and the original image, thereby reducing the need for extensive dataset acquisition. However, the conventional photometric consistency loss relies on the Lambertian assumption, which often leads to significant errors when dealing with reflective surfaces that deviate from this model. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates intrinsic image decomposition into SSMDE. Our method synergistically trains for both monocular depth estimation and intrinsic image decomposition. The accurate depth estimation facilitates multi-image consistency for intrinsic image decomposition by aligning different view coordinate systems, while the decomposition process identifies reflective areas and excludes corrupted gradients from the depth training process. Furthermore, our framework introduces a pseudo-depth generation and knowledge distillation technique to further enhance the performance of the student model across both reflective and non-reflective surfaces. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing SSMDE baselines in depth prediction, especially on reflective surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihan Zhou, Feng Hong, Jiaan Luo, Jiangchao Yao, Dongsheng Li, Bo Han, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose LIT, an advancement of visual instruction tuning (VIT). While VIT equips Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with promising multimodal capabilities, the current design choices for VIT often result in overfitting and shortcut learning, potentially degrading performance. This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, LIT adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, LIT achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, LIT attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Liu, Zhongliang Liu, Xiaoyan Yang, Man Sha, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D scene stylization approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve promising results by optimizing with Nearest Neighbor Feature Matching (NNFM) loss. However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225">Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijie Yang, Zhenyu Zhang, Hao Tang, Jianjun Qian, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishen Ji, Ziyue Zhu, Zhenxin Zhu, Kaixin Xiong, Ming Lu, Zhiqi Li, Lijun Zhou, Haiyang Sun, Bing Wang, Tong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in driving video generation has shown significant potential for enhancing self-driving systems by providing scalable and controllable training data. Although pretrained state-of-the-art generation models, guided by 2D layout conditions (e.g., HD maps and bounding boxes), can produce photorealistic driving videos, achieving controllable multi-view videos with high 3D consistency remains a major challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a novel spatial adaptive generation framework, CoGen, which leverages advances in 3D generation to improve performance in two key aspects: (i) To ensure 3D consistency, we first generate high-quality, controllable 3D conditions that capture the geometry of driving scenes. By replacing coarse 2D conditions with these fine-grained 3D representations, our approach significantly enhances the spatial consistency of the generated videos. (ii) Additionally, we introduce a consistency adapter module to strengthen the robustness of the model to multi-condition control. The results demonstrate that this method excels in preserving geometric fidelity and visual realism, offering a reliable video generation solution for autonomous driving.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Foundation Model (VFM) such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training Model (CLIP) has shown promising performance for segmentation and detection tasks. However, although SAM excels in fine-grained segmentation, it faces major challenges when applying it to semantic-aware segmentation. While CLIP exhibits a strong semantic understanding capability via aligning the global features of language and vision, it has deficiencies in fine-grained segmentation tasks. Human parsing requires to segment human bodies into constituent parts and involves both accurate fine-grained segmentation and high semantic understanding of each part. Based on traits of SAM and CLIP, we formulate high efficient modules to effectively integrate features of them to benefit human parsing. We propose a Semantic-Refinement Module to integrate semantic features of CLIP with SAM features to benefit parsing. Moreover, we formulate a high efficient Fine-tuning Module to adjust the pretrained SAM for human parsing that needs high semantic information and simultaneously demands spatial details, which significantly reduces the training time compared with full-time training and achieves notable performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LIP, PPP, and CIHP databases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate classification of building roof types from aerial imagery is crucial for various remote sensing applications, including urban planning, disaster management, and infrastructure monitoring. However, this task is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for supervised learning approaches. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the effectiveness of self supervised learning with EfficientNet architectures, known for their computational efficiency, for building roof type classification. We propose a novel framework that incorporates a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of EfficientNet. Furthermore, we explore the benefits of pretraining on a domain-specific dataset, the Aerial Image Dataset (AID), compared to ImageNet pretraining. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Employing Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) with EfficientNet-B3 and CBAM achieves a 95.5% accuracy on our validation set, matching the performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based models while utilizing significantly fewer parameters. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation on two challenging test sets, demonstrating the generalization capability of our method. Notably, our findings highlight the effectiveness of domain-specific pretraining, consistently leading to higher accuracy compared to models pretrained on the generic ImageNet dataset. Our work establishes EfficientNet based self-supervised learning as a computationally efficient and highly effective approach for building roof type classification, particularly beneficial in scenarios with limited labeled data.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of 3D devices and the shortage of 3D content, stereo conversion is attracting increasing attention. Recent works introduce pretrained Diffusion Models (DMs) into this task. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale training data and comprehensive benchmarks, the optimal methodologies for employing DMs in stereo conversion and the accurate evaluation of stereo effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the Mono2Stereo dataset, providing high-quality training data and benchmark to support in-depth exploration of stereo conversion. With this dataset, we conduct an empirical study that yields two primary findings. 1) The differences between the left and right views are subtle, yet existing metrics consider overall pixels, failing to concentrate on regions critical to stereo effects. 2) Mainstream methods adopt either one-stage left-to-right generation or warp-and-inpaint pipeline, facing challenges of degraded stereo effect and image distortion respectively. Based on these findings, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Stereo Intersection-over-Union, which prioritizes disparity and achieves a high correlation with human judgments on stereo effect. Moreover, we propose a strong baseline model, harmonizing the stereo effect and image quality simultaneously, and notably surpassing current mainstream methods. Our code and data will be open-sourced to promote further research in stereo conversion. Our models are available at mono2stereo-bench.github.io.</p>

<p>Abstract: Currently, high-quality, synchronized audio is synthesized using various multi-modal joint learning frameworks, leveraging video and optional text inputs. In the video-to-audio benchmarks, video-to-audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization are effectively achieved. However, in real-world scenarios, speech and audio often coexist in videos simultaneously, and the end-to-end generation of synchronous speech and audio given video and text conditions are not well studied. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal generation framework that simultaneously produces speech and audio based on video and text conditions. Furthermore, the advantages of video-to-audio (V2A) models for generating speech from videos remain unclear. The proposed framework, DeepAudio, consists of a video-to-audio (V2A) module, a text-to-speech (TTS) module, and a dynamic mixture of modality fusion (MoF) module. In the evaluation, the proposed end-to-end framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the video-audio benchmark, video-speech benchmark, and text-speech benchmark. In detail, our framework achieves comparable results in the comparison with state-of-the-art models for the video-audio and text-speech benchmarks, and surpassing state-of-the-art models in the video-speech benchmark, with WER 16.57% to 3.15% (+80.99%), SPK-SIM 78.30% to 89.38% (+14.15%), EMO-SIM 66.24% to 75.56% (+14.07%), MCD 8.59 to 7.98 (+7.10%), MCD SL 11.05 to 9.40 (+14.93%) across a variety of dubbing settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for achieving a high-level understanding of visual scenes and has numerous downstream applications. Humans can effortlessly segment moving objects in videos. Previous work has largely relied on optical flow to provide motion cues; however, this approach often results in imperfect predictions due to challenges such as partial motion, complex deformations, motion blur and background distractions. We propose a novel approach for moving object segmentation that combines long-range trajectory motion cues with DINO-based semantic features and leverages SAM2 for pixel-level mask densification through an iterative prompting strategy. Our model employs Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Attention and Motion-Semantic Decoupled Embedding to prioritize motion while integrating semantic support.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Loc Pham, Mathias Prokop, Bram van Ginneken, Alessa Hering</p>
<p>Abstract: Image registration is an essential technique for the analysis of Computed Tomography (CT) images in clinical practice. However, existing methodologies are predominantly tailored to a specific organ of interest and often exhibit lower performance on other organs, thus limiting their generalizability and applicability. Multi-organ registration addresses these limitations, but the simultaneous alignment of multiple organs with diverse shapes, sizes and locations requires a highly complex deformation field with a multi-layer composition of individual deformations. This study introduces a novel field decomposition approach to address the high complexity of deformations in multi-organ whole-body CT image registration. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of 691 patients, each with two CT images obtained at distinct time points. These scans fully encompass the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions. Two baseline registration methods are selected for this study: one based on optimization techniques and another based on deep learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in handling complex deformations in multi-organ whole-body CT image registration.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enabling object detectors to recognize out-of-distribution (OOD) objects is vital for building reliable systems. A primary obstacle stems from the fact that models frequently do not receive supervisory signals from unfamiliar data, leading to overly confident predictions regarding OOD objects. Despite previous progress that estimates OOD uncertainty based on the detection model and in-distribution (ID) samples, we explore using pre-trained vision-language representations for object-level OOD detection. We first discuss the limitations of applying image-level CLIP-based OOD detection methods to object-level scenarios. Building upon these insights, we propose RUNA, a novel framework that leverages a dual encoder architecture to capture rich contextual information and employs a regional uncertainty alignment mechanism to distinguish ID from OOD objects effectively. We introduce a few-shot fine-tuning approach that aligns region-level semantic representations to further improve the model's capability to discriminate between similar objects. Our experiments show that RUNA substantially surpasses state-of-the-art methods in object-level OOD detection, particularly in challenging scenarios with diverse and complex object instances.</p>

<p>Abstract: As object detectors are increasingly deployed as black-box cloud services or pre-trained models with restricted access to the original training data, the challenge of zero-shot object-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection arises. This task becomes crucial in ensuring the reliability of detectors in open-world settings. While existing methods have demonstrated success in image-level OOD detection using pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, directly applying such models to object-level OOD detection presents challenges due to the loss of contextual information and reliance on image-level alignment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new method that leverages visual prompts and text-augmented in-distribution (ID) space construction to adapt CLIP for zero-shot object-level OOD detection. Our method preserves critical contextual information and improves the ability to differentiate between ID and OOD objects, achieving competitive performance across different benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Before deployment in the real-world deep neural networks require thorough evaluation of how they handle both knowns, inputs represented in the training data, and unknowns (anomalies). This is especially important for scene understanding tasks with safety critical applications, such as in autonomous driving. Existing datasets allow evaluation of only knowns or unknowns - but not both, which is required to establish "in the wild" suitability of deep neural network models. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel anomaly segmentation dataset, ISSU, that features a diverse set of anomaly inputs from cluttered real-world environments. The dataset is twice larger than existing anomaly segmentation datasets, and provides a training, validation and test set for controlled in-domain evaluation. The test set consists of a static and temporal part, with the latter comprised of videos. The dataset provides annotations for both closed-set (knowns) and anomalies, enabling closed-set and open-set evaluation. The dataset covers diverse conditions, such as domain and cross-sensor shift, illumination variation and allows ablation of anomaly detection methods with respect to these variations. Evaluation results of current state-of-the-art methods confirm the need for improvements especially in domain-generalization, small and large object segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Xu, XingGuo Deng, Rui Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is a novel method for scene representation and view synthesis. Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yancong Lin, Shiming Wang, Liangliang Nan, Julian Kooij, Holger Caesar</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow estimation aims to recover per-point motion from two adjacent LiDAR scans. However, in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, points rarely move independently of others, especially for nearby points belonging to the same object, which often share the same motion. Incorporating this locally rigid motion constraint has been a key challenge in self-supervised scene flow estimation, which is often addressed by post-processing or appending extra regularization. While these approaches are able to improve the rigidity of predicted flows, they lack an architectural inductive bias for local rigidity within the model structure, leading to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior performance. In contrast, we enforce local rigidity with a lightweight add-on module in neural network design, enabling end-to-end learning. We design a discretized voting space that accommodates all possible translations and then identify the one shared by nearby points by differentiable voting. Additionally, to ensure computational efficiency, we operate on pillars rather than points and learn representative features for voting per pillar. We plug the Voting Module into popular model designs and evaluate its benefit on Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets. We outperform baseline works with only marginal compute overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiang He, Minghui Hu, Chuanxia Zheng, Chaoyue Wang, Tat-Jen Cham</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in style and appearance transfer are impressive, but most methods isolate global style and local appearance transfer, neglecting semantic correspondence. Additionally, image and video tasks are typically handled in isolation, with little focus on integrating them for video transfer. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel task, Semantic Style Transfer, which involves transferring style and appearance features from a reference image to a target visual content based on semantic correspondence. We subsequently propose a training-free method, Semantix an energy-guided sampler designed for Semantic Style Transfer that simultaneously guides both style and appearance transfer based on semantic understanding capacity of pre-trained diffusion models. Additionally, as a sampler, Semantix be seamlessly applied to both image and video models, enabling semantic style transfer to be generic across various visual media. Specifically, once inverting both reference and context images or videos to noise space by SDEs, Semantix utilizes a meticulously crafted energy function to guide the sampling process, including three key components: Style Feature Guidance, Spatial Feature Guidance and Semantic Distance as a regularisation term. Experimental results demonstrate that Semantix not only effectively accomplishes the task of semantic style transfer across images and videos, but also surpasses existing state-of-the-art solutions in both fields.

In this paper, we propose a novel CAD data annotation engine that leverages intrinsic attributes from systematically archived CAD drawings to automatically generate high-quality annotations, thus significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. Utilizing this engine, we construct ArchCAD-400K, a large-scale CAD dataset consisting of 413,062 chunks from 5538 highly standardized drawings, making it over 26 times larger than the largest existing CAD dataset. ArchCAD-400K boasts an extended drawing diversity and broader categories, offering line-grained annotations. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model for panoptic symbol spotting, termed Dual-Pathway Symbol Spotter (DPSS).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Heng Chen, Zi-Xin Zou, Chang Liu, Tianjiao Jing, Yan-Pei Cao, Shi-Sheng Huang, Hongbo Fu, Hua Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate surface reconstruction from unposed images is crucial for efficient 3D object or scene creation. However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22351">One Look is Enough: A Novel Seamless Patchwise Refinement for Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Estimation Models on High-Resolution Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeongjun Kwon, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot depth estimation (DE) models exhibit strong generalization performance as they are trained on large-scale datasets. However, existing models struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image resolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high resolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation accuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the training resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images. Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches and results in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to obtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due to the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability. To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data. Zero-shot evaluation on Booster, ETH3D, Middlebury 2014, and NuScenes demonstrates into which our PRO can be well harmonized, making their DE capabilities still effective for the grid input of high-resolution images with little depth discontinuities at the grid boundaries. Our PRO runs fast at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bar{\i}\c{s} Batuhan Topal, Umut \"Ozyurt, Zafer Do\u{g}an Budak, Ramazan Gokberk Cinbis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing high-quality images from textual prompts. However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. The code, model weights, and dataset will be released publicly upon acceptance.</p>

We present EchoFlow, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic echocardiogram images and videos.

We rigorously evaluate our synthetic datasets on the clinically relevant task of ejection fraction regression and demonstrate, for the first time, that downstream models trained exclusively on EchoFlow-generated synthetic datasets achieve performance parity with models trained on real datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Xia, Min Xu, Wenjian Huang, Jianguo Zhang, Haimin Zhang, Chunxia Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the similar structures of human faces, existing face alignment methods cannot learn unified knowledge from multiple datasets with different landmark annotations. The limited training samples in a single dataset commonly result in fragile robustness in this field. To mitigate knowledge discrepancies among different datasets and train a task-agnostic unified face alignment (TUFA) framework, this paper presents a strategy to unify knowledge from multiple datasets. Specifically, we calculate a mean face shape for each dataset. To explicitly align these mean shapes on an interpretable plane based on their semantics, each shape is then incorporated with a group of semantic alignment embeddings. The 2D coordinates of these aligned shapes can be viewed as the anchors of the plane. By encoding them into structure prompts and further regressing the corresponding facial landmarks using image features, a mapping from the plane to the target faces is finally established, which unifies the learning target of different datasets. Consequently, multiple datasets can be utilized to boost the generalization ability of the model. The successful mitigation of discrepancies also enhances the efficiency of knowledge transferring to a novel dataset, significantly boosts the performance of few-shot face alignment. Additionally, the interpretable plane endows TUFA with a task-agnostic characteristic, enabling it to locate landmarks unseen during training in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments are carried on seven benchmarks and the results demonstrate an impressive improvement in face alignment brought by knowledge discrepancies mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Force estimation in human-object interactions is crucial for various fields like ergonomics, physical therapy, and sports science. Traditional methods depend on specialized equipment such as force plates and sensors, which makes accurate assessments both expensive and restricted to laboratory settings. In this paper, we introduce ForcePose, a novel deep learning framework that estimates applied forces by combining human pose estimation with object detection. Our approach leverages MediaPipe for skeletal tracking and SSD MobileNet for object recognition to create a unified representation of human-object interaction. We've developed a specialized neural network that processes both spatial and temporal features to predict force magnitude and direction without needing any physical sensors. After training on our dataset of 850 annotated videos with corresponding force measurements, our model achieves a mean absolute error of 5.83 N in force magnitude and 7.4 degrees in force direction. When compared to existing computer vision approaches, our method performs 27.5% better while still offering real-time performance on standard computing hardware. ForcePose opens up new possibilities for force analysis in diverse real-world scenarios where traditional measurement tools are impractical or intrusive. This paper discusses our methodology, the dataset creation process, evaluation metrics, and potential applications across rehabilitation, ergonomics assessment, and athletic performance analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Steinhauser, Philipp Reis, Hubert Padusinski, Jacob Langner, Eric Sax</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise perception of the environment is essential in highly automated driving systems, which rely on machine learning tasks such as object detection and segmentation. Compression of sensor data is commonly used for data handling, while virtualization is used for hardware-in-the-loop validation. Both methods can alter sensor data and degrade model performance. This necessitates a systematic approach to quantifying image validity. This paper presents a four-step framework to evaluate the impact of image modifications on machine learning tasks. First, a dataset with modified images is prepared to ensure one-to-one matching image pairs, enabling measurement of deviations resulting from compression and virtualization. Second, image deviations are quantified by comparing the effects of compression and virtualization against original camera-based sensor data. Third, the performance of state-of-the-art object detection models is analyzed to determine how altered input data affects perception tasks, including bounding box accuracy and reliability. Finally, a correlation analysis is performed to identify relationships between image quality and model performance. As a result, the LPIPS metric achieves the highest correlation between image deviation and machine learning performance across all evaluated machine learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate tissue point tracking in endoscopic videos is critical for robotic-assisted surgical navigation and scene understanding, but remains challenging due to complex deformations, instrument occlusion, and the scarcity of dense trajectory annotations. Existing methods struggle with long-term tracking under these conditions due to limited feature utilization and annotation dependence. We present Endo-TTAP, a novel framework addressing these challenges through: (1) A Multi-Facet Guided Attention (MFGA) module that synergizes multi-scale flow dynamics, DINOv2 semantic embeddings, and explicit motion patterns to jointly predict point positions with uncertainty and occlusion awareness; (2) A two-stage curriculum learning strategy employing an Auxiliary Curriculum Adapter (ACA) for progressive initialization and hybrid supervision. Stage I utilizes synthetic data with optical flow ground truth for uncertainty-occlusion regularization, while Stage II combines unsupervised flow consistency and semi-supervised learning with refined pseudo-labels from off-the-shelf trackers. Extensive validation on two MICCAI Challenge datasets and our collected dataset demonstrates that Endo-TTAP achieves state-of-the-art performance in tissue point tracking, particularly in scenarios characterized by complex endoscopic conditions.

<p>Abstract: Gait analysis is crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring of movement disorders like Parkinson's Disease. While computer vision models have shown potential for objectively evaluating parkinsonian gait, their effectiveness is limited by scarce clinical datasets and the challenge of collecting large and well-labelled data, impacting model accuracy and risk of bias. To address these gaps, we propose GAITGen, a novel framework that generates realistic gait sequences conditioned on specified pathology severity levels. GAITGen employs a Conditional Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder to learn disentangled representations of motion dynamics and pathology-specific factors, coupled with Mask and Residual Transformers for conditioned sequence generation. GAITGen generates realistic, diverse gait sequences across severity levels, enriching datasets and enabling large-scale model training in parkinsonian gait analysis. Experiments on our new PD-GaM (real) dataset demonstrate that GAITGen outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models in both reconstruction fidelity and generation quality, accurately capturing critical pathology-specific gait features. A clinical user study confirms the realism and clinical relevance of our generated sequences. Moreover, incorporating GAITGen-generated data into downstream tasks improves parkinsonian gait severity estimation, highlighting its potential for advancing clinical gait analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are widely adopted to solve complex and challenging tasks. Especially in high-stakes decision-making, understanding their reasoning process is crucial, yet proves challenging for modern deep networks. Feature visualization (FV) is a powerful tool to decode what information neurons are responding to and hence to better understand the reasoning behind such networks. In particular, in FV we generate human-understandable images that reflect the information detected by neurons of interest. However, current methods often yield unrecognizable visualizations, exhibiting repetitive patterns and visual artifacts that are hard to understand for a human. To address these problems, we propose to guide FV through statistics of real image features combined with measures of relevant network flow to generate prototypical images. Our approach yields human-understandable visualizations that both qualitatively and quantitatively improve over state-of-the-art FVs across various architectures. As such, it can be used to decode which information the network uses, complementing mechanistic circuits that identify where it is encoded.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Jin Huang, Yuan-Ming Li, Zhi-Wei Xia, Yu-Ming Tang, Kun-Yu Lin, Jian-Fang Hu, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Error detection in procedural activities is essential for consistent and correct outcomes in AR-assisted and robotic systems. Existing methods often focus on temporal ordering errors or rely on static prototypes to represent normal actions. However, these approaches typically overlook the common scenario where multiple, distinct actions are valid following a given sequence of executed actions. This leads to two issues: (1) the model cannot effectively detect errors using static prototypes when the inference environment or action execution distribution differs from training; and (2) the model may also use the wrong prototypes to detect errors if the ongoing action label is not the same as the predicted one. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Multiple Normal Action Representation (AMNAR) framework. AMNAR predicts all valid next actions and reconstructs their corresponding normal action representations, which are compared against the ongoing action to detect errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AMNAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of AMNAR and the importance of modeling multiple valid next actions in error detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangyong Huang, Baoxiong Jia, Yan Wang, Ziyu Zhu, Xiongkun Linghu, Qing Li, Song-Chun Zhu, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing 3D vision-language (3D-VL) benchmarks fall short in evaluating 3D-VL models, creating a "mist" that obscures rigorous insights into model capabilities and 3D-VL tasks. This mist persists due to three key limitations. First, flawed test data, like ambiguous referential text in the grounding task, can yield incorrect and unreliable test results. Second, oversimplified metrics such as simply averaging accuracy per question answering (QA) pair, cannot reveal true model capability due to their vulnerability to language variations. Third, existing benchmarks isolate the grounding and QA tasks, disregarding the underlying coherence that QA should be based on solid grounding capabilities. To unveil the "mist", we propose Beacon3D, a benchmark for 3D-VL grounding and QA tasks, delivering a perspective shift in the evaluation of 3D-VL understanding. Beacon3D features (i) high-quality test data with precise and natural language, (ii) object-centric evaluation with multiple tests per object to ensure robustness, and (iii) a novel chain-of-analysis paradigm to address language robustness and model performance coherence across grounding and QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D-VL models on Beacon3D reveals that (i) object-centric evaluation elicits true model performance and particularly weak generalization in QA; (ii) grounding-QA coherence remains fragile in current 3D-VL models, and (iii) incorporating large language models (LLMs) to 3D-VL models, though as a prevalent practice, hinders grounding capabilities and has yet to elevate QA capabilities. We hope Beacon3D and our comprehensive analysis could benefit the 3D-VL community towards faithful developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Izquierdo, Mohamed Sayed, Michael Firman, Guillermo Garcia-Hernando, Daniyar Turmukhambetov, Javier Civera, Oisin Mac Aodha, Gabriel Brostow, Jamie Watson</p>
<p>Abstract: Computing accurate depth from multiple views is a fundamental and longstanding challenge in computer vision. However, most existing approaches do not generalize well across different domains and scene types (e.g. indoor vs. outdoor). Training a general-purpose multi-view stereo model is challenging and raises several questions, e.g. how to best make use of transformer-based architectures, how to incorporate additional metadata when there is a variable number of input views, and how to estimate the range of valid depths which can vary considerably across different scenes and is typically not known a priori? To address these issues, we introduce MVSA, a novel and versatile Multi-View Stereo architecture that aims to work Anywhere by generalizing across diverse domains and depth ranges. MVSA combines monocular and multi-view cues with an adaptive cost volume to deal with scale-related issues. We demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot depth estimation on the Robust Multi-View Depth Benchmark, surpassing existing multi-view stereo and monocular baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuhao Li, Huan Jin, Bin Gao, Liaoyuan Fan, Lihui Jiang, Long Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view 3D visual grounding is critical for autonomous driving vehicles to interpret natural languages and localize target objects in complex environments. However, existing datasets and methods suffer from coarse-grained language instructions, and inadequate integration of 3D geometric reasoning with linguistic comprehension. To this end, we introduce NuGrounding, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-view 3D visual grounding in autonomous driving. We present a Hierarchy of Grounding (HoG) method to construct NuGrounding to generate hierarchical multi-level instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of human instruction patterns. To tackle this challenging dataset, we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly combines instruction comprehension abilities of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) with precise localization abilities of specialist detection models. Our approach introduces two decoupled task tokens and a context query to aggregate 3D geometric information and semantic instructions, followed by a fusion decoder to refine spatial-semantic feature fusion for precise localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines adapted from representative 3D scene understanding methods by a significant margin and achieves 0.59 in precision and 0.64 in recall, with improvements of 50.8% and 54.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Wang, Shuai Zhang, Baoru Huang, Danail Stoyanov, Evangelos B. Mazomenos</p>
<p>Abstract: Complete reconstruction of surgical scenes is crucial for robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Deep depth estimation is promising but existing works struggle with depth discontinuities, resulting in noisy predictions at object boundaries and do not achieve complete reconstruction omitting occluded surfaces. To address these issues we propose EndoLRMGS, that combines Large Reconstruction Modelling (LRM) and Gaussian Splatting (GS), for complete surgical scene reconstruction. GS reconstructs deformable tissues and LRM generates 3D models for surgical tools while position and scale are subsequently optimized by introducing orthogonal perspective joint projection optimization (OPjPO) to enhance accuracy. In experiments on four surgical videos from three public datasets, our method improves the Intersection-over-union (IoU) of tool 3D models in 2D projections by>40%. Additionally, EndoLRMGS improves the PSNR of the tools projection from 3.82% to 11.07%. Tissue rendering quality also improves, with PSNR increasing from 0.46% to 49.87%, and SSIM from 1.53% to 29.21% across all test videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krispin Wandel, Hesheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic correspondence made tremendous progress through the recent advancements of large vision models (LVM). While these LVMs have been shown to reliably capture local semantics, the same can currently not be said for capturing global geometric relationships between semantic object regions. This problem leads to unreliable performance for semantic correspondence between images with extreme view variation. In this work, we aim to leverage monocular depth estimates to capture these geometric relationships for more robust and data-efficient semantic correspondence. First, we introduce a simple but effective method to build 3D object-class representations from monocular depth estimates and LVM features using a sparsely annotated image correspondence dataset. Second, we formulate an alignment energy that can be minimized using gradient descent to obtain an alignment between the 3D object-class representation and the object-class instance in the input RGB-image. Our method achieves state-of-the-art matching accuracy in multiple categories on the challenging SPair-71k dataset, increasing the PCK@0.1 score by more than 10 points on three categories and overall by 3.3 points from 85.6% to 88.9%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Ki\v{s}\v{s}, Michal Hradi\v{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful approach for leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve model performance in various domains. In this paper, we explore masked self-supervised pre-training for text recognition transformers. Specifically, we propose two modifications to the pre-training phase: progressively increasing the masking probability, and modifying the loss function to incorporate both masked and non-masked patches. We conduct extensive experiments using a dataset of 50M unlabeled text lines for pre-training and four differently sized annotated datasets for fine-tuning. Furthermore, we compare our pre-trained models against those trained with transfer learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the self-supervised pre-training. In particular, pre-training consistently improves the character error rate of models, in some cases up to 30 % relatively. It is also on par with transfer learning but without relying on extra annotated text lines.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the AnnoPage Dataset, a novel collection of 7550 pages from historical documents, primarily in Czech and German, spanning from 1485 to the present, focusing on the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The dataset is designed to support research in document layout analysis and object detection. Each page is annotated with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) representing elements of 25 categories of non-textual elements, such as images, maps, decorative elements, or charts, following the Czech Methodology of image document processing. The annotations were created by expert librarians to ensure accuracy and consistency. The dataset also incorporates pages from multiple, mainly historical, document datasets to enhance variability and maintain continuity. The dataset is divided into development and test subsets, with the test set carefully selected to maintain the category distribution. We provide baseline results using YOLO and DETR object detectors, offering a reference point for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Remy Sabathier, Niloy J. Mitra, David Novotny</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic assets from video data is central to many in computer vision and graphics tasks. Existing 4D reconstruction approaches are limited by category-specific models or slow optimization-based methods. Inspired by the recent Large Reconstruction Model (LRM), we present the Large Interpolation Model (LIM), a transformer-based feed-forward solution, guided by a novel causal consistency loss, for interpolating implicit 3D representations across time. Given implicit 3D representations at times $t_0$ and $t_1$, LIM produces a deformed shape at any continuous time $t\in[t_0,t_1]$, delivering high-quality interpolated frames in seconds. Furthermore, LIM allows explicit mesh tracking across time, producing a consistently uv-textured mesh sequence ready for integration into existing production pipelines. We also use LIM, in conjunction with a diffusion-based multiview generator, to produce dynamic 4D reconstructions from monocular videos. We evaluate LIM on various dynamic datasets, benchmarking against image-space interpolation methods (e.g., FiLM) and direct triplane linear interpolation, and demonstrate clear advantages. In summary, LIM is the first feed-forward model capable of high-speed tracked 4D asset reconstruction across diverse categories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendi Gong, Susan Francis, Eleanor Cox, Stamatios N. Sotiropoulos, Dorothee P. Auer, Guoping Qiu, Andrew P. French, Xin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation holds paramount significance in many clinical tasks. In practice, compared to large fully annotated datasets, multiple small datasets are often more accessible and organs are not labelled consistently. Normally, an individual model is trained for each of these datasets, which is not an effective way of using data for model learning. It remains challenging to train a single model that can robustly learn from several partially labelled datasets due to label conflict and data imbalance problems. We propose MO-CTranS: a single model that can overcome such problems. MO-CTranS contains a CNN-based encoder and a Transformer-based decoder, which are connected in a multi-resolution manner. Task-specific tokens are introduced in the decoder to help differentiate label discrepancies. Our method was evaluated and compared to several baseline models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions on abdominal MRI datasets that were acquired in different views (i.e. axial and coronal) and annotated for different organs (i.e. liver, kidney, spleen). Our method achieved better performance (most were statistically significant) than the compared methods. Github link: https://github.com/naisops/MO-CTranS.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel variational model for decomposing images into their respective cartoon and texture parts. Our model characterizes certain non-local features of any Bounded Variation (BV) image by its Total Symmetric Variation (TSV). We demonstrate that TSV is effective in identifying regional boundaries. Based on this property, we introduce a weighted Meyer's $G$-norm to identify texture interiors without including contour edges. For BV images with bounded TSV, we show that the proposed model admits a solution. Additionally, we design a fast algorithm based on operator-splitting to tackle the associated non-convex optimization problem. The performance of our method is validated by a series of numerical experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have transformed multimodal understanding but are often constrained by generating English responses regardless of the input language. This phenomenon has been termed as Image-induced Fidelity Loss (IFL) and stems from limited multimodal multilingual training data. To address this, we propose a continuous multilingual integration strategy that injects text-only multilingual data during visual instruction tuning, preserving the language model's original multilingual capabilities. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves linguistic fidelity across languages without degradation in visual performance. We also explore model merging, which improves language fidelity but comes at the cost of visual performance. In contrast, our core method achieves robust multilingual alignment without trade-offs, offering a scalable and effective path to mitigating IFL for global VLM adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jangho Park, Taesung Kwon, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, multi-view or 4D video generation has emerged as a significant research topic. Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sindhu B Hegde, K R Prajwal, Taein Kwon, Andrew Zisserman</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-speech gestures play a vital role in non-verbal communication. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for co-speech gesture understanding in the wild. Specifically, we propose three new tasks and benchmarks to evaluate a model's capability to comprehend gesture-text-speech associations: (i) gesture-based retrieval, (ii) gestured word spotting, and (iii) active speaker detection using gestures. We present a new approach that learns a tri-modal speech-text-video-gesture representation to solve these tasks. By leveraging a combination of global phrase contrastive loss and local gesture-word coupling loss, we demonstrate that a strong gesture representation can be learned in a weakly supervised manner from videos in the wild. Our learned representations outperform previous methods, including large vision-language models (VLMs), across all three tasks. Further analysis reveals that speech and text modalities capture distinct gesture-related signals, underscoring the advantages of learning a shared tri-modal embedding space.

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Boyang (Tony),  Yu, Yanlin Jin, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Akshat Dave, Guha Balakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic cross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruining Li, Chuanxia Zheng, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Most 3D object generators focus on aesthetic quality, often neglecting physical constraints necessary in applications. One such constraint is that the 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remains balanced under gravity. Prior approaches to generating stable 3D objects used differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test-time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models to external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO), a framework to use the feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator outputs stable 3D objects directly. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with a stability score obtained from the physics simulator. We can then fine-tune the 3D generator using the stability score as the alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO), a novel objective, which we introduce, to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either DPO or DRO objective, is much faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework works even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqi Li, Xuanyu Zhang, Shijie Zhao, Yabin Zhang, Junlin Li, Li Zhang, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) focuses on the perceptual visual quality of images, playing a crucial role in downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, compression, and generation. The rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly broadened the scope of IQA, moving toward comprehensive image quality understanding that incorporates content analysis, degradation perception, and comparison reasoning beyond mere numerical scoring. Previous MLLM-based methods typically either generate numerical scores lacking interpretability or heavily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using large-scale annotated datasets to provide descriptive assessments, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this paper, we propose Q-Insight, a reinforcement learning-based model built upon group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which demonstrates strong visual reasoning capability for image quality understanding while requiring only a limited amount of rating scores and degradation labels. By jointly optimizing score regression and degradation perception tasks with carefully designed reward functions, our approach effectively exploits their mutual benefits for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Insight substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both score regression and degradation perception tasks, while exhibiting impressive zero-shot generalization to comparison reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Tu, Hui Wang, Jiangbo Pei, Xiaojuan Yu, Aidong Men, Suxia Wang, Qingchao Chen, Ying Tan, Feng Yu, Minghui Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Renal chronicity indices (CI) have been identified as strong predictors of long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN) patients. However, assessment by pathologists is hindered by challenges such as substantial time requirements, high interobserver variation, and susceptibility to fatigue. This study aims to develop an effective deep learning (DL) pipeline that automates the assessment of CI and provides valuable prognostic insights from a disease-specific perspective. Methods: We curated a dataset comprising 282 slides obtained from 141 patients across two independent cohorts with a complete 10-years follow-up. Our DL pipeline was developed on 60 slides (22,410 patch images) from 30 patients in the training cohort and evaluated on both an internal testing set (148 slides, 77,605 patch images) and an external testing set (74 slides, 27,522 patch images). Results: The study included two cohorts with slight demographic differences, particularly in age and hemoglobin levels. The DL pipeline showed high segmentation performance across tissue compartments and histopathologic lesions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The DL pipeline also demonstrated a strong correlation with pathologists in assessing CI, significantly improving interobserver agreement. Additionally, the DL pipeline enhanced prognostic accuracy, particularly in outcome prediction, when combined with clinical parameters and pathologist-assessed CIs Conclusions: The DL pipeline demonstrated accuracy and efficiency in assessing CI in LN, showing promise in improving interobserver agreement among pathologists. It also exhibited significant value in prognostic analysis and enhancing outcome prediction in LN patients, offering a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various medical imaging tasks, such as denoising, registration, and segmentation, by representing images as continuous functions, allowing complex details to be captured. For image reconstruction problems, INRs can also reduce artifacts typically introduced by conventional reconstruction algorithms. However, to the best of our knowledge, INRs have not been studied in the context of PET reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised PET image reconstruction method based on the implicit SIREN neural network architecture using sinusoidal activation functions. Our method incorporates a forward projection model and a loss function adapted to perform PET image reconstruction directly from sinograms, without the need for large training datasets. The performance of the proposed approach was compared with that of conventional penalized likelihood methods and deep image prior (DIP) based reconstruction using brain phantom data and realistically simulated sinograms. The results show that the INR-based approach can reconstruct high-quality images with a simpler, more efficient model, offering improvements in PET image reconstruction, particularly in terms of contrast, activity recovery, and relative bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the setting of clinical imaging, differences in between vendors, hospitals and sequences can yield highly inhomogeneous imaging data. In MRI in particular, voxel dimension, slice spacing and acquisition plane can vary substantially. For clinical applications, therefore, algorithms must be trained to handle data with various voxel resolutions. The usual strategy to deal with heterogeneity of resolution is harmonization: resampling imaging data to a common (usually isovoxel) resolution. This can lead to loss of fidelity arising from interpolation artifacts out-of-plane and downsampling in-plane. We present in this paper a network architecture designed to be able to learn directly from spatially heterogeneous data, without resampling: a segmentation network based on the e3nn framework that leverages a spherical harmonic, rather than voxel-grid, parameterization of convolutional kernels, with a fixed physical radius. Networks based on these kernels can be resampled to their input voxel dimensions. We trained and tested our network on a publicly available dataset assembled from three centres, and on an in-house dataset of Multiple Sclerosis cases with a high degree of spatial inhomogeneity. We compared our approach to a standard U-Net with two strategies for handling inhomogeneous data: training directly on the data without resampling, and resampling to a common resolution of 1mm isovoxels. We show that our network is able to learn from various combinations of voxel sizes and outperforms classical U-Nets on 2D testing cases and most 3D testing cases. This shows an ability to generalize well when tested on image resolutions not seen during training. Our code can be found at: http://github.com/SCAN-NRAD/e3nn\_U-Net.</p>

<p>Abstract: Introduction: This study provides a comprehensive performance assessment of vision-language models (VLMs) against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and classic machine learning models (CMLs) for computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) of colonoscopy polyp images. Method: We analyzed 2,258 colonoscopy images with corresponding pathology reports from 428 patients. We preprocessed all images using standardized techniques (resizing, normalization, and augmentation) and implemented a rigorous comparative framework evaluating 11 distinct models: ResNet50, 4 CMLs (random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree), two specialized contrastive vision language encoders (CLIP, BiomedCLIP), and three general-purpose VLMs ( GPT-4 Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus). Our performance assessment focused on two clinical tasks: polyp detection (CADe) and classification (CADx). Result: In polyp detection, ResNet50 achieved the best performance (F1: 91.35%, AUROC: 0.98), followed by BiomedCLIP (F1: 88.68%, AUROC: [AS1] ). GPT-4 demonstrated comparable effectiveness to traditional machine learning approaches (F1: 81.02%, AUROC: [AS2] ), outperforming other general-purpose VLMs. For polyp classification, performance rankings remained consistent but with lower overall metrics. ResNet50 maintained the highest efficacy (weighted F1: 74.94%), while GPT-4 demonstrated moderate capability (weighted F1: 41.18%), significantly exceeding other VLMs (Claude-3-Opus weighted F1: 25.54%, Gemini 1.5 Pro weighted F1: 6.17%). Conclusion: CNNs remain superior for both CADx and CADe tasks. However, VLMs like BioMedCLIP and GPT-4 may be useful for polyp detection tasks where training CNNs is not feasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kailin Li, Puhao Li, Tengyu Liu, Yuyang Li, Siyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pilseo Park, Ze Zhang, Michel Sarkis, Ning Bi, Xiaoming Liu, Yiying Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of head avatars from monocular videos is highly desirable for virtual human applications, but it remains a challenge in the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. In this paper, we propose a two-phase head avatar reconstruction network that incorporates a refined 3D mesh representation. Our approach, in contrast to existing methods that rely on coarse template-based 3D representations derived from 3DMM, aims to learn a refined mesh representation suitable for a NeRF that captures complex facial nuances. In the first phase, we train 3DMM-stored NeRF with an initial mesh to utilize geometric priors and integrate observations across frames using a consistent set of latent codes. In the second phase, we leverage a novel mesh refinement procedure based on an SDF constructed from the density field of the initial NeRF. To mitigate the typical noise in the NeRF density field without compromising the features of the 3DMM, we employ Laplace smoothing on the displacement field. Subsequently, we apply a second-phase training with these refined meshes, directing the learning process of the network towards capturing intricate facial details. Our experiments demonstrate that our method further enhances the NeRF rendering based on the initial mesh and achieves performance superior to state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing high-fidelity head avatars with such input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Seiffarth, Katharina N\"oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking individual cells in live-cell imaging provides fundamental insights, inevitable for studying causes and consequences of phenotypic heterogeneity, responses to changing environmental conditions or stressors. Microbial cell tracking, characterized by stochastic cell movements and frequent cell divisions, remains a challenging task when imaging frame rates must be limited to avoid counterfactual results. A promising way to overcome this limitation is uncertainty-aware tracking (UAT), which uses statistical models, calibrated to empirically observed cell behavior, to predict likely cell associations. We present PyUAT, an efficient and modular Python implementation of UAT for tracking microbial cells in time-lapse imaging. We demonstrate its performance on a large 2D+t data set and investigate the influence of modular biological models and imaging intervals on the tracking performance. The open-source PyUAT software is available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/PyUAT, including example notebooks for immediate use in Google Colab.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishit Mehta, Manmohan Chandraker, Ravi Ramamoorthi</p>
<p>Abstract: Problems in differentiable rendering often involve optimizing scene parameters that cause motion in image space. The gradients for such parameters tend to be sparse, leading to poor convergence. While existing methods address this sparsity through proxy gradients such as topological derivatives or lagrangian derivatives, they make simplifying assumptions about rendering. Multi-resolution image pyramids offer an alternative approach but prove unreliable in practice. We introduce a method that uses locally orderless images, where each pixel maps to a histogram of intensities that preserves local variations in appearance. Using an inverse rendering objective that minimizes histogram distance, our method extends support for sparsely defined image gradients and recovers optimal parameters. We validate our method on various inverse problems using both synthetic and real data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivation: Lack of tools for comprehensive and complete segmentation of deep grey nuclei using a single software for reproducibility and repeatability Goal(s): A fast accurate and robust method for segmentation of deep grey nuclei (thalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, claustrum, red nucleus) from structural T1 MRI data at conventional field strengths Approach: We leverage the improved contrast of white-matter-nulled imaging by using the recently proposed Histogram-based Polynomial Synthesis (HIPS) to synthesize WMn-like images from standard T1 and then use a multi-atlas segmentation with joint label fusion to segment deep grey nuclei. Results: The method worked robustly on all field strengths (1.5/3/7) and Dice coefficients of 0.7 or more were achieved for all structures compared against manual segmentation ground truth. Impact: This method facilitates careful investigation of the role of deep grey nuclei by enabling the use of conventional T1 data from large public databases, which has not been possible, hitherto, due to lack of robust reproducible segmentation tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Lesniewski</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimizing real-valued objective functions defined on the Grassmann manifold Gr}(k,n), the space of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of R^n. While existing optimization techniques on Gr}(k,n) predominantly rely on first- or second-order Riemannian methods, these inherently local methods often struggle with nonconvex or multimodal landscapes. To address this limitation, we adapt the Differential Evolution algorithm - a global, population based optimization method - to operate effectively on the Grassmannian. Our approach incorporates adaptive control parameter schemes, and introduces a projection mechanism that maps trial vectors onto the manifold via QR decomposition. The resulting algorithm maintains feasibility with respect to the manifold structure while enabling exploration beyond local neighborhoods. This framework provides a flexible and geometry-aware alternative to classical Riemannian optimization methods and is well-suited to applications in machine learning, signal processing, and low-rank matrix recovery where subspace representations play a central role. We test the methodology on a number of examples of optimization problems on Grassmann manifolds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Zafari, Xi Chen, Shirin Jalali</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based denoising algorithms achieve state-of-the-art performance across various denoising tasks. However, training such models relies on access to large training datasets consisting of clean and noisy image pairs. On the other hand, in many imaging applications, such as microscopy, collecting ground truth images is often infeasible. To address this challenge, researchers have recently developed algorithms that can be trained without requiring access to ground truth data. However, training such models remains computationally challenging and still requires access to large noisy training samples. In this work, inspired by compression-based denoising and recent advances in neural compression, we propose a new compression-based denoising algorithm, which we name DeCompress, that i) does not require access to ground truth images, ii) does not require access to large training dataset - only a single noisy image is sufficient, iii) is robust to overfitting, and iv) achieves superior performance compared with zero-shot or unsupervised learning-based denoisers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mammography stands as the main screening method for detecting breast cancer early, enhancing treatment success rates. The segmentation of landmark structures in mammography images can aid the medical assessment in the evaluation of cancer risk and the image acquisition adequacy. We introduce a series of data-centric strategies aimed at enriching the training data for deep learning-based segmentation of landmark structures. Our approach involves augmenting the training samples through annotation-guided image intensity manipulation and style transfer to achieve better generalization than standard training procedures. These augmentations are applied in a balanced manner to ensure the model learns to process a diverse range of images generated by different vendor equipments while retaining its efficacy on the original data. We present extensive numerical and visual results that demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our methods when compared to the standard training. For this evaluation, we consider a large dataset that includes mammography images generated by different vendor equipments. Further, we present complementary results that show both the strengths and limitations of our methods across various scenarios. The accuracy and robustness demonstrated in the experiments suggest that our method is well-suited for integration into clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Puzhen Yuan, Angyuan Ma, Yunchao Yao, Huaxiu Yao, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Mingyu Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic planning, particularly for long-horizon tasks that require a holistic understanding of the environment for task decomposition. Existing methods typically rely on prior environmental knowledge or carefully designed task-specific prompts, making them struggle with dynamic scene changes or unexpected task conditions, e.g., a robot attempting to put a carrot in the microwave but finds the door was closed. Such challenges underscore two critical issues: adaptability and efficiency. To address them, in this work, we propose an adaptive multi-agent planning framework, termed REMAC, that enables efficient, scene-agnostic multi-robot long-horizon task planning and execution through continuous reflection and self-evolution. REMAC incorporates two key modules: a self-reflection module performing pre-condition and post-condition checks in the loop to evaluate progress and refine plans, and a self-evolvement module dynamically adapting plans based on scene-specific reasoning. It offers several appealing benefits: 1) Robots can initially explore and reason about the environment without complex prompt design. 2) Robots can keep reflecting on potential planning errors and adapting the plan based on task-specific insights. 3) After iterations, a robot can call another one to coordinate tasks in parallel, maximizing the task execution efficiency. To validate REMAC's effectiveness, we build a multi-agent environment for long-horizon robot manipulation and navigation based on RoboCasa, featuring 4 task categories with 27 task styles and 50+ different objects. Based on it, we further benchmark state-of-the-art reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini, QwQ, and Grok3, demonstrating REMAC's superiority by boosting average success rates by 40% and execution efficiency by 52.7% over the single robot baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changchang Sun, Gaowen Liu, Charles Fleming, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have gained increasing attention since their impressive results for cross-modal synthesis, where the strong alignment between conditioning input and generated output can be achieved by training a time-conditioned U-Net augmented with cross-attention mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the problem of generating music synchronized with rhythmic visual cues of the given dance video. Considering that bi-directional guidance is more beneficial for training a diffusion model, we propose to enhance the quality of generated music and its synchronization with dance videos by adopting both positive rhythmic information and negative ones (PN-Diffusion) as conditions, where a dual diffusion and reverse processes is devised. Specifically, to train a sequential multi-modal U-Net structure, PN-Diffusion consists of a noise prediction objective for positive conditioning and an additional noise prediction objective for negative conditioning. To accurately define and select both positive and negative conditioning, we ingeniously utilize temporal correlations in dance videos, capturing positive and negative rhythmic cues by playing them forward and backward, respectively. Through subjective and objective evaluations of input-output correspondence in terms of dance-music beat alignment and the quality of generated music, experimental results on the AIST++ and TikTok dance video datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA dance-to-music generation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Cai, Xiaojun Yuan, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Message passing algorithms have been tailored for compressive imaging applications by plugging in different types of off-the-shelf image denoisers. These off-the-shelf denoisers mostly rely on some generic or hand-crafted priors for denoising. Due to their insufficient accuracy in capturing the true image prior, these methods often fail to produce satisfactory results, especially in largely underdetermined scenarios. On the other hand, score-based generative modeling offers a promising way to accurately characterize the sophisticated image distribution. In this paper, by exploiting the close relation between score-based modeling and empirical Bayes-optimal denoising, we devise a message passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. This framework is firmly rooted in Bayesian formalism, in which state evolution (SE) equations accurately predict its asymptotic performance. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that our method strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff than conventional message passing, regularized linear regression, and score-based posterior sampling baselines. Remarkably, our method typically requires less than 20 neural function evaluations (NFEs) to converge.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a UNet-based foundation model and its self-supervised learning method to address two key challenges: 1) lack of qualified annotated analog layout data, and 2) excessive variety in analog layout design tasks. For self-supervised learning, we propose random patch sampling and random masking techniques automatically to obtain enough training data from a small unannotated layout dataset. The obtained data are greatly augmented, less biased, equally sized, and contain enough information for excessive varieties of qualified layout patterns. By pre-training with the obtained data, the proposed foundation model can learn implicit general knowledge on layout patterns so that it can be fine-tuned for various downstream layout tasks with small task-specific datasets. Fine-tuning provides an efficient and consolidated methodology for diverse downstream tasks, reducing the enormous human effort to develop a model per task separately. In experiments, the foundation model was pre-trained using 324,000 samples obtained from 6 silicon-proved manually designed analog circuits, then it was fine-tuned for the five example downstream tasks: generating contacts, vias, dummy fingers, N-wells, and metal routings. The fine-tuned models successfully performed these tasks for more than one thousand unseen layout inputs, generating DRC/LVS-clean layouts for 96.6% of samples. Compared with training the model from scratch for the metal routing task, fine-tuning required only 1/8 of the data to achieve the same dice score of 0.95. With the same data, fine-tuning achieved a 90% lower validation loss and a 40% higher benchmark score than training from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Feng, Hao Sun, Wei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel-view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes from 2D images presents significant challenges due to the spatial complexity and temporal variability of such scenes. Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.</p>

The dataset ensured diversity in demographics, imaging equipment, and clinical settings. Rigorous annotation and preprocessing yielded high-quality training datasets for pathology-specific models like ResNet15 for joint space narrowing and DenseNet for osteoarthritis grading.
  Performance: The AI system achieved strong diagnostic accuracy across diverse imaging environments. Pathology-specific models excelled in precision, recall, and NPV, validated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient. Subgroup analyses across age, gender, and manufacturer variations confirmed generalizability for real-world applications.

<p>Abstract: Accurate and reliable selection of the appropriate acetabular cup size is crucial for restoring joint biomechanics in total hip arthroplasty (THA). This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates square-root velocity function (SRVF)-based elastic shape registration technique with an embedded deformation (ED) graph approach to reconstruct the 3D articular surface of the acetabulum by fusing multiple views of 2D pre-operative pelvic X-ray images and a hemispherical surface model. The SRVF-based elastic registration establishes 2D-3D correspondences between the parametric hemispherical model and X-ray images, and the ED framework incorporates the SRVF-derived correspondences as constraints to optimize the 3D acetabular surface reconstruction using nonlinear least-squares optimization. Validations using both simulation and real patient datasets are performed to demonstrate the robustness and the potential clinical value of the proposed algorithm. The reconstruction result can assist surgeons in selecting the correct acetabular cup on the first attempt in primary THA, minimising the need for revision surgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanhyuk Lee, Jiho Choi, Chanryeol Lee, Donggyun Kim, Seunghoon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for unifying independently fine-tuned models into an integrated framework, significantly enhancing computational efficiency in multi-task learning. Recently, several SVD-based techniques have been introduced to exploit low-rank structures for enhanced merging, but their reliance on such manually designed rank selection often leads to cross-task interference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose AdaRank, a novel model merging framework that adaptively selects the most beneficial singular directions of task vectors to merge multiple models. We empirically show that the dominant singular components of task vectors can cause critical interference with other tasks, and that naive truncation across tasks and layers degrades performance. In contrast, AdaRank dynamically prunes the singular components that cause interference and offers an optimal amount of information to each task vector by learning to prune ranks during test-time via entropy minimization. Our analysis demonstrates that such method mitigates detrimental overlaps among tasks, while empirical results show that AdaRank consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with various backbones and number of tasks, reducing the performance gap between fine-tuned models to nearly 1%.</p>

<p>Abstract: E-commerce has revolutionized retail, yet its traditional workflows remain inefficient, with significant time and resource costs tied to product design and manufacturing inventory. This paper introduces a novel system deployed at Alibaba that leverages AI-generated items (AIGI) to address these challenges with personalized text-to-image generation for e-commercial product design. AIGI enables an innovative business mode called "sell it before you make it", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions. Only when the items have received a certain number of orders, do the merchants start to produce them, which largely reduces reliance on physical prototypes and thus accelerates time to market. For such a promising application, we identify the underlying key scientific challenge, i.e., capturing the users' group-level personalized preferences towards multiple generated candidate images. To this end, we propose a Personalized Group-Level Preference Alignment Framework for Diffusion Models (i.e., PerFusion). We first design PerFusion Reward Model for user preference estimation with a feature-crossing-based personalized plug-in. Then we develop PerFusion with a personalized adaptive network to model diverse preferences across users, and meanwhile derive the group-level preference optimization objective to capture the comparative behaviors among multiple candidates. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The AI-generated items have achieved over 13% relative improvements for both click-through rate and conversion rate compared to their human-designed counterparts, validating the revolutionary potential of AI-generated items for e-commercial platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Zhang, Sizhe Shan, Haoyu Wang, Zihao Chen, Xiulong Liu, Chaofan Ding, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating high-quality sound effects from videos and text prompts requires precise alignment between visual and audio domains, both semantically and temporally, along with step-by-step guidance for professional audio generation. However, current state-of-the-art video-guided audio generation models often fall short of producing high-quality audio for both general and specialized use cases. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-stage, multi-modal, end-to-end generative framework with Chain-of-Thought-like (CoT-like) guidance learning, termed Chain-of-Perform (CoP). First, we employ a transformer-based network architecture designed to achieve CoP guidance, enabling the generation of both general and professional audio. Second, we implement a multi-stage training framework that follows step-by-step guidance to ensure the generation of high-quality sound effects. Third, we develop a CoP multi-modal dataset, guided by video, to support step-by-step sound effects generation. Evaluation results highlight the advantages of the proposed multi-stage CoP generative framework compared to the state-of-the-art models on a variety of datasets, with FAD 0.79 to 0.74 (+6.33%), CLIP 16.12 to 17.70 (+9.80%) on VGGSound, SI-SDR 1.98dB to 3.35dB (+69.19%), MOS 2.94 to 3.49(+18.71%) on PianoYT-2h, and SI-SDR 2.22dB to 3.21dB (+44.59%), MOS 3.07 to 3.42 (+11.40%) on Piano-10h.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> YangTian Yan, Jinyu Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), which are instance agnostic perturbations that can deceive a target model across a wide range of samples. Unlike instance-specific adversarial examples, UAPs present a greater challenge as they must generalize across different samples and models. Generating UAPs typically requires access to numerous examples, which is a strong assumption in real-world tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free method called Intrinsic UAP (IntriUAP), by exploiting the intrinsic vulnerabilities of deep models. We analyze a series of popular deep models composed of linear and nonlinear layers with a Lipschitz constant of 1, revealing that the vulnerability of these models is predominantly influenced by their linear components. Based on this observation, we leverage the ill-conditioned nature of the linear components by aligning the UAP with the right singular vectors corresponding to the maximum singular value of each linear layer. Remarkably, our method achieves highly competitive performance in attacking popular image classification deep models without using any image samples. We also evaluate the black-box attack performance of our method, showing that it matches the state-of-the-art baseline for data-free methods on models that conform to our theoretical framework. Beyond the data-free assumption, IntriUAP also operates under a weaker assumption, where the adversary only can access a few of the victim model's layers. Experiments demonstrate that the attack success rate decreases by only 4% when the adversary has access to just 50% of the linear layers in the victim model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunming Liang, Zihao Chen, Chaofan Ding, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, high-quality, synchronized audio is synthesized from video and optional text inputs using various multi-modal joint learning frameworks. However, the precise alignment between the visual and generated audio domains remains far from satisfactory. One key factor is the lack of sufficient temporal and semantic alignment annotations in open-source video-audio and text-audio benchmarks. Therefore, we propose a framework for audio generation from videos, leveraging the internal chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to enable step-by-step reasoning without requiring additional annotations. Additionally, a corresponding multi-modal reasoning dataset is constructed to facilitate the learning of initial reasoning in audio generation. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing misalignment (voice-over) in generated audio and achieving competitive performance compared to various state-of-the-art models. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics. Specifically, the F DP aSST indicator is reduced by up to 10.07%, the F DP AN N s indicator by up to 11.62%, and the F DV GG indicator by up to 38.61%. Furthermore, the IS indicator improves by up to 4.95%, the IB-score indicator increases by up to 6.39%, and the DeSync indicator is reduced by up to 0.89%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Ye, Yushuang Wu, Ziteng Lu, Jiahao Chang, Xiaoyang Guo, Jiaqing Zhou, Hao Zhao, Xiaoguang Han</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing demand for high-fidelity 3D models from 2D images, existing methods still face significant challenges in accurately reproducing fine-grained geometric details due to limitations in domain gaps and inherent ambiguities in RGB images. To address these issues, we propose Hi3DGen, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images via normal bridging. Hi3DGen consists of three key components: (1) an image-to-normal estimator that decouples the low-high frequency image pattern with noise injection and dual-stream training to achieve generalizable, stable, and sharp estimation; (2) a normal-to-geometry learning approach that uses normal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry generation fidelity; and (3) a 3D data synthesis pipeline that constructs a high-quality dataset to support training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in generating rich geometric details, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity. Our work provides a new direction for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation from images by leveraging normal maps as an intermediate representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongping Liao, Xitong Gao, Yabo Xu, Chengzhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy and data security has driven the adoption of federated learning, a decentralized approach to train machine learning models without sharing raw data. Prompt learning, which fine-tunes prompt embeddings of pretrained models, offers significant advantages in federated settings by reducing computational costs and communication overheads while leveraging the strong performance and generalization capabilities of vision-language models such as CLIP. This paper addresses the intersection of federated learning and prompt learning, particularly for vision-language models. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework, named FLIP, to evaluate federated prompt learning algorithms. FLIP assesses the performance of 8 state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods across 4 federated learning protocols and 12 open datasets, considering 6 distinct evaluation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that prompt learning maintains strong generalization performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings with minimal resource consumption. This work highlights the effectiveness of federated prompt learning in environments characterized by data scarcity, unseen classes, and cross-domain distributional shifts. We open-source the code for all implemented algorithms in FLIP to facilitate further research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omini Rathore, Richard Paul, Abigail Morrison, Hanno Scharr, Elisabeth Pfaehler</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain vessel segmentation of MR scans is a critical step in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the fine vessel structure, manual vessel segmentation is time consuming. Therefore, automatic deep learning (DL) based segmentation techniques are intensively investigated. As conventional DL models yield a high complexity and lack an indication of decision reliability, they are often considered as not trustworthy. This work aims to increase trust in DL based models by incorporating epistemic uncertainty quantification into cerebrovascular segmentation models for the first time. By implementing an efficient ensemble model combining the advantages of Bayesian Approximation and Deep Ensembles, we aim to overcome the high computational costs of conventional probabilistic networks. Areas of high model uncertainty and erroneous predictions are aligned which demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the approach. We perform extensive experiments applying the ensemble model on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We demonstrate that for OOD-images, the estimated uncertainty increases. Additionally, omitting highly uncertain areas improves the segmentation quality, both for in- and out-of-distribution data. The ensemble model explains its limitations in a reliable manner and can maintain trustworthiness also for OOD data and could be considered in clinical applications</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziping Dong, Chao Shuai, Zhongjie Ba, Peng Cheng, Zhan Qin, Qinglong Wang, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Invisible watermarking is critical for content provenance and accountability in Generative AI. Although commercial companies have increasingly committed to using watermarks, the robustness of existing watermarking schemes against forgery attacks is understudied. This paper proposes DiffForge, the first watermark forgery framework capable of forging imperceptible watermarks under a no-box setting. We estimate the watermark distribution using an unconditional diffusion model and introduce shallow inversion to inject the watermark into a non-watermarked image seamlessly. This approach facilitates watermark injection while preserving image quality by adaptively selecting the depth of inversion steps, leveraging our key insight that watermarks degrade with added noise during the early diffusion phases. Comprehensive evaluations show that DiffForge deceives open-source watermark detectors with a 96.38% success rate and misleads a commercial watermark system with over 97% success rate, achieving high confidence.1 This work reveals fundamental security limitations in current watermarking paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Rowe, Roger Girgis, Anthony Gosselin, Liam Paull, Christopher Pal, Felix Heide</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Scenario Dreamer, a fully data-driven generative simulator for autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene - comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes - and closed-loop agent behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting, enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments, especially on long and adversarial driving environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raman Dutt, Harleen Hanspal, Guoxuan Xia, Petru-Daniel Tudosiu, Alexander Black, Yongxin Yang, Steven McDonagh, Sarah Parisot</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we undertake the challenge of augmenting the existing generative capabilities of pre-trained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multi-modal generation capability while satisfying two core constraints: C1 preserving the preservation of original language generative capabilities with negligible performance degradation, and C2 adhering to a small parameter budget to learn the new modality, ensuring scalability and efficiency. In contrast to current approaches that add dedicated modules, thereby significantly increasing the parameter count, we propose a method that leverages the underutilized capacity inherent in deep models. Specifically, we exploit the parameter redundancy within Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) as a source of additional capacity for learning a new modality, enabling better parameter efficiency (C1). Moreover, we preserve the original language generation capabilities by applying low-rank adaptation exclusively to the tokens of the new modality (C2). Furthermore, we introduce a novel parameter initialization scheme based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance to improve convergence and training stability. Through an extensive analysis of the routing mechanism, we uncover the emergence of modality-specific pathways and decreased redundancy within the experts that can efficiently unlock multi-modal generative capabilities. Overall, our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of contemporary LLMs, providing a new pathway for transitioning from uni-modal to multi-modal architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qisheng He, Nicholas Summerfield, Peiyong Wang, Carri Glide-Hurst, Ming Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that diffusion models produce superior synthetic images when compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, their outputs are often non-deterministic and lack high fidelity to the ground truth due to the inherent randomness. In this paper, we propose a novel High-fidelity Brownian bridge model (HiFi-BBrg) for deterministic medical image translations. Our model comprises two distinct yet mutually beneficial mappings: a generation mapping and a reconstruction mapping. The Brownian bridge training process is guided by the fidelity loss and adversarial training in the reconstruction mapping. This ensures that translated images can be accurately reversed to their original forms, thereby achieving consistent translations with high fidelity to the ground truth. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets show HiFi-BBrg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal image translation and multi-image super-resolution.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Diffusion Models have become the new state-of-the-art in deep generative modeling, ending the long-time dominance of Generative Adversarial Networks. Inspired by the Regularization by Denoising principle, we introduce an approach that integrates a Latent Diffusion Model, trained for the denoising task, into a variational framework using Half-Quadratic Splitting, exploiting its regularization properties. This approach, under appropriate conditions that can be easily met in various imaging applications, allows for reduced computational cost while achieving high-quality results. The proposed strategy, called Regularization by Latent Denoising (RELD), is then tested on a dataset of natural images, for image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks. The numerical experiments show that RELD is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly achieving remarkable results when evaluated using perceptual quality metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual observation of objects is essential for many robotic applications, such as object reconstruction and manipulation, navigation, and scene understanding. Machine learning algorithms constitute the state-of-the-art in many fields but require vast data sets, which are costly and time-intensive to collect. Automated strategies for observation and exploration are crucial to enhance the efficiency of data gathering. Therefore, a novel strategy utilizing the Next-Best-Trajectory principle is developed for a robot manipulator operating in dynamic environments. Local trajectories are generated to maximize the information gained from observations along the path while avoiding collisions. We employ a voxel map for environment modeling and utilize raycasting from perspectives around a point of interest to estimate the information gain. A global ergodic trajectory planner provides an optional reference trajectory to the local planner, improving exploration and helping to avoid local minima. To enhance computational efficiency, raycasting for estimating the information gain in the environment is executed in parallel on the graphics processing unit. Benchmark results confirm the efficiency of the parallelization, while real-world experiments demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format. The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing, transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the 9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive. We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential elections.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Boucher, Nicholas Tetlow, Annie Fung, Amy Dewar, Pietro Arina, Sven Kerneis, John Whittle, Evangelos B. Mazomenos</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: The distribution of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in cystectomy patients is indicative of the incidence of post-operative complications. Existing VAT segmentation methods for computed tomography (CT) employing intensity thresholding have limitations relating to inter-observer variability. Moreover, the difficulty in creating ground-truth masks limits the development of deep learning (DL) models for this task. This paper introduces a novel method for VAT prediction in pre-cystectomy CT, which is fully automated and does not require ground-truth VAT masks for training, overcoming aforementioned limitations. Methods: We introduce the Kernel density Enhanced VAT Segmentator ( KEVS), combining a DL semantic segmentation model, for multi-body feature prediction, with Gaussian kernel density estimation analysis of predicted subcutaneous adipose tissue to achieve accurate scan-specific predictions of VAT in the abdominal cavity. Uniquely for a DL pipeline, KEVS does not require ground-truth VAT masks. Results: We verify the ability of KEVS to accurately segment abdominal organs in unseen CT data and compare KEVS VAT segmentation predictions to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in a dataset of 20 pre-cystectomy CT scans, collected from University College London Hospital (UCLH-Cyst), with expert ground-truth annotations. KEVS presents a 4.80% and 6.02% improvement in Dice Coefficient over the second best DL and thresholding-based VAT segmentation techniques respectively when evaluated on UCLH-Cyst. Conclusion: This research introduces KEVS; an automated, SOTA method for the prediction of VAT in pre-cystectomy CT which eliminates inter-observer variability and is trained entirely on open-source CT datasets which do not contain ground-truth VAT masks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Talking head synthesis has become a key research area in computer graphics and multimedia, yet most existing methods often struggle to balance generation quality with computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) based Gaussian Splatting for high-quality and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, 4D volume representation is needed. However, directly storing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high cost and lack of scalability for longer durations. We overcome this challenge with the proposed Audio-Plane, where the 4D volume representation is decomposed into audio-independent space planes and audio-dependent planes. This provides a compact and interpretable feature representation for talking head, facilitating more precise audio-aware spatial encoding and enhanced audio-driven lip dynamic modeling. To further improve speech dynamics, we develop a dynamic splatting method that helps the network more effectively focus on modeling the dynamics of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating these innovations with the powerful Gaussian Splatting, our method is capable of synthesizing highly realistic talking videos in real time while ensuring precise audio-lip synchronization.

<p>Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) typically requires large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs, but collecting or synthesizing such data is costly. In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the question: can high-quality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from text? To tackle this, we propose a cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data synthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we construct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse caption seeds using large language models (LLMs). In Stage 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into multi-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions representations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in diverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to construct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instruction-tuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the dependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our framework offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.

<p>Abstract: Super-resolution, in-painting, whole-image generation, unpaired style-transfer, and network-constrained image reconstruction each include an aspect of machine-learned image synthesis where the actual ground truth is not known at time of use. It is generally difficult to quantitatively and authoritatively evaluate the quality of synthetic images; however, in mission-critical biomedical scenarios robust evaluation is paramount. In this work, all practical image-to-image comparisons really are relative qualifications, not absolute difference quantifications; and, therefore, meaningful evaluation of generated image quality can be accomplished using the Tversky Index, which is a well-established measure for assessing perceptual similarity. This evaluation procedure is developed and then demonstrated using multiple image data sets, both real and simulated. The main result is that when the subjectivity and intrinsic deficiencies of any feature-encoding choice are put upfront, Tversky's method leads to intuitive results, whereas traditional methods based on summarizing distances in deep feature spaces do not.</p>

In both folds, the computational and energy costs in training and inference are notable due to the often desired large input resolutions and heavy computational burden of segmentation models. To this end, we propose DANCE, general automated DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient segmentation model training and inference. Distinct from existing efficient segmentation approaches that focus merely on light-weight network design, DANCE distinguishes itself as an automated simultaneous data-network co-optimization via both input data manipulation and network architecture slimming. Specifically, DANCE integrates automated data slimming which adaptively downsamples/drops input images and controls their corresponding contribution to the training loss guided by the images' spatial complexity. Such a downsampling operation, in addition to slimming down the cost associated with the input size directly, also shrinks the dynamic range of input object and context scales, therefore motivating us to also adaptively slim the network to match the downsampled data. Extensive experiments and ablating studies (on four SOTA segmentation models with three popular segmentation datasets under two training settings) demonstrate that DANCE can achieve "all-win" towards efficient segmentation(reduced training cost, less expensive inference, and better mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU)).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bichen Wu, Chaojian Li, Hang Zhang, Xiaoliang Dai, Peizhao Zhang, Matthew Yu, Jialiang Wang, Yingyan Celine Lin, Peter Vajda</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design accurate and efficient image classification models. However, applying NAS to a new computer vision task still requires a huge amount of effort. This is because 1) previous NAS research has been over-prioritized on image classification while largely ignoring other tasks; 2) many NAS works focus on optimizing task-specific components that cannot be favorably transferred to other tasks; and 3) existing NAS methods are typically designed to be "proxyless" and require significant effort to be integrated with each new task's training pipelines. To tackle these challenges, we propose FBNetV5, a NAS framework that can search for neural architectures for a variety of vision tasks with much reduced computational cost and human effort. Specifically, we design 1) a search space that is simple yet inclusive and transferable; 2) a multitask search process that is disentangled with target tasks' training pipeline; and 3) an algorithm to simultaneously search for architectures for multiple tasks with a computational cost agnostic to the number of tasks. We evaluate the proposed FBNetV5 targeting three fundamental vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Models searched by FBNetV5 in a single run of search have outperformed the previous stateof-the-art in all the three tasks: image classification (e.g., +1.3% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under the same FLOPs as compared to FBNetV3), semantic segmentation (e.g., +1.8% higher ADE20K val. mIoU than SegFormer with 3.6x fewer FLOPs), and object detection (e.g., +1.1% COCO val. mAP with 1.2x fewer FLOPs as compared to YOLOX).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsuan-Cheng Liao, Chih-Hong Cheng, Hasan Esen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the safety-oriented performance of 3D object detectors in autonomous driving contexts. Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a method that accelerates reconstruction of 3D scenes and objects, aiming to enable instant reconstruction on edge devices such as mobile phones and AR/VR headsets. While recent works have accelerated scene reconstruction training to minute/second-level on high-end GPUs, there is still a large gap to the goal of instant training on edge devices which is yet highly desired in many emerging applications such as immersive AR/VR. To this end, this work aims to further accelerate training by leveraging geometry priors of the target scene. Our method proposes strategies to alleviate the noise of the imperfect geometry priors to accelerate the training speed on top of the highly optimized Instant-NGP. On the NeRF Synthetic dataset, our work uses half of the training iterations to reach an average test PSNR of >30.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaojian Li, Bichen Wu, Peter Vajda, Yingyan Celine Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has emerged as a leading technique for novel view synthesis, owing to its impressive photorealistic reconstruction and rendering capability. Nevertheless, achieving real-time NeRF rendering in large-scale scenes has presented challenges, often leading to the adoption of either intricate baked mesh representations with a substantial number of triangles or resource-intensive ray marching in baked representations. We challenge these conventions, observing that high-quality geometry, represented by meshes with substantial triangles, is not necessary for achieving photorealistic rendering quality. Consequently, we propose MixRT, a novel NeRF representation that includes a low-quality mesh, a view-dependent displacement map, and a compressed NeRF model. This design effectively harnesses the capabilities of existing graphics hardware, thus enabling real-time NeRF rendering on edge devices. Leveraging a highly-optimized WebGL-based rendering framework, our proposed MixRT attains real-time rendering speeds on edge devices (over 30 FPS at a resolution of 1280 x 720 on a MacBook M1 Pro laptop), better rendering quality (0.2 PSNR higher in indoor scenes of the Unbounded-360 datasets), and a smaller storage size (less than 80% compared to state-of-the-art methods).</p>

<p>Abstract: The social media-fuelled explosion of fake news and misinformation supported by tampered images has led to growth in the development of models and datasets for image manipulation detection. However, existing detection methods mostly treat media objects in isolation, without considering the impact of specific manipulations on viewer perception. Forensic datasets are usually analyzed based on the manipulation operations and corresponding pixel-based masks, but not on the semantics of the manipulation, i.e., type of scene, objects, and viewers' attention to scene content. The semantics of the manipulation play an important role in spreading misinformation through manipulated images. In an attempt to encourage further development of semantic-aware forensic approaches to understand visual misinformation, we propose a framework to analyze the trends of visual and semantic saliency in popular image manipulation datasets and their impact on detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Liu, Aditya Singh, Yijiang Li, Haohan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models, particularly in the realm of vision transformers (ViTs), is crucial for their real-world deployment. In this work, we provide a finetuning approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers inspired by the concept of nullspace from linear algebra. Our investigation centers on whether a vision transformer can exhibit resilience to input variations akin to the nullspace property in linear mappings, which would imply that perturbations sampled from this nullspace do not influence the model's output when added to the input. We start from the observation that many existing ViTs satisfy this property because their patch embedding layer has a non-trivial nullspace. Then, we extend the notion of nullspace to nonlinear settings and demonstrate that it is possible to synthesize approximate nullspace elements for ViT's encoder blocks through optimization. Finally, we propose a finetuning strategy for ViTs wherein we augment the training data with synthesized approximate nullspace noise. We find that our finetuning approach significantly improves the models' robustness to both adversarial and natural image perturbations.\footnote{Code is available at: https://github.com/Liu-Hy/ns-vit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongwei Ren, Yue Zhou, Jiadong Zhu, Haotian Fu, Yulong Huang, Xiaopeng Lin, Yuetong Fang, Fei Ma, Hao Yu, Bojun Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras draw inspiration from biological systems, boasting low latency and high dynamic range while consuming minimal power. The most current approach to processing Event Cloud often involves converting it into frame-based representations, which neglects the sparsity of events, loses fine-grained temporal information, and increases the computational burden. In contrast, Point Cloud is a popular representation for processing 3-dimensional data and serves as an alternative method to exploit local and global spatial features. Nevertheless, previous point-based methods show an unsatisfactory performance compared to the frame-based method in dealing with spatio-temporal event streams. In order to bridge the gap, we propose EventMamba, an efficient and effective framework based on Point Cloud representation by rethinking the distinction between Event Cloud and Point Cloud, emphasizing vital temporal information. The Event Cloud is subsequently fed into a hierarchical structure with staged modules to process both implicit and explicit temporal features. Specifically, we redesign the global extractor to enhance explicit temporal extraction among a long sequence of events with temporal aggregation and State Space Model (SSM) based Mamba. Our model consumes minimal computational resources in the experiments and still exhibits SOTA point-based performance on six different scales of action recognition datasets. It even outperformed all frame-based methods on both Camera Pose Relocalization (CPR) and eye-tracking regression tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rhwxmx/EventMamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Li, Qianshan Wei, Chuanyi Zhang, Guilin Qi, Miaozeng Du, Yongrui Chen, Sheng Bi, Fan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning empowers individuals with the `right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Jointly training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Wang, Praneeth Chakravarthula, Baoquan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have recently enabled high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. These approaches, however, are limited by the pinhole camera model and lack effective modeling of defocus effects. Departing from this, we introduce DOF-GS--a new 3DGS-based framework with a finite-aperture camera model and explicit, differentiable defocus rendering, enabling it to function as a post-capture control tool. By training with multi-view images with moderate defocus blur, DOF-GS learns inherent camera characteristics and reconstructs sharp details of the underlying scene, particularly, enabling rendering of varying DOF effects through on-demand aperture and focal distance control, post-capture and optimization. Additionally, our framework extracts circle-of-confusion cues during optimization to identify in-focus regions in input views, enhancing the reconstructed 3D scene details. Experimental results demonstrate that DOF-GS supports post-capture refocusing, adjustable defocus and high-quality all-in-focus rendering, from multi-view images with uncalibrated defocus blur.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Deng, Junbiao Pang, Baochang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising approach for effectively reducing the generalization error. However, SAM incurs twice the computational cost compared to base optimizer (e.g., SGD). We propose Asymptotic Unbiased Sampling with respect to iterations to accelerate SAM (AUSAM), which maintains the model's generalization capacity while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Concretely, we probabilistically sample a subset of data points beneficial for SAM optimization based on a theoretically guaranteed criterion, i.e., the Gradient Norm of each Sample (GNS). We further approximate the GNS by the difference in loss values before and after perturbation in SAM. As a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic method, our approach consistently accelerates SAM across a range of tasks and networks, i.e., classification, human pose estimation and network quantization. On CIFAR10/100 and Tiny-ImageNet, AUSAM achieves results comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of over 70%. Compared to recent dynamic data pruning methods, AUSAM is better suited for SAM and excels in maintaining performance. Additionally, AUSAM accelerates optimization in human pose estimation and model quantization without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luhui Cai, Weiming Zeng, Hongyu Chen, Hua Zhang, Yueyang Li, Yu Feng, Hongjie Yan, Lingbin Bian, Wai Ting Siok, Nizhuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph deep learning (GDL) has demonstrated impressive performance in predicting population-based brain disorders (BDs) through the integration of both imaging and non-imaging data. However, the effectiveness of GDL based methods heavily depends on the quality of modeling the multi-modal population graphs and tends to degrade as the graph scale increases. Furthermore, these methods often constrain interactions between imaging and non-imaging data to node-edge interactions within the graph, overlooking complex inter-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we propose MM-GTUNets, an end-to-end graph transformer based multi-modal graph deep learning (MMGDL) framework designed for brain disorders prediction at large scale. Specifically, to effectively leverage rich multi-modal information related to diseases, we introduce Modality Reward Representation Learning (MRRL) which adaptively constructs population graphs using a reward system. Additionally, we employ variational autoencoder to reconstruct latent representations of non-imaging features aligned with imaging features. Based on this, we propose Adaptive Cross-Modal Graph Learning (ACMGL), which captures critical modality-specific and modality-shared features through a unified GTUNet encoder taking advantages of Graph UNet and Graph Transformer, and feature fusion module. We validated our method on two public multi-modal datasets ABIDE and ADHD-200, demonstrating its superior performance in diagnosing BDs.

<p>Abstract: Few-shot action recognition aims to address the high cost and impracticality of manually labeling complex and variable video data in action recognition. It requires accurately classifying human actions in videos using only a few labeled examples per class. Compared to few-shot learning in image scenarios, few-shot action recognition is more challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of video data. Numerous approaches have driven significant advancements in few-shot action recognition, which underscores the need for a comprehensive survey. Unlike early surveys that focus on few-shot image or text classification, we deeply consider the unique challenges of few-shot action recognition. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of recent methods and introduce a novel and systematic taxonomy of existing approaches, accompanied by a detailed analysis. We categorize the methods into generative-based and meta-learning frameworks, and further elaborate on the methods within the meta-learning framework, covering aspects: video instance representation, category prototype learning, and generalized video alignment. Additionally, the survey presents the commonly used benchmarks and discusses relevant advanced topics and promising future directions. We hope this survey can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, offering essential guidance to newcomers and stimulating seasoned researchers with fresh insights.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most recent 3D instance segmentation methods are open vocabulary, offering a greater flexibility than closed-vocabulary methods. Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, \ie the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering "List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made available.

<p>Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning methods for human-object interaction (HOI) rely on labor-intensive, manually designed skill rewards that do not generalize well across different interactions. We introduce SkillMimic, a unified data-driven framework that fundamentally changes how agents learn interaction skills by eliminating the need for skill-specific rewards. Our key insight is that a unified HOI imitation reward can effectively capture the essence of diverse interaction patterns from HOI datasets. This enables SkillMimic to learn a single policy that not only masters multiple interaction skills but also facilitates skill transitions, with both diversity and generalization improving as the HOI dataset grows. For evaluation, we collect and introduce two basketball datasets containing approximately 35 minutes of diverse basketball skills. Extensive experiments show that SkillMimic successfully masters a wide range of basketball skills including stylistic variations in dribbling, layup, and shooting. Moreover, these learned skills can be effectively composed by a high-level controller to accomplish complex and long-horizon tasks such as consecutive scoring, opening new possibilities for scalable and generalizable interaction skill learning.

<p>Abstract: Human-human motion generation is essential for understanding humans as social beings. Current methods fall into two main categories: single-person-based methods and separate modeling-based methods. To delve into this field, we abstract the overall generation process into a general framework MetaMotion, which consists of two phases: temporal modeling and interaction mixing. For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties. Then we present Role-Evolving Scanning to adjust to the change in the active and passive roles throughout the interaction. Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns. Extensive experiments on InterHuman and InterX demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. Project page: https://aigc-explorer.github.io/TIMotion-page/</p>

<p>Abstract: Spacecraft image denoising is a crucial fundamental technology closely related to aerospace research. However, the existing deep learning-based image denoising methods are primarily designed for natural image and fail to adequately consider the characteristics of spacecraft image(e.g. low-light conditions, repetitive periodic structures), resulting in suboptimal performance in the spacecraft image denoising task. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a Structure modeling Activation Free Fourier Network (SAFFN), which is an efficient spacecraft image denoising method including Structure Modeling Block (SMB) and Activation Free Fourier Block (AFFB). We present SMB to effectively extract edge information and model the structure for better identification of spacecraft components from dark regions in spacecraft noise image. We present AFFB and utilize an improved Fast Fourier block to extract repetitive periodic features and long-range information in noisy spacecraft image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our SAFFN performs competitively compared to the state-of-the-art methods on spacecraft noise image datasets.

<p>Abstract: Generating images with accurately represented text, especially in non-Latin languages, poses a significant challenge for diffusion models. Existing approaches, such as the integration of hint condition diagrams via auxiliary networks (e.g., ControlNet), have made strides towards addressing this issue. However, diffusion models often fall short in tasks requiring controlled text generation, such as specifying particular fonts or producing text in small fonts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for multilingual visual text creation, named JoyType, designed to maintain the font style of text during the image generation process. Our methodology begins with assembling a training dataset, JoyType-1M, comprising 1 million pairs of data. Each pair includes an image, its description, and glyph instructions corresponding to the font style within the image. We then developed a text control network, Font ControlNet, tasked with extracting font style information to steer the image generation. To further enhance our model's ability to maintain font style, notably in generating small-font text, we incorporated a multi-layer OCR-aware loss into the diffusion process. This enhancement allows JoyType to direct text rendering using low-level descriptors. Our evaluations, based on both visual and accuracy metrics, demonstrate that JoyType significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, JoyType can function as a plugin, facilitating the creation of varied image styles in conjunction with other stable diffusion models on HuggingFace and CivitAI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Yu, Chengkai Jin, Huanyu Wang, Zhenghao Chen, Sheng Jin, Zhongrong Zuo, Xiaolei Xu, Zhenbang Sun, Bingni Zhang, Jiawei Wu, Hao Zhang, Qianru Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding tasks. However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivona Najdenkoska, Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani, Yuki M. Asano, Nanne van Noord, Marcel Worring, Cees G. M. Snoek</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of representing long captions in vision-language models, such as CLIP. By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute positional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and hindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent work has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle to model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed new token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer than the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal tasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.

<p>Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection in autonomous driving relies on Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception and effective temporal fusion.However, existing fusion strategies based on convolutional layers or deformable self attention struggle with global context modeling in BEV space,leading to lower accuracy for large objects. To address this, we introduce MambaBEV, a novel BEV based 3D object detection model that leverages Mamba2, an advanced state space model (SSM) optimized for long sequence processing.Our key contribution is TemporalMamba, a temporal fusion module that enhances global awareness by introducing a BEV feature discrete rearrangement mechanism tailored for Mamba's sequential processing. Additionally, we propose Mamba based DETR as the detection head to improve multi object representation.Evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MambaBEV base achieves an NDS of 51.7\% and an mAP of 42.7\%.Furthermore, an end to end autonomous driving paradigm validates its effectiveness in motion forecasting and planning.Our results highlight the potential of SSMs in autonomous driving perception, particularly in enhancing global context understanding and large object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Hao, Jiaming Han, Changsheng Li, Yu-Feng Li, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as general assistants. However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

<p>Abstract: Animation data is often obtained through optical motion capture systems, which utilize a multitude of cameras to establish the position of optical markers. However, system errors or occlusions can result in missing markers, the manual cleaning of which can be time-consuming. This has sparked interest in machine learning-based solutions for missing marker reconstruction in the academic community. Most academic papers utilize a simplistic mean square error as the main metric. In this paper, we show that this metric does not correlate with subjective perception of the fill quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a set of better-correlated metrics that can drive progress in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazanin Mahjourian, Vinh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jikang Cheng, Zhiyuan Yan, Ying Zhang, Li Hao, Jiaxin Ai, Qin Zou, Chen Li, Zhongyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of face forgery techniques has introduced a growing variety of forgeries. Incremental Face Forgery Detection (IFFD), involving gradually adding new forgery data to fine-tune the previously trained model, has been introduced as a promising strategy to deal with evolving forgery methods. However, a naively trained IFFD model is prone to catastrophic forgetting when new forgeries are integrated, as treating all forgeries as a single ''Fake" class in the Real/Fake classification can cause different forgery types overriding one another, thereby resulting in the forgetting of unique characteristics from earlier tasks and limiting the model's effectiveness in learning forgery specificity and generality. In this paper, we propose to stack the latent feature distributions of previous and new tasks brick by brick, $\textit{i.e.}$, achieving $\textbf{aligned feature isolation}$. In this manner, we aim to preserve learned forgery information and accumulate new knowledge by minimizing distribution overriding, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To achieve this, we first introduce Sparse Uniform Replay (SUR) to obtain the representative subsets that could be treated as the uniformly sparse versions of the previous global distributions. We then propose a Latent-space Incremental Detector (LID) that leverages SUR data to isolate and align distributions. For evaluation, we construct a more advanced and comprehensive benchmark tailored for IFFD. The leading experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks tend to rely on continuous, smooth features. While this characteristics provides significant robustness and proves useful in many real-world tasks, it is strikingly incompatible with the physical characteristic of the world, which, at the scale in which humans operate, comprises crisp objects, typically representing well-defined categories. This study proposes a class of neurosymbolic systems that learn by reconstructing images in terms of visual primitives and are thus forced to form high-level, structural explanations of them. When applied to the task of diagnosing abnormalities in histological imaging, the method proved superior to a conventional deep learning architecture in terms of classification accuracy, while being more transparent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Why don't we have foundation models in 3D yet? A key limitation is data scarcity. For 3D object part segmentation, existing datasets are small in size and lack diversity. We show that it is possible to break this data barrier by building a data engine powered by 2D foundation models. Our data engine automatically annotates any number of object parts: 1755x more unique part types than existing datasets combined. By training on our annotated data with a simple contrastive objective, we obtain an open-world model that generalizes to any part in any object based on any text query. Even when evaluated zero-shot, we outperform existing methods on the datasets they train on. We achieve 260% improvement in mIoU and boost speed by 6x to 300x. Our scaling analysis confirms that this generalization stems from the data scale, which underscores the impact of our data engine. Finally, to advance general-category open-world 3D part segmentation, we release a benchmark covering a wide range of objects and parts. Project website: https://ziqi-ma.github.io/find3dsite/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anxhelo Diko, Tinghuai Wang, Wassim Swaileh, Shiyan Sun, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for applications requiring integrated understanding textual and visual information. However, existing VLMs struggle with long videos due to computational inefficiency, memory limitations, and difficulties in maintaining coherent understanding across extended sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce ReWind, a novel memory-based VLM designed for efficient long video understanding while preserving temporal fidelity. ReWind operates in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, ReWind maintains a dynamic learnable memory module with a novel \textbf{read-perceive-write} cycle that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds. This module utilizes learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream, ensuring low memory requirements by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. In the second stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the memory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the memory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few high-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer. We empirically demonstrate ReWind's superior performance in visual question answering (VQA) and temporal grounding tasks, surpassing previous methods on long video benchmarks. Notably, ReWind achieves a +13\% score gain and a +12\% accuracy improvement on the MovieChat-1K VQA dataset and an +8\% mIoU increase on Charades-STA for temporal grounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anxhelo Diko, Antonino Furnari, Luigi Cinque, Giovanni Maria Farinella</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce LAGUNA - LAnguage Guided UNsupervised Adaptation with structured spaces, a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. LAGUNA defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. We empirically demonstrate LAGUNA's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse images and video datasets. Remarkably, LAGUNA surpasses previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Yucheng Zhou, Xiaoye Qu, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for image and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, a novel DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration without quality loss and high fidelity to original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish long-skip connections as critical architectural components for training stable and efficient diffusion transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</p>

To brighten shadow regions and repair the corrupted textures in the luminance space, we customize LRNet, a U-shaped network with a rectified attention module, to enhance information interaction and recalibrate contaminated attention maps. With luminance recovered, CRNet then leverages cross-attention mechanisms to revive vibrant colors, producing visually compelling results. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of ShadowHack over existing state-of-the-art solutions both quantitatively and qualitatively, highlighting the effectiveness of our design.

<p>Abstract: Motion control is crucial for generating expressive and compelling video content; however, most existing video generation models rely mainly on text prompts for control, which struggle to capture the nuances of dynamic actions and temporal compositions. To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance. Video results are available on our webpage: https://motion-prompting.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in video diffusion models have enabled the creation of realistic videos, raising concerns about unauthorized use and driving the demand for techniques to protect model ownership. Existing watermarking methods, while effective for image diffusion models, do not account for temporal consistency, leading to degraded video quality and reduced robustness against video distortions. To address this issue, we introduce LVMark, a novel watermarking method for video diffusion models. We propose a new watermark decoder tailored for generated videos by learning the consistency between adjacent frames. It ensures accurate message decoding, even under malicious attacks, by combining the low-frequency components of the 3D wavelet domain with the RGB features of the video. Additionally, our approach minimizes video quality degradation by embedding watermark messages in layers with minimal impact on visual appearance using an importance-based weight modulation strategy. We optimize both the watermark decoder and the latent decoder of diffusion model, effectively balancing the trade-off between visual quality and bit accuracy. Our experiments show that our method embeds invisible watermarks into video diffusion models, ensuring robust decoding accuracy with 512-bit capacity, even under video distortions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxiao Fan, Kan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Noisy labels can negatively impact the performance of deep neural networks. One common solution is label refurbishment, which involves reconstructing noisy labels through predictions and distributions. However, these methods may introduce problematic semantic associations, a phenomenon that we identify as Semantic Contamination. Through an analysis of Robust LR, a representative label refurbishment method, we found that utilizing the logits of views for refurbishment does not adequately balance the semantic information of individual classes. Conversely, using the logits of models fails to maintain consistent semantic relationships across models, which explains why label refurbishment methods frequently encounter issues related to Semantic Contamination. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Collaborative Cross Learning, which utilizes semi-supervised learning on refurbished labels to extract appropriate semantic associations from embeddings across views and models. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, effectively mitigating the impact of label noise and Semantic Contamination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generation have leveraged diffusion models to enhance visual coherence in videos synthesized from textual descriptions. However, existing research primarily focuses on object motion, often overlooking cinematic language, which is crucial for conveying emotion and narrative pacing in cinematography. To address this, we propose a threefold approach to improve cinematic control in T2V models. First, we introduce a meticulously annotated cinematic language dataset with twenty subcategories, covering shot framing, shot angles, and camera movements, enabling models to learn diverse cinematic styles. Second, we present CameraDiff, which employs LoRA for precise and stable cinematic control, ensuring flexible shot generation. Third, we propose CameraCLIP, designed to evaluate cinematic alignment and guide multi-shot composition. Building on CameraCLIP, we introduce CLIPLoRA, a CLIP-guided dynamic LoRA composition method that adaptively fuses multiple pre-trained cinematic LoRAs, enabling smooth transitions and seamless style blending. Experimental results demonstrate that CameraDiff ensures stable and precise cinematic control, CameraCLIP achieves an R@1 score of 0.83, and CLIPLoRA significantly enhances multi-shot composition within a single video, bridging the gap between automated video generation and professional cinematography.\textsuperscript{1}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Wang, Hao Ouyang, Qiuyu Wang, Wen Wang, Ka Leong Cheng, Qifeng Chen, Yujun Shen, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The intuitive nature of drag-based interaction has led to its growing adoption for controlling object trajectories in image-to-video synthesis. Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuomeng Zhang, Fangqi Li, Chong Di, Hongyu Zhu, Hanyi Wang, Shilin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive synthesis quality of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, their black-box deployment poses significant regulatory challenges: Malicious actors can fine-tune these models to generate illegal content, circumventing existing safeguards through parameter manipulation. Therefore, it is essential to verify the integrity of T2I diffusion models. To this end, considering the randomness within the outputs of generative models and the high costs in interacting with them, we discern model tampering via the KL divergence between the distributions of the features of generated images. We propose a novel prompt selection algorithm based on learning automaton (PromptLA) for efficient and accurate verification. Evaluations on four advanced T2I models (e.g., SDXL, FLUX.1) demonstrate that our method achieves a mean AUC of over 0.96 in integrity detection, exceeding baselines by more than 0.2, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalization. Additionally, our approach achieves lower cost and is robust against image-level post-processing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work addressing the integrity verification of T2I diffusion models, which establishes quantifiable standards for AI copyright litigation in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchi Wang, Junliang Guo, Xinyi Xie, Tianyu He, Xu Sun, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of video generation. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact video autoencoder, VidTwin, that decouples video into two distinct latent spaces: Structure latent vectors, which capture overall content and global movement, and Dynamics latent vectors, which represent fine-grained details and rapid movements. Specifically, our approach leverages an Encoder-Decoder backbone, augmented with two submodules for extracting these latent spaces, respectively. The first submodule employs a Q-Former to extract low-frequency motion trends, followed by downsampling blocks to remove redundant content details. The second averages the latent vectors along the spatial dimension to capture rapid motion. Extensive experiments show that VidTwin achieves a high compression rate of 0.20% with high reconstruction quality (PSNR of 28.14 on the MCL-JCV dataset), and performs efficiently and effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, our model demonstrates explainability and scalability, paving the way for future research in video latent representation and generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Wang, Ziang Cheng, Zhenyu Li, Jiayu Yang, Haorui Ji, Pan Ji, Mehrtash Harandi, Richard Hartley, Hongdong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes DoubleDiffusion, a novel framework that combines heat dissipation diffusion and denoising diffusion for direct generative learning on 3D mesh surfaces. Our approach addresses the challenges of generating continuous signal distributions residing on a curve manifold surface. Unlike previous methods that rely on unrolling 3D meshes into 2D or adopting field representations, DoubleDiffusion leverages the Laplacian-Beltrami operator to process features respecting the mesh structure. This combination enables effective geometry-aware signal diffusion across the underlying geometry. As shown in Fig.1, we demonstrate that DoubleDiffusion has the ability to generate RGB signal distributions on complex 3D mesh surfaces and achieves per-category shape-conditioned texture generation across different shape geometry. Our work contributes a new direction in diffusion-based generative modeling on 3D surfaces, with potential applications in the field of 3D asset generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungmin Baek, Soyul Lee, Hayeon Jo, Hyesong Choi, Dongbo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning paradigm has driven substantial advancements in various vision tasks. However, as state-of-the-art models continue to grow, classical full fine-tuning often becomes computationally impractical, particularly in multi-task learning (MTL) setup where training complexity increases proportional to the number of tasks. Consequently, recent studies have explored Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for MTL architectures. Despite some progress, these approaches still exhibit limitations in capturing fine-grained, task-specific features that are crucial to MTL. In this paper, we introduce Task-Adaptive Dynamic transFormer, termed TADFormer, a novel PEFT framework that performs task-aware feature adaptation in the fine-grained manner by dynamically considering task-specific input contexts. TADFormer proposes the parameter-efficient prompting for task adaptation and the Dynamic Task Filter (DTF) to capture task information conditioned on input contexts. Experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in dense scene understanding tasks, while reducing the number of trainable parameters by up to 8.4 times when compared to full fine-tuning of MTL models. TADFormer also demonstrates superior parameter efficiency and accuracy compared to recent PEFT methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ludwic Leonard, Nils Thuerey, Ruediger Westermann</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a single-view reconstruction technique of volumetric fields in which multiple light scattering effects are omnipresent, such as in clouds. We model the unknown distribution of volumetric fields using an unconditional diffusion model trained on a novel benchmark dataset comprising 1,000 synthetically simulated volumetric density fields. The neural diffusion model is trained on the latent codes of a novel, diffusion-friendly, monoplanar representation. The generative model is used to incorporate a tailored parametric diffusion posterior sampling technique into different reconstruction tasks. A physically-based differentiable volume renderer is employed to provide gradients with respect to light transport in the latent space. This stands in contrast to classic NeRF approaches and makes the reconstructions better aligned with observed data. Through various experiments, we demonstrate single-view reconstruction of volumetric clouds at a previously unattainable quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Gwilliam, Han Cai, Di Wu, Abhinav Shrivastava, Zhiyu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damiano Marsili, Rohun Agrawal, Yisong Yue, Georgia Gkioxari</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reasoning -- the ability to interpret the visual world -- is crucial for embodied agents that operate within three-dimensional scenes. Progress in AI has led to vision and language models capable of answering questions from images. However, their performance declines when tasked with 3D spatial reasoning. To tackle the complexity of such reasoning problems, we introduce an agentic program synthesis approach where LLM agents collaboratively generate a Pythonic API with new functions to solve common subproblems. Our method overcomes limitations of prior approaches that rely on a static, human-defined API, allowing it to handle a wider range of queries. To assess AI capabilities for 3D understanding, we introduce a new benchmark of queries involving multiple steps of grounding and inference. We show that our method outperforms prior zero-shot models for visual reasoning in 3D and empirically validate the effectiveness of our agentic framework for 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqian Shen, Yunhan Zhao, Nahyun Kwon, Jeeeun Kim, Yanan Li, Shu Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance detection (InsDet) aims to localize specific object instances within a novel scene imagery based on given visual references. Technically, it requires proposal detection to identify all possible object instances, followed by instance-level matching to pinpoint the ones of interest. Its open-world nature supports its broad applications from robotics to AR/VR but also presents significant challenges: methods must generalize to unknown testing data distributions because (1) the testing scene imagery is unseen during training, and (2) there are domain gaps between visual references and detected proposals. Existing methods tackle these challenges by synthesizing diverse training examples or utilizing off-the-shelf foundation models (FMs). However, they only partially capitalize the available open-world information. In contrast, we approach InsDet from an Open-World perspective, introducing our method IDOW. We find that, while pretrained FMs yield high recall in instance detection, they are not specifically optimized for instance-level feature matching. Therefore, we adapt pretrained FMs for improved instance-level matching using open-world data. Our approach incorporates metric learning along with novel data augmentations, which sample distractors as negative examples and synthesize novel-view instances to enrich the visual references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior works, achieving >10 AP over previous results on two recently released challenging benchmark datasets in both conventional and novel instance detection settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Liu, Linghe Kong, Guihai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment anything model (SAM) has shown impressive general-purpose segmentation performance on natural images, but its performance on camouflaged object detection (COD) is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose SAM-COD that performs camouflaged object detection for RGB-D inputs. While keeping the SAM architecture intact, dual stream adapters are expanded on the image encoder to learn potential complementary information from RGB images and depth images, and fine-tune the mask decoder and its depth replica to perform dual-stream mask prediction. In practice, the dual stream adapters are embedded into the attention block of the image encoder in a parallel manner to facilitate the refinement and correction of the two types of image embeddings. To mitigate channel discrepancies arising from dual stream embeddings that do not directly interact with each other, we augment the association of dual stream embeddings using bidirectional knowledge distillation including a model distiller and a modal distiller. In addition, to predict the masks for RGB and depth attention maps, we hybridize the two types of image embeddings which are jointly learned with the prompt embeddings to update the initial prompt, and then feed them into the mask decoders to synchronize the consistency of image embeddings and prompt embeddings. Experimental results on four COD benchmarks show that our SAM-COD achieves excellent detection performance gains over SAM and achieves state-of-the-art results with a given fine-tuning paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianjie Liu, Keren Fu, Qijun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) is a high-precision object segmentation task for high-resolution natural images. The current mainstream methods focus on the optimization of local details but overlook the fundamental challenge of modeling the integrity of objects. We have found that the depth integrity-prior implicit in the the pseudo-depth maps generated by Depth Anything Model v2 and the local detail features of image patches can jointly address the above dilemmas. Based on the above findings, we have designed a novel Patch-Depth Fusion Network (PDFNet) for high-precision dichotomous image segmentation. The core of PDFNet consists of three aspects. Firstly, the object perception is enhanced through multi-modal input fusion. By utilizing the patch fine-grained strategy, coupled with patch selection and enhancement, the sensitivity to details is improved. Secondly, by leveraging the depth integrity-prior distributed in the depth maps, we propose an integrity-prior loss to enhance the uniformity of the segmentation results in the depth maps. Finally, we utilize the features of the shared encoder and, through a simple depth refinement decoder, improve the ability of the shared encoder to capture subtle depth-related information in the images. Experiments on the DIS-5K dataset show that PDFNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art non-diffusion methods. Due to the incorporation of the depth integrity-prior, PDFNet achieves or even surpassing the performance of the latest diffusion-based methods while using less than 11% of the parameters of diffusion-based methods.

<p>Abstract: With the rise of real-world human-AI interaction applications, such as AI assistants, the need for Streaming Video Dialogue is critical. To address this need, we introduce StreamMind, a video LLM framework that achieves ultra-FPS streaming video processing (100 fps on a single A100) and enables proactive, always-on responses in real time, without explicit user intervention.
  To solve the key challenge of the contradiction between linear video streaming speed and quadratic transformer computation cost, we propose a novel perception-cognition interleaving paradigm named ''event-gated LLM invocation'', in contrast to the existing per-time-step LLM invocation. By introducing a Cognition Gate network between the video encoder and the LLM, LLM is only invoked when relevant events occur. To realize the event feature extraction with constant cost, we propose Event-Preserving Feature Extractor (EPFE) based on state-space method, generating a single perception token for spatiotemporal features. These techniques enable the video LLM with full-FPS perception and real-time cognition response.
  Experiments on Ego4D and SoccerNet streaming tasks, as well as standard offline benchmarks, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both model capability and real-time efficiency, paving the way for ultra-high-FPS applications, such as Game AI and interactive media.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Xie, Jiawei Liu, Ziyue Lin, Huijie Fan, Zhi Han, Yandong Tang, Liangqiong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural changes. Unlike prior work that requires complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, <HYBNEXT>. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training from text-generation-only LLMs or random initialization, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet), and 7.5% (ImageNet) for advanced autoregressive LLMs like Chameleon and LlamaGen, all without framework modifications. For domain adaption, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). By demonstrating that training objective redesign -- not just architectural innovation -- can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges, ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. Code and models will be released to advance autoregressive image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, efficiently processing long videos remains a challenge due to the ``Sampling Dilemma'': low-density sampling risks missing critical information, while high-density sampling introduces redundancy. To address this issue, we introduce LSDBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LVLMs on long-video tasks by constructing high Necessary Sampling Density (NSD) questions, where NSD represents the minimum sampling density required to accurately answer a given question. LSDBench focuses on dense, short-duration actions to rigorously assess the sampling strategies employed by LVLMs. To tackle the challenges posed by high-NSD questions, we propose a novel Reasoning-Driven Hierarchical Sampling (RHS) framework, which combines global localization of question-relevant cues with local dense sampling for precise inference. Additionally, we develop a lightweight Semantic-Guided Frame Selector to prioritize informative frames, enabling RHS to achieve comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer sampled frames. Together, our LSDBench and RHS framework address the unique challenges of high-NSD long-video tasks, setting a new standard for evaluating and improving LVLMs in this domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong Li, Cristiano Saltori, Fabio Poiesi, Nicu Sebe</p>
<p>Abstract: The lack of a large-scale 3D-text corpus has led recent works to distill open-vocabulary knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods typically rely on a single VLM to align the feature spaces of 3D models within a common language space, which limits the potential of 3D models to leverage the diverse spatial and semantic capabilities encapsulated in various foundation models. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal and Uncertainty-aware Agglomeration for Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding dubbed CUA-O3D, the first model to integrate multiple foundation models-such as CLIP, DINOv2, and Stable Diffusion-into 3D scene understanding. We further introduce a deterministic uncertainty estimation to adaptively distill and harmonize the heterogeneous 2D feature embeddings from these models. Our method addresses two key challenges: (1) incorporating semantic priors from VLMs alongside the geometric knowledge of spatially-aware vision foundation models, and (2) using a novel deterministic uncertainty estimation to capture model-specific uncertainties across diverse semantic and geometric sensitivities, helping to reconcile heterogeneous representations during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanghua Yu, Jinjin Gu, Jinfan Hu, Zheyuan Li, Chao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce UniCon, a novel architecture designed to enhance control and efficiency in training adapters for large-scale diffusion models. Unlike existing methods that rely on bidirectional interaction between the diffusion model and control adapter, UniCon implements a unidirectional flow from the diffusion network to the adapter, allowing the adapter alone to generate the final output. UniCon reduces computational demands by eliminating the need for the diffusion model to compute and store gradients during adapter training. Our results indicate that UniCon reduces GPU memory usage by one-third and increases training speed by 2.3 times, while maintaining the same adapter parameter size. Additionally, without requiring extra computational resources, UniCon enables the training of adapters with double the parameter volume of existing ControlNets. In a series of image conditional generation tasks, UniCon has demonstrated precise responsiveness to control inputs and exceptional generation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinjin Zhang, Qiuyu Huang, Junjie Liu, Xiefan Guo, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present Diffusion-4K, a novel framework for direct ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using text-to-image diffusion models. The core advancements include: (1) Aesthetic-4K Benchmark: addressing the absence of a publicly available 4K image synthesis dataset, we construct Aesthetic-4K, a comprehensive benchmark for ultra-high-resolution image generation. We curated a high-quality 4K dataset with carefully selected images and captions generated by GPT-4o. Additionally, we introduce GLCM Score and Compression Ratio metrics to evaluate fine details, combined with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics and CLIPScore for a comprehensive assessment of ultra-high-resolution images. (2) Wavelet-based Fine-tuning: we propose a wavelet-based fine-tuning approach for direct training with photorealistic 4K images, applicable to various latent diffusion models, demonstrating its effectiveness in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves impressive performance in high-quality image synthesis and text prompt adherence, especially when powered by modern large-scale diffusion models (e.g., SD3-2B and Flux-12B). Extensive experimental results from our benchmark demonstrate the superiority of Diffusion-4K in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shujuan Li, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing open surfaces from multi-view images is vital in digitalizing complex objects in daily life. A widely used strategy is to learn unsigned distance functions (UDFs) by checking if their appearance conforms to the image observations through neural rendering. However, it is still hard to learn continuous and implicit UDF representations through 3D Gaussians splatting (3DGS) due to the discrete and explicit scene representation, i.e., 3D Gaussians. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between 3D Gaussians and UDFs. Our key idea is to overfit thin and flat 2D Gaussian planes on surfaces, and then, leverage the self-supervision and gradient-based inference to supervise unsigned distances in both near and far area to surfaces. To this end, we introduce novel constraints and strategies to constrain the learning of 2D Gaussians to pursue more stable optimization and more reliable self-supervision, addressing the challenges brought by complicated gradient field on or near the zero level set of UDFs. We report numerical and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art on widely used benchmarks and real data to show our advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and sharpness of reconstructed open surfaces with boundaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncen Guo, Xiaoguang Zhu, Liangyu Teng, Hao Yang, Jing Liu, Yang Liu, Liang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental Learning (CIL) enables the model to incrementally absorb knowledge from new classes and build a generic classifier across all previously encountered classes. When the model optimizes with new classes, the knowledge of previous classes is inevitably erased, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Addressing this challenge requires making a trade-off between retaining old knowledge and accommodating new information. However, this balancing process often requires sacrificing some information, which can lead to a partial loss in the model's ability to discriminate between classes. To tackle this issue, we design the adaptive weighted parameter fusion with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which not only takes into account the variability of the data distribution of different tasks, but also retains all the effective information of the parameter matrix to the greatest extent. In addition, we introduce a balance factor that can balance the data distribution alignment and distinguishability of adjacent tasks. Experimental results on several traditional benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Videos inherently contain multiple modalities, including visual events, text overlays, sounds, and speech, all of which are important for retrieval. However, state-of-the-art multimodal language models like VAST and LanguageBind are built on vision-language models (VLMs), and thus overly prioritize visual signals. Retrieval benchmarks further reinforce this bias by focusing on visual queries and neglecting other modalities. We create a search system MMMORRF that extracts text and features from both visual and audio modalities and integrates them with a novel modality-aware weighted reciprocal rank fusion. MMMORRF is both effective and efficient, demonstrating practicality in searching videos based on users' information needs instead of visual descriptive queries. We evaluate MMMORRF on MultiVENT 2.0 and TVR, two multimodal benchmarks designed for more targeted information needs, and find that it improves nDCG@20 by 81% over leading multimodal encoders and 37% over single-modality retrieval, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and multimodal models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large-scale training on extensive datasets. However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content. The "X" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation. At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g., SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments showcase novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps, empowered by LLMs in feedback loops. These advancements broaden the scope of agentic AI applications by providing a foundation for scalable, contextually and spatiotemporally aware systems capable of immersive dynamic 4D scene interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual narrative generation transforms textual narratives into sequences of images illustrating the content of the text. However, generating visual narratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across generated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge constraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new benchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the underlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples, offering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual storytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further propose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated narrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual narrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that learning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the faithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Quan, Ao Tong, Yuxuan Cai, Xinwei He, Yulong Wang, Yang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection(MUAD), reconstruction-based methods learn to map input images to normal patterns to identify anomalous pixels. However, this strategy easily falls into the well-known "learning shortcut" issue when decoders fail to capture normal patterns and reconstruct both normal and abnormal samples naively. To address that, we propose to learn the input features in global and local manners, forcing the network to memorize the normal patterns more comprehensively. Specifically, we design a two-branch decoder block, named Omni-block. One branch corresponds to global feature learning, where we serialize two self-attention blocks but replace the query and (key, value) with learnable tokens, respectively, thus capturing global features of normal patterns concisely and thoroughly. The local branch comprises depth-separable convolutions, whose locality enables effective and efficient learning of local features for normal patterns. By stacking Omni-blocks, we build a framework, Omni-AD, to learn normal patterns of different granularity and reconstruct them progressively. Comprehensive experiments on public anomaly detection benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in MUAD. Code is available at https://github.com/easyoo/Omni-AD.git</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyue Tu, Siqi Wu, Li Li, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoencoder-based structures have dominated recent learned image compression methods. However, the inherent information loss associated with autoencoders limits their rate-distortion performance at high bit rates and restricts their flexibility of rate adaptation. In this paper, we present a variable-rate image compression model based on invertible transform to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we design a lightweight multi-scale invertible neural network, which bijectively maps the input image into multi-scale latent representations. To improve the compression efficiency, a multi-scale spatial-channel context model with extended gain units is devised to estimate the entropy of the latent representation from high to low levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing variable-rate methods, and remains competitive with recent multi-model approaches. Notably, our method is the first learned image compression solution that outperforms VVC across a very wide range of bit rates using a single model, especially at high bit rates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achint Soni, Meet Soni, Sirisha Rambhatla</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing aims to modify specific regions of an image according to natural language instructions while maintaining the general structure and the background fidelity. Existing methods utilize masks derived from cross-attention maps generated from diffusion models to identify the target regions for modification. However, since cross-attention mechanisms focus on semantic relevance, they struggle to maintain the image integrity. As a result, these methods often lack spatial consistency, leading to editing artifacts and distortions. In this work, we address these limitations and introduce LOCATEdit, which enhances cross-attention maps through a graph-based approach utilizing self-attention-derived patch relationships to maintain smooth, coherent attention across image regions, ensuring that alterations are limited to the designated items while retaining the surrounding structure. LOCATEdit consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on PIE-Bench, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness on various editing tasks.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models show significant potential for advancing AI-assisted medical diagnostics, particularly in detecting lung cancer through medical image modalities such as chest X-rays. However, the black-box nature of these models poses challenges to their interpretability and trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. This study examines both the interpretability and robustness of a high-performing lung cancer detection model based on InceptionV3, utilizing a public dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. We evaluate the clinical utility of multiple explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including both post-hoc and ante-hoc approaches, and find that existing methods often fail to provide clinically relevant explanations, displaying inconsistencies and divergence from expert radiologist assessments. To address these limitations, we collaborated with a radiologist to define diagnosis-specific clinical concepts and developed ClinicXAI, an expert-driven approach leveraging the concept bottleneck methodology. ClinicXAI generated clinically meaningful explanations which closely aligned with the practical requirements of clinicians while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. We also assess the robustness of ClinicXAI in comparison to the original InceptionV3 model by subjecting both to a series of widely utilized adversarial attacks. Our analysis demonstrates that ClinicXAI exhibits significantly greater resilience to adversarial perturbations. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating domain expertise into the design of interpretable and robust AI systems for medical diagnostics, paving the way for more trustworthy and effective AI solutions in healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haresh Rengaraj Rajamohan, Richard Kijowski, Kyunghyun Cho, Cem M. Deniz</p>
<p>Abstract: We developed deep learning models for predicting Total Knee Replacement (TKR) need within various time horizons in knee osteoarthritis patients, with a novel capability: the models can perform TKR prediction using a single scan, and furthermore when a previous scan is available, they leverage a progressive risk formulation to improve their predictions. Unlike conventional approaches that treat each scan of a patient independently, our method incorporates a constraint based on disease's progressive nature, ensuring that predicted TKR risk either increases or remains stable over time when multiple scans of a knee are available. This was achieved by enforcing a progressive risk formulation constraint during training with patients who have more than one available scan in the studies. Knee radiographs and MRIs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) were used in this work and deep learning models were trained to predict TKR within 1, 2, and 4-year time periods. The proposed approach, utilizing a dual-model risk constraint architecture, demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline - conventional models trained with standard binary cross entropy loss. It achieved an AUROC of 0.87 and AUPRC of 0.47 for 1-year TKR prediction on the OAI radiograph test set, considerably improving over the baseline AUROC of 0.79 and AUPRC of 0.34. For the MOST radiograph test set, the proposed approach achieved an AUROC of 0.77 and AUPRC of 0.25 for 1-year predictions, outperforming the baseline AUROC of 0.71 and AUPRC of 0.19. Similar trends were observed in the MRI testsets</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometric reconstruction of opaque surfaces from images is a longstanding challenge in computer vision, with renewed interest from volumetric view synthesis algorithms using radiance fields. We leverage the geometry field proposed in recent work for stochastic opaque surfaces, which can then be converted to volume densities. We adapt Gaussian kernels or surfels to splat the geometry field rather than the volume, enabling precise reconstruction of opaque solids. Our first contribution is to derive an efficient and almost exact differentiable rendering algorithm for geometry fields parameterized by Gaussian surfels, while removing current approximations involving Taylor series and no self-attenuation. Next, we address the discontinuous loss landscape when surfels cluster near geometry, showing how to guarantee that the rendered color is a continuous function of the colors of the kernels, irrespective of ordering. Finally, we use latent representations with spherical harmonics encoded reflection vectors rather than spherical harmonics encoded colors to better address specular surfaces. We demonstrate significant improvement in the quality of reconstructed 3D surfaces on widely-used datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The research presented in this paper advances the integration of Hebbian learning into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing, systematically exploring different architectures to build an optimal configuration, adhering to biological tenability. Hebbian learning operates on local unsupervised neural information to form feature representations, providing an alternative to the popular but arguably biologically implausible and computationally intensive backpropagation learning algorithm. The suggested optimal architecture significantly enhances recent research aimed at integrating Hebbian learning with competition mechanisms and CNNs, expanding their representational capabilities by incorporating hard Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition, Gaussian lateral inhibition mechanisms, and Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule in a single model. Mean accuracy classification measures during the last half of test epochs on CIFAR-10 revealed that the resulting optimal model matched its end-to-end backpropagation variant with 75.2% each, critically surpassing the state-of-the-art hard-WTA performance in CNNs of the same network depth (64.6%) by 10.6%. It also achieved competitive performance on MNIST (98%) and STL-10 (69.5%). Moreover, results showed clear indications of sparse hierarchical learning through increasingly complex and abstract receptive fields. In summary, our implementation enhances both the performance and the generalisability of the learnt representations and constitutes a crucial step towards more biologically realistic artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image classification tasks are becoming widely implemented in AI-assisted diagnostic tools, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce clinician workloads, and improve patient outcomes. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Information theory and Shannon entropy are essential for quantifying irregularity in complex systems or signals. Recently, two-dimensional entropy methods, such as two-dimensional sample entropy, distribution entropy, and permutation entropy, have been proposed for analyzing 2D texture or image data. This paper introduces Gradient entropy (GradEn), an extension of slope entropy to 2D, which considers both symbolic patterns and amplitude information, enabling better feature extraction from image data. We evaluate GradEn with simulated data, including 2D colored noise, 2D mixed processes, and the logistic map. Results show the ability of GradEn to distinguish images with various characteristics while maintaining low computational cost. Real-world datasets, consist of texture, fault gear, and railway corrugation signals, demonstrate the superior performance of GradEn in classification tasks compared to other 2D entropy methods. In conclusion, GradEn is an effective tool for image characterization, offering a novel approach for image processing and recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanzhou Ke, Shengfeng He, Xiao Li Wang, Bo Wang, Guoqing Chao, Yuanyang Zhang, Yi Xie, HeXing Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhi Chen, Boyang Sun, Anran Zhang, Marc Pollefeys, Stefan Leutenegger</p>
<p>Abstract: Future robots are envisioned as versatile systems capable of performing a variety of household tasks. The big question remains, how can we bridge the embodiment gap while minimizing physical robot learning, which fundamentally does not scale well. We argue that learning from in-the-wild human videos offers a promising solution for robotic manipulation tasks, as vast amounts of relevant data already exist on the internet. In this work, we present VidBot, a framework enabling zero-shot robotic manipulation using learned 3D affordance from in-the-wild monocular RGB-only human videos. VidBot leverages a pipeline to extract explicit representations from them, namely 3D hand trajectories from videos, combining a depth foundation model with structure-from-motion techniques to reconstruct temporally consistent, metric-scale 3D affordance representations agnostic to embodiments. We introduce a coarse-to-fine affordance learning model that first identifies coarse actions from the pixel space and then generates fine-grained interaction trajectories with a diffusion model, conditioned on coarse actions and guided by test-time constraints for context-aware interaction planning, enabling substantial generalization to novel scenes and embodiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VidBot, which significantly outperforms counterparts across 13 manipulation tasks in zero-shot settings and can be seamlessly deployed across robot systems in real-world environments. VidBot paves the way for leveraging everyday human videos to make robot learning more scalable.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835">How Can Time Series Analysis Benefit From Multiple Modalities? A Survey and Outlook</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxin Liu, Harshavardhan Kamarthi, Zhiyuan Zhao, Shangqing Xu, Shiyu Wang, Qingsong Wen, Tom Hartvigsen, Fei Wang, B. Aditya Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14536">Advancing Chronic Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Vision-Language Models: A Multi modal Framework for Precision Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Praveen Shastry, Sowmya Chowdary Muthulur, Naveen Kumarasami, Anandakumar D, Mounigasri M, Keerthana R, Kishore Prasath Venkatesh, Bargava Subramanian, Kalyan Sivasailam, Revathi Ezhumalai, Abitha Marimuthu</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: This study proposes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging the SIGLIP encoder and Gemma-3b transformer decoder to enhance automated chronic tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images with clinical data, the model addresses the challenges of manual interpretation, improving diagnostic consistency and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
  Methods: The VLM architecture combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual encoding and a transformer-based text encoder to process clinical context, such as patient histories and treatment records. Cross-modal attention mechanisms align radiographic features with textual information, while the Gemma-3b decoder generates comprehensive diagnostic reports. The model was pre-trained on 5 million paired medical images and texts and fine-tuned using 100,000 chronic TB-specific chest X-rays.
  Results: The model demonstrated high precision (94 percent) and recall (94 percent) for detecting key chronic TB pathologies, including fibrosis, calcified granulomas, and bronchiectasis. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores exceeded 0.93, and Intersection over Union (IoU) values were above 0.91, validating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing TB-related abnormalities.
  Conclusion: The VLM offers a robust and scalable solution for automated chronic TB diagnosis, integrating radiographic and clinical data to deliver actionable and context-aware insights. Future work will address subtle pathologies and dataset biases to enhance the model's generalizability, ensuring equitable performance across diverse populations and healthcare settings.</p>
