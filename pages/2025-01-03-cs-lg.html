<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00032">Highly Optimized Kernels and Fine-Grained Codebooks for LLM Inference on Arm CPUs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibakar Gope, David Mansell, Danny Loh, Ian Bratt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we think about language understanding and generation, enthralling both researchers and developers. However, deploying LLMs for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented size and resource requirements. While quantizing model weights to sub-byte precision has emerged as a promising solution to ease memory pressure, the group quantization formats commonly used for LLM quantization have significant compute overheads and a resource-intensive dequantization process. As a result, a higher proportion of compute instructions do not perform multiplies, i.e., real work, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the required latency requirements for LLMs deployed on commodity CPUs. In this work, we propose a set of highly optimized kernels to accelerate LLM inference and unleash the full potential of CPUs, particularly Arm CPUs. These kernels amortize the cost of loading the operands and the cost of weight unpacking across multiple output rows. This, along with the introduction of an optimized interleaved group data layout for weights and decompression path optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations and dequantization overhead while maximizing the use of vector and matrix multiply operations, significantly improves the efficiency of MAC operations. Furthermore, we present a groupwise non-uniform codebook-based quantization method for ultra-low-precision quantization of LLMs to better match non-uniform patterns in their weight distributions, demonstrating better throughput during token generation while ensuring better quality than the state-of-the-art. Applying these improvements to 4-bit LLMs results in a 3-3.2x improvement in prompt processing and a 2x improvement in autoregressive decoding on Arm CPUs, compared to LLaMA.cpp-based solution. The optimized kernels are available at https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krisvarish V, Priyadarshini T, K P Abhishek Sri Saai, Vaidehi Vijayakumar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes a memory-efficient transformer model designed to drive a reduction in memory usage and execution time by substantial orders of magnitude without impairing the model's performance near that of the original model. Recently, new architectures of transformers were presented, focused on parameter efficiency and computational optimization; however, such models usually require considerable resources in terms of hardware when deployed in real-world applications on edge devices. This approach addresses this concern by halving embedding size and applying targeted techniques such as parameter pruning and quantization to optimize the memory footprint with minimum sacrifices in terms of accuracy. Experimental results include a 52% reduction in memory usage and a 33% decrease in execution time, resulting in better efficiency than state-of-the-art models. This work compared our model with existing compelling architectures, such as MobileBERT and DistilBERT, and proved its feasibility in the domain of resource-friendly deep learning architectures, mainly for applications in real-time and in resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juncheng Jiang, Dongdong Wan, Mengqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a combined approach to enhancing the effectiveness of Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in identifying fixed points within the 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation (KSE). JFNK approach entails a good initial guess for improved convergence when searching for fixed points. With a properly defined reward function, we utilise DRL as a preliminary step to enhance the initial guess in the converging process. We report new results of fixed points in the 2D KSE which have not been reported in the literature. Additionally, we explored control optimization for the 2D KSE to navigate the system trajectories between known fixed points, based on parallel reinforcement learning techniques. This combined method underscores the improved JFNK approach to finding new fixed-point solutions within the context of 2D KSE, which may be instructive for other high-dimensional dynamical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aidan Chadha</p>
<p>Abstract: Every year in the United States, 800,000 individuals suffer a stroke - one person every 40 seconds, with a death occurring every four minutes. While individual factors vary, certain predictors are more prevalent in determining stroke risk. As strokes are the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, predicting stroke likelihood based on lifestyle factors is crucial. Showing individuals their stroke risk could motivate lifestyle changes, and machine learning offers solutions to this prediction challenge. Neural networks excel at predicting outcomes based on training features like lifestyle factors, however, they're not the only option. Logistic regression models can also effectively compute the likelihood of binary outcomes based on independent variables, making them well-suited for stroke prediction. This analysis will compare both neural networks (dense and convolutional) and logistic regression models for stroke prediction, examining their pros, cons, and differences to develop the most effective predictor that minimizes false negatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Zheng Lin, Qinxuan Shi, Zhanglong Yang, Banafsheh Saber Latibari, Sicong Shao, Soheil Salehi, Pratik Satam</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach to simulate, predict, and optimize the behavior of physical systems, with applications that span manufacturing, healthcare, climate science, and more. However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical behaviors. We apply DDD-GenDT to the computer numerical control (CNC) machining process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of 10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and challenges that may arise in practical implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nianli Peng, Yilin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mean Field Control Games (MFCGs) provide a powerful theoretical framework for analyzing systems of infinitely many interacting agents, blending elements from Mean Field Games (MFGs) and Mean Field Control (MFC). However, solving the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations that characterize MFCG equilibria remains a significant computational challenge, particularly in high-dimensional or complex environments.
  This paper presents a scalable deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to approximate equilibrium solutions of MFCGs. Building on previous works, We reformulate the infinite-agent stochastic control problem as a Markov Decision Process, where each representative agent interacts with the evolving mean field distribution. We use the actor-critic based algorithm from a previous paper (Angiuli et.al., 2024) as the baseline and propose several versions of more scalable and efficient algorithms, utilizing techniques including parallel sample collection (batching); mini-batching; target network; proximal policy optimization (PPO); generalized advantage estimation (GAE); and entropy regularization. By leveraging these techniques, we effectively improved the efficiency, scalability, and training stability of the baseline algorithm.
  We evaluate our method on a linear-quadratic benchmark problem, where an analytical solution to the MFCG equilibrium is available. Our results show that some versions of our proposed approach achieve faster convergence and closely approximate the theoretical optimum, outperforming the baseline algorithm by an order of magnitude in sample efficiency. Our work lays the foundation for adapting deep RL to solve more complicated MFCGs closely related to real life, such as large-scale autonomous transportation systems, multi-firm economic competition, and inter-bank borrowing problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengnan Zhao, Lihe Zhang, Xingyi Yang, Tianhang Zheng, Baocai Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Security concerns surrounding text-to-image diffusion models have driven researchers to unlearn inappropriate concepts through fine-tuning. Recent fine-tuning methods typically align the prediction distributions of unsafe prompts with those of predefined text anchors. However, these techniques exhibit a considerable performance trade-off between eliminating undesirable concepts and preserving other concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose AdvAnchor, a novel approach that generates adversarial anchors to alleviate the trade-off issue. These adversarial anchors are crafted to closely resemble the embeddings of undesirable concepts to maintain overall model performance, while selectively excluding defining attributes of these concepts for effective erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AdvAnchor.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00056">Transforming CCTV cameras into NO$_2$ sensors at city scale for adaptive policymaking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed R. Ibrahim, Terry Lyons</p>
<p>Abstract: Air pollution in cities, especially NO\textsubscript{2}, is linked to numerous health problems, ranging from mortality to mental health challenges and attention deficits in children. While cities globally have initiated policies to curtail emissions, real-time monitoring remains challenging due to limited environmental sensors and their inconsistent distribution. This gap hinders the creation of adaptive urban policies that respond to the sequence of events and daily activities affecting pollution in cities. Here, we demonstrate how city CCTV cameras can act as a pseudo-NO\textsubscript{2} sensors. Using a predictive graph deep model, we utilised traffic flow from London's cameras in addition to environmental and spatial factors, generating NO\textsubscript{2} predictions from over 133 million frames. Our analysis of London's mobility patterns unveiled critical spatiotemporal connections, showing how specific traffic patterns affect NO\textsubscript{2} levels, sometimes with temporal lags of up to 6 hours. For instance, if trucks only drive at night, their effects on NO\textsubscript{2} levels are most likely to be seen in the morning when people commute. These findings cast doubt on the efficacy of some of the urban policies currently being implemented to reduce pollution. By leveraging existing camera infrastructure and our introduced methods, city planners and policymakers could cost-effectively monitor and mitigate the impact of NO\textsubscript{2} and other pollutants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Witold Wydma\'nski, Ulvi Movsum-zada, Jacek Tabor, Marek \'Smieja</p>
<p>Abstract: Although deep learning models have had great success in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not observe comparable improvements in the case of tabular data, which is still the most common data type used in biological, industrial and financial applications. In particular, it is challenging to transfer large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks defined on small tabular datasets. To address this, we propose VisTabNet -- a cross-modal transfer learning method, which allows for adapting Vision Transformer (ViT) with pre-trained weights to process tabular data. By projecting tabular inputs to patch embeddings acceptable by ViT, we can directly apply a pre-trained Transformer Encoder to tabular inputs. This approach eliminates the conceptual cost of designing a suitable architecture for processing tabular data, while reducing the computational cost of training the model from scratch. Experimental results on multiple small tabular datasets (less than 1k samples) demonstrate VisTabNet's superiority, outperforming both traditional ensemble methods and recent deep learning models. The proposed method goes beyond conventional transfer learning practice and shows that pre-trained image models can be transferred to solve tabular problems, extending the boundaries of transfer learning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00061">Training-free Heterogeneous Model Merging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengqi Xu, Han Zheng, Jie Song, Li Sun, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has attracted significant attention as a powerful paradigm for model reuse, facilitating the integration of task-specific models into a singular, versatile framework endowed with multifarious capabilities. Previous studies, predominantly utilizing methods such as Weight Average (WA), have shown that model merging can effectively leverage pretrained models without the need for laborious retraining. However, the inherent heterogeneity among models poses a substantial constraint on its applicability, particularly when confronted with discrepancies in model architectures. To overcome this challenge, we propose an innovative model merging framework designed for heterogeneous models, encompassing both depth and width heterogeneity. To address depth heterogeneity, we introduce a layer alignment strategy that harmonizes model layers by segmenting deeper models, treating consecutive layers with similar representations as a cohesive segment, thus enabling the seamless merging of models with differing layer depths. For width heterogeneity, we propose a novel elastic neuron zipping algorithm that projects the weights from models of varying widths onto a common dimensional space, eliminating the need for identical widths. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of these proposed methods, demonstrating that the merging of structurally heterogeneous models can achieve performance levels comparable to those of homogeneous merging, across both vision and NLP tasks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00063">&quot;Generative Models for Financial Time Series Data: Enhancing Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Addressing Data Scarcity in A-Share Market</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Che</p>
<p>Abstract: The financial industry is increasingly seeking robust methods to address the challenges posed by data scarcity and low signal-to-noise ratios, which limit the application of deep learning techniques in stock market analysis. This paper presents two innovative generative model-based approaches to synthesize stock data, specifically tailored for different scenarios within the A-share market in China. The first method, a sector-based synthesis approach, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of stock data by classifying the characteristics of stocks from various sectors in China's A-share market. This method employs an Approximate Non-Local Total Variation algorithm to smooth the generated data, a bandpass filtering method based on Fourier Transform to eliminate noise, and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models to accelerate sampling speed. The second method, a recursive stock data synthesis approach based on pattern recognition, is designed to synthesize data for stocks with short listing periods and limited comparable companies. It leverages pattern recognition techniques and Markov models to learn and generate variable-length stock sequences, while introducing a sub-time-level data augmentation method to alleviate data scarcity issues.We validate the effectiveness of these methods through extensive experiments on various datasets, including those from the main board, STAR Market, Growth Enterprise Market Board, Beijing Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX. The results demonstrate that our synthesized data not only improve the performance of predictive models but also enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of individual stock signals in price trading strategies. Furthermore, the introduction of sub-time-level data significantly improves the quality of synthesized data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Yu Ji, Cong Xia, Wen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Predicting children's future levels of externalizing problems helps to identify children at risk and guide targeted prevention. Existing studies have shown that mothers providing support in response to children's dysregulation was associated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems. The current study aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy of predicting children's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction dynamics. Method: This study used mother-child interaction dynamics during a challenging puzzle task to predict children's externalizing problems six months later (N=101, 46 boys, Mage=57.41 months, SD=6.58). Performance of the Residual Dynamic Structural Equation Model (RDSEM) was compared with the Attention-based Sequential Behavior Interaction Modeling (ASBIM) model, developed using the deep learning techniques. Results: The RDSEM revealed that children whose mothers provided more autonomy support after increases of child defeat had lower levels of externalizing problems. Five-fold cross-validation showed that the RDSEM had good prediction accuracy. The ASBIM model further improved prediction accuracy, especially after including child inhibitory control as a personalized individual feature. Conclusions: The dynamic process of mother-child interaction provides important information for predicting children's externalizing problems, especially maternal autonomy supportive response to child defeat. The deep learning model is a useful tool to further improve prediction accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hefei Li, Chao Peng, Chenyang Xu, Zhengfeng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning is an emerging area of machine learning that focuses on building neural networks capable of solving complex algorithmic tasks. Recent advancements predominantly follow the standard supervised learning paradigm -- feeding an individual problem instance into the network each time and training it to approximate the execution steps of a classical algorithm. We challenge this mode and propose a novel open-book learning framework. In this framework, whether during training or testing, the network can access and utilize all instances in the training dataset when reasoning for a given instance.
  Empirical evaluation is conducted on the challenging CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, which consists of 30 diverse algorithmic tasks. Our open-book learning framework exhibits a significant enhancement in neural reasoning capabilities. Further, we notice that there is recent literature suggesting that multi-task training on CLRS can improve the reasoning accuracy of certain tasks, implying intrinsic connections between different algorithmic tasks. We delve into this direction via the open-book framework. When the network reasons for a specific task, we enable it to aggregate information from training instances of other tasks in an attention-based manner. We show that this open-book attention mechanism offers insights into the inherent relationships among various tasks in the benchmark and provides a robust tool for interpretable multi-task training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungsik Hwang, Ahmadreza Ahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to generate and recognize sequential data is fundamental for autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments. Inspired by the key principles of the brain-predictive coding and the Bayesian brain-we propose a novel stochastic Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Biases (RNNPB). The proposed model incorporates stochasticity into the latent space using the reparameterization trick used in variational autoencoders. This approach enables the model to learn probabilistic representations of multidimensional sequences, capturing uncertainty and enhancing robustness against overfitting. We tested the proposed model on a robotic motion dataset to assess its performance in generating and recognizing temporal patterns. The experimental results showed that the stochastic RNNPB model outperformed its deterministic counterpart in generating and recognizing motion sequences. The results highlighted the proposed model's capability to quantify and adjust uncertainty during both learning and inference. The stochasticity resulted in a continuous latent space representation, facilitating stable motion generation and enhanced generalization when recognizing novel sequences. Our approach provides a biologically inspired framework for modeling temporal patterns and advances the development of robust and adaptable systems in artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krish Jain, Joann Sum, Pranav Kapoor, Amir Eaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a robust security mechanism that enforces mandatory access controls (MAC), but its policy language's complexity creates challenges for policy analysis and management. This research investigates the automation of SELinux policy analysis using graph-based techniques combined with machine learning approaches to detect policy anomalies. The study addresses two key questions: Can SELinux policy analysis be automated through graph analysis, and how do different anomaly detection models compare in analyzing SELinux policies? We will be comparing different machine learning models by evaluating their effectiveness in detecting policy violations and anomalies. Our approach utilizes Neo4j for graph representation of policies, with Node2vec transforming these graph structures into meaningful vector embeddings that can be processed by our machine learning models. In our results, the MLP Neural Network consistently demonstrated superior performance across different dataset sizes, achieving 95% accuracy with balanced precision and recall metrics, while both Random Forest and SVM models showed competitive but slightly lower performance in detecting policy violations. This combination of graph-based modeling and machine learning provides a more sophisticated and automated approach to understanding and analyzing complex SELinux policies compared to traditional manual analysis methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00107">An Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Electricity Consumption Using Reinforcement Learning and Time Series Forest Based Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihan Ghanim, Mariette Awad</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a crucial role in time series applications, primarily because time series data is employed across real-world scenarios. Detecting anomalies poses significant challenges since anomalies take diverse forms making them hard to pinpoint accurately. Previous research has explored different AD models, making specific assumptions with varying sensitivity toward particular anomaly types. To address this issue, we propose a novel model selection for unsupervised AD using a combination of time series forest (TSF) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that dynamically chooses an AD technique. Our approach allows for effective AD without explicitly depending on ground truth labels that are often scarce and expensive to obtain. Results from the real-time series dataset demonstrate that the proposed model selection approach outperforms all other AD models in terms of the F1 score metric. For the synthetic dataset, our proposed model surpasses all other AD models except for KNN, with an impressive F1 score of 0.989. The proposed model selection framework also exceeded the performance of GPT-4 when prompted to act as an anomaly detector on the synthetic dataset. Exploring different reward functions revealed that the original reward function in our proposed AD model selection approach yielded the best overall scores. We evaluated the performance of the six AD models on an additional three datasets, having global, local, and clustered anomalies respectively, showing that each AD model exhibited distinct performance depending on the type of anomalies. This emphasizes the significance of our proposed AD model selection framework, maintaining high performance across all datasets, and showcasing superior performance across different anomaly types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kleanthis Malialis, Nefeli Mavri, Stelios G. Vrachimis, Marios S. Kyriakou, Demetrios G. Eliades, Marios M. Polycarpou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate water consumption forecasting is a crucial tool for water utilities and policymakers, as it helps ensure a reliable supply, optimize operations, and support infrastructure planning. Urban Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are divided into District Metered Areas (DMAs), where water flow is monitored to efficiently manage resources. This work focuses on short-term forecasting of DMA consumption using deep learning and aims to address two key challenging issues. First, forecasting based solely on a DMA's historical data may lack broader context and provide limited insights. Second, DMAs may experience sensor malfunctions providing incorrect data, or some DMAs may not be monitored at all due to computational costs, complicating accurate forecasting. We propose a novel method that first identifies DMAs with correlated consumption patterns and then uses these patterns, along with the DMA's local data, as input to a deep learning model for forecasting. In a real-world study with data from five DMAs, we show that: i) the deep learning model outperforms a classical statistical model; ii) accurate forecasting can be carried out using only correlated DMAs' consumption patterns; and iii) even when a DMA's local data is available, including correlated DMAs' data improves accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akul Goyal, Carl Edwards</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing work within transfer learning often follows a two-step process -- pre-training over a large-scale source domain and then finetuning over limited samples from the target domain. Yet, despite its popularity, this methodology has been shown to suffer in the presence of distributional shift -- specifically when the output spaces diverge. Previous work has focused on increasing model performance within this setting by identifying and classifying only the shared output classes between distributions. However, these methods are inherently limited as they ignore classes outside the shared class set, disregarding potential information relevant to the model transfer. This paper proposes a new process for few-shot transfer learning that selects and weighs classes from the source domain to optimize the transfer between domains. More concretely, we use Wasserstein distance to choose a set of source classes and their weights that minimize the distance between the source and target domain. To justify our proposed algorithm, we provide a generalization analysis of the performance of the learned classifier over the target domain and show that our method corresponds to a bound minimization algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (WaSS) by experimenting on several different datasets and presenting superior performance within various label shift settings, including the extreme case where the label spaces are disjoint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongrui Shi, Valentin Radu, Po Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid expansion of edge devices, such as IoT devices, where crucial data needed for machine learning applications is generated, it becomes essential to promote their participation in privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) systems. The best way to achieve this desiderate is by reducing their training workload to match their constrained computational resources. While prior FL research has address the workload constrains by introducing lightweight models on the edge, limited attention has been given to optimizing on-device training efficiency through reducing the amount of data need during training. In this work, we propose FedFT-EDS, a novel approach that combines Fine-Tuning of partial client models with Entropy-based Data Selection to reduce training workloads on edge devices. By actively selecting the most informative local instances for learning, FedFT-EDS reduces training data significantly in FL and demonstrates that not all user data is equally beneficial for FL on all rounds. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that FedFT-EDS uses only 50% user data while improving the global model performance compared to baseline methods, FedAvg and FedProx. Importantly, FedFT-EDS improves client learning efficiency by up to 3 times, using one third of training time on clients to achieve an equivalent performance to the baselines. This work highlights the importance of data selection in FL and presents a promising pathway to scalable and efficient Federate Learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Nadiri, Jing Li, Ali Faraji, Ghadeer Abuoda, Manos Papagelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changchang Yin, Shihan Fu, Bingsheng Yao, Thai-Hoang Pham, Weidan Cao, Dakuo Wang, Jeffrey Caterino, Ping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis is an organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated immune response to an infection. Early sepsis prediction and identification allow for timely intervention, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Clinical calculators (e.g., the six-organ dysfunction assessment of SOFA) play a vital role in sepsis identification within clinicians' workflow, providing evidence-based risk assessments essential for sepsis diagnosis. However, artificial intelligence (AI) sepsis prediction models typically generate a single sepsis risk score without incorporating clinical calculators for assessing organ dysfunctions, making the models less convincing and transparent to clinicians. To bridge the gap, we propose to mimic clinicians' workflow with a novel framework SepsisCalc to integrate clinical calculators into the predictive model, yielding a clinically transparent and precise model for utilization in clinical settings. Practically, clinical calculators usually combine information from multiple component variables in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and might not be applicable when the variables are (partially) missing. We mitigate this issue by representing EHRs as temporal graphs and integrating a learning module to dynamically add the accurately estimated calculator to the graphs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sepsis prediction tasks. Moreover, we developed a system to identify organ dysfunctions and potential sepsis risks, providing a human-AI interaction tool for deployment, which can help clinicians understand the prediction outputs and prepare timely interventions for the corresponding dysfunctions, paving the way for actionable clinical decision-making support for early intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaoyi Fang, Weiyu Du, Hang Wang, Junshan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: World models have recently emerged as a promising approach to reinforcement learning (RL), achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of visual control tasks. This work aims to obtain a deep understanding of the robustness and generalization capabilities of world models. Thus motivated, we develop a stochastic differential equation formulation by treating the world model learning as a stochastic dynamical system, and characterize the impact of latent representation errors on robustness and generalization, for both cases with zero-drift representation errors and with non-zero-drift representation errors. Our somewhat surprising findings, based on both theoretic and experimental studies, reveal that for the case with zero drift, modest latent representation errors can in fact function as implicit regularization and hence result in improved robustness. We further propose a Jacobian regularization scheme to mitigate the compounding error propagation effects of non-zero drift, thereby enhancing training stability and robustness. Our experimental studies corroborate that this regularization approach not only stabilizes training but also accelerates convergence and improves accuracy of long-horizon prediction.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00200">Scalable Neural Network Verification with Branch-and-bound Inferred Cutting Planes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Zhou, Christopher Brix, Grani A Hanasusanto, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, cutting-plane methods such as GCP-CROWN have been explored to enhance neural network verifiers and made significant advances. However, GCP-CROWN currently relies on generic cutting planes (cuts) generated from external mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. Due to the poor scalability of MIP solvers, large neural networks cannot benefit from these cutting planes. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the neural network verification problem to generate efficient and scalable cutting planes specific for this problem setting. We propose a novel approach, Branch-and-bound Inferred Cuts with COnstraint Strengthening (BICCOS), which leverages the logical relationships of neurons within verified subproblems in the branch-and-bound search tree, and we introduce cuts that preclude these relationships in other subproblems. We develop a mechanism that assigns influence scores to neurons in each path to allow the strengthening of these cuts. Furthermore, we design a multi-tree search technique to identify more cuts, effectively narrowing the search space and accelerating the BaB algorithm. Our results demonstrate that BICCOS can generate hundreds of useful cuts during the branch-and-bound process and consistently increase the number of verifiable instances compared to other state-of-the-art neural network verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks, including large networks that previous cutting plane methods could not scale to. BICCOS is part of the $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN verifier, the VNN-COMP 2024 winner. The code is available at http://github.com/Lemutisme/BICCOS .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Zhang, Ruojia Feng, Yifei Wang, Xuequn Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces FDSC, a private-protected subspace clustering (SC) approach with federated learning (FC) schema. In each client, there is a deep subspace clustering network accounting for grouping the isolated data, composed of a encode network, a self-expressive layer, and a decode network. FDSC is achieved by uploading the encode network to communicate with other clients in the server. Besides, FDSC is also enhanced by preserving the local neighborhood relationship in each client. With the effects of federated learning and locality preservation, the learned data features from the encoder are boosted so as to enhance the self-expressiveness learning and result in better clustering performance. Experiments test FDSC on public datasets and compare with other clustering methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of FDSC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Zhang, Deqiang Ouyang, Shuang Liang, Jie Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting missing facts for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) is a fundamental task, called temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC). One key challenge in this task is the imbalance in data distribution, where facts are unevenly spread across entities and timestamps. This imbalance can lead to poor completion performance or long-tail entities and timestamps, and unstable training due to the introduction of false negative samples. Unfortunately, few previous studies have investigated how to mitigate these effects. Moreover, for the first time, we found that existing methods suffer from model preferences, revealing that entities with specific properties (e.g., recently active) are favored by different models. Such preferences will lead to error accumulation and further exacerbate the effects of imbalanced data distribution, but are overlooked by previous studies. To alleviate the impacts of imbalanced data and model preferences, we introduce Booster, the first data augmentation strategy for TKGs. The unique requirements here lie in generating new samples that fit the complex semantic and temporal patterns within TKGs, and identifying hard-learning samples specific to models. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical scoring algorithm based on triadic closures within TKGs. By incorporating both global semantic patterns and local time-aware structures, the algorithm enables pattern-aware validation for new samples. Meanwhile, we propose a two-stage training approach to identify samples that deviate from the model's preferred patterns. With a well-designed frequency-based filtering strategy, this approach also helps to avoid the misleading of false negatives. Experiments justify that Booster can seamlessly adapt to existing TKGC models and achieve up to an 8.7% performance improvement.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00265">Outlier-Robust Training of Machine Learning Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajat Talak, Charis Georgiou, Jingnan Shi, Luca Carlone</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust training of machine learning models in the presence of outliers has garnered attention across various domains. The use of robust losses is a popular approach and is known to mitigate the impact of outliers. We bring to light two literatures that have diverged in their ways of designing robust losses: one using M-estimation, which is popular in robotics and computer vision, and another using a risk-minimization framework, which is popular in deep learning. We first show that a simple modification of the Black-Rangarajan duality provides a unifying view. The modified duality brings out a definition of a robust loss kernel $\sigma$ that is satisfied by robust losses in both the literatures. Secondly, using the modified duality, we propose an Adaptive Alternation Algorithm (AAA) for training machine learning models with outliers. The algorithm iteratively trains the model by using a weighted version of the non-robust loss, while updating the weights at each iteration. The algorithm is augmented with a novel parameter update rule by interpreting the weights as inlier probabilities, and obviates the need for complex parameter tuning. Thirdly, we investigate convergence of the adaptive alternation algorithm to outlier-free optima. Considering arbitrary outliers (i.e., with no distributional assumption on the outliers), we show that the use of robust loss kernels {\sigma} increases the region of convergence. We experimentally show the efficacy of our algorithm on regression, classification, and neural scene reconstruction problems. We release our implementation code: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/ORT.</p>

For applications like this, adaptability and scalability are important issues. This is why ReFormer leverages transformer-based autoregressive generation, trained on learned discrete representations of RF signals. By using prompts, such GAI can be made to generate the data which complies with specific constraints or conditions, particularly useful for training channel estimation and modeling. It may also leverage the data from a source system to generate training data for a target system. We show how different transformer architectures and other design choices affect the quality of generated RF fakes, evaluated using metrics such as precision and recall, classification accuracy and signal constellation diagrams.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00305">diffIRM: A Diffusion-Augmented Invariant Risk Minimization Framework for Spatiotemporal Prediction over Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaobin Mo, Haotian Xiang, Xuan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction over graphs (STPG) is challenging, because real-world data suffers from the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where test data follow different distributions from training ones. To address this issue, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has emerged as a promising approach for learning invariant representations across different environments. However, IRM and its variants are originally designed for Euclidean data like images, and may not generalize well to graph-structure data such as spatiotemporal graphs due to spatial correlations in graphs. To overcome the challenge posed by graph-structure data, the existing graph OOD methods adhere to the principles of invariance existence, or environment diversity. However, there is little research that combines both principles in the STPG problem. A combination of the two is crucial for efficiently distinguishing between invariant features and spurious ones. In this study, we fill in this research gap and propose a diffusion-augmented invariant risk minimization (diffIRM) framework that combines these two principles for the STPG problem. Our diffIRM contains two processes: i) data augmentation and ii) invariant learning. In the data augmentation process, a causal mask generator identifies causal features and a graph-based diffusion model acts as an environment augmentor to generate augmented spatiotemporal graph data. In the invariant learning process, an invariance penalty is designed using the augmented data, and then serves as a regularizer for training the spatiotemporal prediction model. The real-world experiment uses three human mobility datasets, i.e. SafeGraph, PeMS04, and PeMS08. Our proposed diffIRM outperforms baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixuan Li, Can Chen, Jiajun Li, Jiahui Duan, Xiongwei Han, Tao Zhong, Vincent Chau, Weiwei Wu, Wanyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: By exploiting the correlation between the structure and the solution of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Machine Learning (ML) has become a promising method for solving large-scale MILP problems. Existing ML-based MILP solvers mainly focus on end-to-end solution learning, which suffers from the scalability issue due to the high dimensionality of the solution space. Instead of directly learning the optimal solution, this paper aims to learn a reduced and equivalent model of the original MILP as an intermediate step. The reduced model often corresponds to interpretable operations and is much simpler, enabling us to solve large-scale MILP problems much faster than existing commercial solvers. However, current approaches rely only on the optimal reduced model, overlooking the significant preference information of all reduced models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a preference-based model reduction learning method, which considers the relative performance (i.e., objective cost and constraint feasibility) of all reduced models on each MILP instance as preferences. We also introduce an attention mechanism to capture and represent preference information, which helps improve the performance of model reduction learning tasks. Moreover, we propose a SetCover based pruning method to control the number of reduced models (i.e., labels), thereby simplifying the learning process. Evaluation on real-world MILP problems shows that 1) compared to the state-of-the-art model reduction ML methods, our method obtains nearly 20% improvement on solution accuracy, and 2) compared to the commercial solver Gurobi, two to four orders of magnitude speedups are achieved.</p>

<p>Abstract: Malicious URL (Uniform Resource Locator) classification is a pivotal aspect of Cybersecurity, offering defense against web-based threats. Despite deep learning's promise in this area, its advancement is hindered by two main challenges: the scarcity of comprehensive, open-source datasets and the limitations of existing models, which either lack real-time capabilities or exhibit suboptimal performance. In order to address these gaps, we introduce a novel, multi-class dataset for malicious URL classification, distinguishing between benign, phishing and malicious URLs, named DeepURLBench. The data has been rigorously cleansed and structured, providing a superior alternative to existing datasets. Notably, the multi-class approach enhances the performance of deep learning models, as compared to a standard binary classification approach. Additionally, we propose improvements to string-based URL classifiers, applying these enhancements to URLNet. Key among these is the integration of DNS-derived features, which enrich the model's capabilities and lead to notable performance gains while preserving real-time runtime efficiency-achieving an effective balance for cybersecurity applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijing Xie, Dingzhu Wen, Xiaonan Liu, Changsheng You, Tharmalingam Ratnarajah, Kaibin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Dropout is an efficient technique to overcome both communication and computation bottlenecks for deploying federated learning at the network edge. In each training round, an edge device only needs to update and transmit a sub-model, which is generated by the typical method of dropout in deep learning, and thus effectively reduces the per-round latency. \textcolor{blue}{However, the theoretical convergence analysis for Federated Dropout is still lacking in the literature, particularly regarding the quantitative influence of dropout rate on convergence}. To address this issue, by using the Taylor expansion method, we mathematically show that the gradient variance increases with a scaling factor of $\gamma/(1-\gamma)$, with $\gamma \in [0, \theta)$ denoting the dropout rate and $\theta$ being the maximum dropout rate ensuring the loss function reduction. Based on the above approximation, we provide the convergence analysis for Federated Dropout. Specifically, it is shown that a larger dropout rate of each device leads to a slower convergence rate. This provides a theoretical foundation for reducing the convergence latency by making a tradeoff between the per-round latency and the overall rounds till convergence. Moreover, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the dropout rate and the bandwidth allocation for minimizing the loss function in all rounds under a given per-round latency and limited network resources. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p>Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, aligning their decision-making to human preferences is essential. In domains like autonomous driving or robotics, it is impossible to write down the reward function representing these preferences by hand. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer the unknown reward from demonstrations. However, obtaining human demonstrations can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration, reducing the amount of required human effort. Where most prior work allowed querying the human for an action at one state at a time, we motivate and analyse scenarios where we collect longer trajectories. We provide an information-theoretic acquisition function, propose an efficient approximation scheme, and illustrate its performance through a set of gridworld experiments as groundwork for future work expanding to more general settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenkai Tu, Guojia Wan, Zhengchun Shang, Bo Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a structured representation of knowledge but often suffer from challenges of incompleteness. To address this, link prediction or knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing new facts based on existing facts in KGs. Previous knowledge graph embedding models are limited in their ability to capture expressive features, especially when compared to deeper, multi-layer models. These approaches also assign a single static embedding to each entity and relation, disregarding the fact that entities and relations can exhibit different behaviors in varying graph contexts. Due to complex context over a fact triple of a KG, existing methods have to leverage complex non-linear context encoder, like transformer, to project entity and relation into low dimensional representations, resulting in high computation cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Triple Receptance Perception (TRP) architecture to model sequential information, enabling the learning of dynamic context of entities and relations. Then we use tensor decomposition to calculate triple scores, providing robust relational decoding capabilities. This integration allows for more expressive representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as YAGO3-10, UMLS, FB15k, and FB13 in link prediction and triple classification tasks demonstrate that our method performs better than several state-of-the-art models, proving the effectiveness of the integration.</p>

A key phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization - where a strong model trained on a weak model's outputs surpasses the weak model in task performance - has gained significant attention. Yet, whether critical trustworthiness properties such as robustness, fairness, and privacy can generalize similarly remains an open question. In this work, we study this question by examining if a stronger model can inherit trustworthiness properties when fine-tuned on a weaker model's outputs, a process we term weak-to-strong trustworthiness generalization. To address this, we introduce two foundational training strategies: 1) Weak Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak TFT), which leverages trustworthiness regularization during the fine-tuning of the weak model, and 2) Weak and Weak-to-Strong Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak+WTS TFT), which extends regularization to both weak and strong models. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets reveals that while some trustworthiness properties, such as fairness, adversarial, and OOD robustness, show significant improvement in transfer when both models were regularized, others like privacy do not exhibit signs of weak-to-strong trustworthiness. As the first study to explore trustworthiness generalization via weak-to-strong generalization, our work provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of weak-to-strong generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangchen Yu, Ruilizhen Hu, Yidong Lin, Yuqi Ma, Zhenghao Huang, Wenye Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has recently gained attention as an alternative to traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), offering improved accuracy and interpretability by employing learnable activation functions on edges. In this paper, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Auto-Encoder (KAE), which integrates KAN with autoencoders (AEs) to enhance representation learning for retrieval, classification, and denoising tasks. Leveraging the flexible polynomial functions in KAN layers, KAE captures complex data patterns and non-linear relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KAE improves latent representation quality, reduces reconstruction errors, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as retrieval, classification, and denoising, compared to standard autoencoders and other KAN variants. These results suggest KAE's potential as a useful tool for representation learning. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/SciYu/KAE/}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwuk Seok, Changsik Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an intuitive analysis of the optimization technique based on the quantization of an objective function. Quantization of an objective function is an effective optimization methodology that decreases the measure of a level set containing several saddle points and local minima and finds the optimal point at the limit level set. To investigate the dynamics of quantization-based optimization, we derive an overdamped Langevin dynamics model from an intuitive analysis to minimize the level set by iterative quantization. We claim that quantization-based optimization involves the quantities of thermodynamical and quantum mechanical optimization as the core methodologies of global optimization. Furthermore, on the basis of the proposed SDE, we provide thermodynamic and quantum mechanical analysis with Witten-Laplacian. The simulation results with the benchmark functions, which compare the performance of the nonlinear optimization, demonstrate the validity of the quantization-based optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhan Huang, Tejaswini Pedapati, Pin-Yu Chen, Jianxi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt learning is an effective way to exploit the potential of large-scale pre-trained foundational models. Continuous prompts parameterize context tokens in prompts by turning them into differentiable vectors. Deep continuous prompts insert prompts not only in the input but also in the intermediate hidden representations. Manually designed deep continuous prompts exhibit a remarkable improvement compared to the zero-shot pre-trained model on downstream tasks. How to automate the continuous prompt design is an underexplored area, and a fundamental question arises, is manually designed deep prompt strategy optimal? To answer this question, we propose a method dubbed differentiable prompt learning (DPL). The DPL method is formulated as an optimization problem to automatically determine the optimal context length of the prompt to be added to each layer, where the objective is to maximize the performance. We test the DPL method on the pre-trained CLIP. We empirically find that by using only limited data, our DPL method can find deep continuous prompt configuration with high confidence. The performance on the downstream tasks exhibits the superiority of the automatic design: our method boosts the average test accuracy by 2.60% on 11 datasets compared to baseline methods. Besides, our method focuses only on the prompt configuration (i.e. context length for each layer), which means that our method is compatible with the baseline methods that have sophisticated designs to boost the performance. The DPL method can be deployed to large language models or computer vision models at no cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Zhang, Liang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated images necessitates effective watermarking to protect intellectual property and identify fake content. While existing training-based watermarking methods show promise, they often struggle with generalization across diverse prompts and tend to produce noticeable artifacts. To this end, we introduce a provably generalizable image watermarking method for Latent Diffusion Models with Self-Augmented Training (SAT-LDM), which aligns the training and testing phases by a free generation distribution to bolster the watermarking module's generalization capabilities. We theoretically consolidate our method by proving that the free generation distribution contributes to its tight generalization bound without the need to collect new data. Extensive experimental results show that SAT-LDM achieves robust watermarking while significantly improving the quality of watermarked images across diverse prompts. Furthermore, we conduct experimental analyses to demonstrate the strong generalization abilities of SAT-LDM. We hope our method offers a practical and convenient solution for securing high-fidelity AI-generated content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiswendsida Kisito Kabore, Desire Guel</p>
<p>Abstract: Malaria remains a significant global health burden, particularly in resource-limited regions where timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to effective treatment and control. Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative tool for automating malaria detection and it offers high accuracy and scalability. However, the effectiveness of these models is constrained by challenges in data quality and model generalization including imbalanced datasets, limited diversity and annotation variability. These issues reduce diagnostic reliability and hinder real-world applicability.
  This article provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and their implications for malaria detection performance. Key findings highlight the impact of data imbalances which can lead to a 20\% drop in F1-score and regional biases which significantly hinder model generalization. Proposed solutions, such as GAN-based augmentation, improved accuracy by 15-20\% by generating synthetic data to balance classes and enhance dataset diversity. Domain adaptation techniques, including transfer learning, further improved cross-domain robustness by up to 25\% in sensitivity.
  Additionally, the development of diverse global datasets and collaborative data-sharing frameworks is emphasized as a cornerstone for equitable and reliable malaria diagnostics. The role of explainable AI techniques in improving clinical adoption and trustworthiness is also underscored. By addressing these challenges, this work advances the field of AI-driven malaria detection and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. The proposed solutions aim to support the development of accessible and accurate diagnostic tools, particularly for resource-constrained populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saugat Kannojia, Anirudh Praveen, Danish Vasdev, Saket Nandedkar, Divyansh Mittal, Sarthak Kalankar, Shaurya Johari, Vipul Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Dementia is a neurodegenerative disease that causes gradual cognitive impairment, which is very common in the world and undergoes a lot of research every year to prevent and cure it. It severely impacts the patient's ability to remember events and communicate clearly, where most variations of it have no known cure, but early detection can help alleviate symptoms before they become worse. One of the main symptoms of dementia is difficulty in expressing ideas through speech. This paper attempts to talk about a model developed to predict the onset of the disease using audio recordings from patients. An ASR-based model was developed that generates transcripts from the audio files using Whisper model and then applies RoBERTa regression model to generate an MMSE score for the patient. This score can be used to predict the extent to which the cognitive ability of a patient has been affected. We use the PROCESS_V1 dataset for this task, which is introduced through the PROCESS Grand Challenge 2025. The model achieved an RMSE score of 2.6911 which is around 10 percent lower than the described baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Aloui, Ali Hasan, Juncheng Dong, Zihao Wu, Vahid Tarokh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach for integrating score-based models with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. While traditional score-based diffusion models excel in accurately learning the score function from data points, they lack an energy function, making the Metropolis-Hastings adjustment step inaccessible. Consequently, the unadjusted Langevin algorithm is often used for sampling using estimated score functions. The lack of an energy function then prevents the application of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and other Metropolis-Hastings methods, limiting the wealth of other algorithms developed that use acceptance functions. We address this limitation by introducing a new loss function based on the \emph{detailed balance condition}, allowing the estimation of the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities given a learned score function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for various scenarios, including sampling from heavy-tail distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miro Miranda, Marcela Charfuelan, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to climate change, assessing crop productivity under extreme weather conditions is essential to enhance food security. Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes, offer explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning (ML) models for crop modeling are powerful and scalable yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growths physical principles. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function. Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yield data, our model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00508">Active Learning of General Halfspaces: Label Queries vs Membership Queries</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Mingchen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning general (i.e., not necessarily homogeneous) halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution on $R^d$ in the presence of some form of query access. In the classical pool-based active learning model, where the algorithm is allowed to make adaptive label queries to previously sampled points, we establish a strong information-theoretic lower bound ruling out non-trivial improvements over the passive setting. Specifically, we show that any active learner requires label complexity of $\tilde{\Omega}(d/(\log(m)\epsilon))$, where $m$ is the number of unlabeled examples. Specifically, to beat the passive label complexity of $\tilde{O} (d/\epsilon)$, an active learner requires a pool of $2^{poly(d)}$ unlabeled samples. On the positive side, we show that this lower bound can be circumvented with membership query access, even in the agnostic model. Specifically, we give a computationally efficient learner with query complexity of $\tilde{O}(\min\{1/p, 1/\epsilon\} + d\cdot polylog(1/\epsilon))$ achieving error guarantee of $O(opt)+\epsilon$. Here $p \in [0, 1/2]$ is the bias and $opt$ is the 0-1 loss of the optimal halfspace. As a corollary, we obtain a strong separation between the active and membership query models. Taken together, our results characterize the complexity of learning general halfspaces under Gaussian marginals in these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiseok Chae, Chulhee Yun, Donghwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In minimax optimization, the extragradient (EG) method has been extensively studied because it outperforms the gradient descent-ascent method in convex-concave (C-C) problems. Yet, stochastic EG (SEG) has seen limited success in C-C problems, especially for unconstrained cases. Motivated by the recent progress of shuffling-based stochastic methods, we investigate the convergence of shuffling-based SEG in unconstrained finite-sum minimax problems, in search of convergent shuffling-based SEG. Our analysis reveals that both random reshuffling and the recently proposed flip-flop shuffling alone can suffer divergence in C-C problems. However, with an additional simple trick called anchoring, we develop the SEG with flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA) method which successfully converges in C-C problems. We also show upper and lower bounds in the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setting, demonstrating that SEG-FFA has a provably faster convergence rate compared to other shuffling-based methods.</p>

Current formats, such as pickle and other binary formats, have significant problems, such as reliability, safety, and transparency issues. In contrast, PyMilo serializes ML models in a transparent non-executable format, enabling straightforward and safe model exchange, while also facilitating the deserialization and deployment of exported models in production environments. This package aims to provide a seamless, end-to-end solution for the exportation and importation of pre-trained ML models, which simplifies the model development and deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dropout is an effective strategy for the regularization of deep neural networks. Applying tabu to the units that have been dropped in the recent epoch and retaining them for training ensures diversification in dropout. In this paper, we improve the Tabu Dropout mechanism for training deep neural networks in two ways. Firstly, we propose to use tabu tenure, or the number of epochs a particular unit will not be dropped. Different tabu tenures provide diversification to boost the training of deep neural networks based on the search landscape. Secondly, we propose an adaptive tabu algorithm that automatically selects the tabu tenure based on the training performances through epochs. On several standard benchmark datasets, the experimental results show that the adaptive tabu dropout and tabu tenure dropout diversify and perform significantly better compared to the standard dropout and basic tabu dropout mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harit Vishwakarma, Alan Mishler, Thomas Cook, Niccol\`o Dalmasso, Natraj Raman, Sumitra Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are empowering decision-making in several applications, including tool or API usage and answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, they often make overconfident, incorrect predictions, which can be risky in high-stakes settings like healthcare and finance. To mitigate these risks, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. CP transforms a \emph{score function} into prediction sets that contain the true answer with high probability. While CP provides this coverage guarantee for arbitrary scores, the score quality significantly impacts prediction set sizes. Prior works have relied on LLM logits or other heuristic scores, lacking quality guarantees. We address this limitation by introducing CP-OPT, an optimization framework to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Furthermore, inspired by the Monty Hall problem, we extend CP's utility beyond uncertainty quantification to improve accuracy. We propose \emph{conformal revision of questions} (CROQ) to revise the problem by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set. The coverage guarantee of CP ensures that the correct choice is in the revised question prompt with high probability, while the smaller number of choices increases the LLM's chances of answering it correctly. Experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with Gemma-2, Llama-3 and Phi-3 models show that CP-OPT significantly reduces set sizes while maintaining coverage, and CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference, especially when paired with CP-OPT scores. Together, CP-OPT and CROQ offer a robust framework for improving both the safety and accuracy of LLM-driven decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Alchihabi, Yuhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in tackling a wide array of graph-related tasks across diverse domains. However, a significant challenge lies in their propensity to generate biased predictions, particularly with respect to sensitive node attributes such as age and gender. These biases, inherent in many machine learning models, are amplified in GNNs due to the message-passing mechanism, which allows nodes to influence each other, rendering the task of making fair predictions notably challenging. This issue is particularly pertinent in critical domains where model fairness holds paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a novel generative Fairness-Aware Subgraph Diffusion (FASD) method for unbiased GNN learning. The method initiates by strategically sampling small subgraphs from the original large input graph, and then proceeds to conduct subgraph debiasing via generative fairness-aware graph diffusion processes based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To effectively diffuse unfairness in the input data, we introduce additional adversary bias perturbations to the subgraphs during the forward diffusion process, and train score-based models to predict these applied perturbations, enabling them to learn the underlying dynamics of the biases present in the data. Subsequently, the trained score-based models are utilized to further debias the original subgraph samples through the reverse diffusion process. Finally, FASD induces fair node predictions on the input graph by performing standard GNN learning on the debiased subgraphs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art Fair GNN baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Javaheri, Jiaxi Ying, Daniel P. Palomar, Farokh Marvasti</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph models provide efficient tools to capture the underlying structure of data defined over networks. Many real-world network topologies are subject to change over time. Learning to model the dynamic interactions between entities in such networks is known as time-varying graph learning. Current methodology for learning such models often lacks robustness to outliers in the data and fails to handle heavy-tailed distributions, a common feature in many real-world datasets (e.g., financial data). This paper addresses the problem of learning time-varying graph models capable of efficiently representing heavy-tailed data. Unlike traditional approaches, we incorporate graph structures with specific spectral properties to enhance data clustering in our model. Our proposed method, which can also deal with noise and missing values in the data, is based on a stochastic approach, where a non-negative vector auto-regressive (VAR) model captures the variations in the graph and a Student-t distribution models the signal originating from this underlying time-varying graph. We propose an iterative method to learn time-varying graph topologies within a semi-online framework where only a mini-batch of data is used to update the graph. Simulations with both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our model in analyzing heavy-tailed data, particularly those found in financial markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoffery Agorkua, Sarah Hernandez, Maria Falquez, Subhadipto Poddar, Shihao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a machine learning approach to predict the number of barges transported by vessels on inland waterways using tracking data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). While AIS tracks the location of tug and tow vessels, it does not monitor the presence or number of barges transported by those vessels. Understanding the number and types of barges conveyed along river segments, between ports, and at ports is crucial for estimating the quantities of freight transported on the nation's waterways. This insight is also valuable for waterway management and infrastructure operations impacting areas such as targeted dredging operations, and data-driven resource allocation. Labeled sample data was generated using observations from traffic cameras located along key river segments and matched to AIS data records. A sample of 164 vessels representing up to 42 barge convoys per vessel was used for model development. The methodology involved first predicting barge presence and then predicting barge quantity. Features derived from the AIS data included speed measures, vessel characteristics, turning measures, and interaction terms. For predicting barge presence, the AdaBoost model achieved an F1 score of 0.932. For predicting barge quantity, the Random Forest combined with an AdaBoost ensemble model achieved an F1 score of 0.886. Bayesian optimization was used for hyperparameter tuning. By advancing predictive modeling for inland waterways, this study offers valuable insights for transportation planners and organizations, which require detailed knowledge of traffic volumes, including the flow of commodities, their destinations, and the tonnage moving in and out of ports.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we present a model for analyzing the cooccurrence count data derived from practical fields such as user-item or item-item data from online shopping platform, cooccurring word-word pairs in sequences of texts. Such data contain important information for developing recommender systems or studying relevance of items or words from non-numerical sources. Different from traditional regression models, there are no observations for covariates. Additionally, the cooccurrence matrix is typically of so high dimension that it does not fit into a computer's memory for modeling. We extract numerical data by defining windows of cooccurrence using weighted count on the continuous scale. Positive probability mass is allowed for zero observations. We present Shared parameter Alternating Tweedie (SA-Tweedie) model and an algorithm to estimate the parameters. We introduce a learning rate adjustment used along with the Fisher scoring method in the inner loop to help the algorithm stay on track of optimizing direction. Gradient descent with Adam update was also considered as an alternative method for the estimation. Simulation studies and an application showed that our algorithm with Fisher scoring and learning rate adjustment outperforms the other two methods. Pseudo-likelihood approach with alternating parameter update was also studied. Numerical studies showed that the pseudo-likelihood approach is not suitable in our shared parameter alternating regression models with unobserved covariates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taejoon Kim, Haiyan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional sparse matrix data frequently arise in various applications. A notable example is the weighted word-word co-occurrence count data, which summarizes the weighted frequency of word pairs appearing within the same context window. This type of data typically contains highly skewed non-negative values with an abundance of zeros. Another example is the co-occurrence of item-item or user-item pairs in e-commerce, which also generates high-dimensional data. The objective is to utilize this data to predict the relevance between items or users. In this paper, we assume that items or users can be represented by unknown dense vectors. The model treats the co-occurrence counts as arising from zero-inflated Gamma random variables and employs cosine similarity between the unknown vectors to summarize item-item relevance. The unknown values are estimated using the shared parameter alternating zero-inflated Gamma regression models (SA-ZIG). Both canonical link and log link models are considered. Two parameter updating schemes are proposed, along with an algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters. Convergence analysis is presented analytically. Numerical studies demonstrate that the SA-ZIG using Fisher scoring without learning rate adjustment may fail to fi nd the maximum likelihood estimate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keith G. Mills, Muhammad Fetrat Qharabagh, Weichen Qiu, Fred X. Han, Mohammad Salameh, Wei Lu, Shangling Jui, Di Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Layer fusion techniques are critical to improving the inference efficiency of deep neural networks (DNN) for deployment. Fusion aims to lower inference costs by reducing data transactions between an accelerator's on-chip buffer and DRAM. This is accomplished by grouped execution of multiple operations like convolution and activations together into single execution units - fusion groups. However, on-chip buffer capacity limits fusion group size and optimizing fusion on whole DNNs requires partitioning into multiple fusion groups. Finding the optimal groups is a complex problem where the presence of invalid solutions hampers traditional search algorithms and demands robust approaches. In this paper we incorporate Explainable AI, specifically Graph Explanation Techniques (GET), into layer fusion. Given an invalid fusion group, we identify the operations most responsible for group invalidity, then use this knowledge to recursively split the original fusion group via a greedy tree-based algorithm to minimize DRAM access. We pair our scheme with common algorithms and optimize DNNs on two types of layer fusion: Line-Buffer Depth First (LBDF) and Branch Requirement Reduction (BRR). Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme on several popular and classical convolutional neural networks like ResNets and MobileNets. Our scheme achieves over 20% DRAM Access reduction on EfficientNet-B3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihao Wang, Ruisi Cai, Yuehao Wang, Jiajun Zhu, Pragya Srivastava, Zhangyang Wang, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as alternatives to transformers. While SSMs are often regarded as effective in capturing long-sequence dependencies, we rigorously demonstrate that they are inherently limited by strong recency bias. Our empirical studies also reveal that this bias impairs the models' ability to recall distant information and introduces robustness issues. Our scaling experiments then discovered that deeper structures in SSMs can facilitate the learning of long contexts. However, subsequent theoretical analysis reveals that as SSMs increase in depth, they exhibit another inevitable tendency toward over-smoothing, e.g., token representations becoming increasingly indistinguishable. This fundamental dilemma between recency and over-smoothing hinders the scalability of existing SSMs. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose to polarize two channels of the state transition matrices in SSMs, setting them to zero and one, respectively, simultaneously addressing recency bias and over-smoothing. Experiments demonstrate that our polarization technique consistently enhances the associative recall accuracy of long-range tokens and unlocks SSMs to benefit further from deeper architectures.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00659">Why Are Positional Encodings Nonessential for Deep Autoregressive Transformers? Revisiting a Petroglyph</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Irie</p>
<p>Abstract: Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is "no" as long as they have more than one layer -- they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without requiring explicit PEs. This property has been known since early efforts (those contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated and was even rediscovered recently. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior publications, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review this long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their input tokens). We also review the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Behrouz, Peilin Zhong, Vahab Mirrokni</p>
<p>Abstract: Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.</p>

In addition to the work done on pre-trained models, we proposed a new model based on CNN, which provides an efficient method for identifying and detecting plant leaf disease. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of our model and compared the results to those of some pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Kumar Panda, Bart Kosko</p>
<p>Abstract: An adaptive multiexpert mixture of feedback causal models can approximate missing or phantom nodes in large-scale causal models. The result gives a scalable form of \emph{big knowledge}. The mixed model approximates a sampled dynamical system by approximating its main limit-cycle equilibria. Each expert first draws a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) with at least one missing causal node or variable. FCMs are directed signed partial-causality cyclic graphs. They mix naturally through convex combination to produce a new causal feedback FCM. Supervised learning helps each expert FCM estimate its phantom node by comparing the FCM's partial equilibrium with the complete multi-node equilibrium. Such phantom-node estimation allows partial control over these causal hallucinations and helps approximate the future trajectory of the dynamical system. But the approximation can be computationally heavy. Mixing the tuned expert FCMs gives a practical way to find several phantom nodes and thereby better approximate the feedback system's true equilibrium behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> HanQin Cai, Chandra Kundu, Jialin Liu, Wotao Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust matrix completion (RMC) is a widely used machine learning tool that simultaneously tackles two critical issues in low-rank data analysis: missing data entries and extreme outliers. This paper proposes a novel scalable and learnable non-convex approach, coined Learned Robust Matrix Completion (LRMC), for large-scale RMC problems. LRMC enjoys low computational complexity with linear convergence. Motivated by the proposed theorem, the free parameters of LRMC can be effectively learned via deep unfolding to achieve optimum performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a flexible feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network framework that extends deep unfolding from fix-number iterations to infinite iterations. The superior empirical performance of LRMC is verified with extensive experiments against state-of-the-art on synthetic datasets and real applications, including video background subtraction, ultrasound imaging, face modeling, and cloud removal from satellite imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Dietz, Dietrich Klakow</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving arithmetic tasks is a simple and fundamental skill, yet modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have great difficulty with them. We introduce the Integrated Gated Calculator (IGC), a module that enables LLMs to perform arithmetic by emulating a calculator on the GPU. We finetune a Llama model with our module and test it on the BigBench Arithmetic benchmark, where it beats the State of the Art, outperforming all models on the benchmark, including models almost two orders of magnitude larger. Our approach takes only a single iteration to run and requires no external tools. It performs arithmetic operations entirely inside the LLM without the need to produce intermediate tokens. It is computationally efficient, interpretable, and avoids side-effects on tasks that do not require arithmetic operations. It reliably achieves 98\% to 99\% accuracy across multiple training runs and for all subtasks, including the substantially harder subtask of multiplication, which was previously unsolved.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00692">Adjoint sharding for very long context training of state space models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzi Xu, Amir Tavanaei, Kavosh Asadi, Karim Bouyarmane</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite very fast progress, efficiently training large language models (LLMs) in very long contexts remains challenging. Existing methods fall back to training LLMs with short contexts (a maximum of a few thousands tokens in training) and use inference time techniques when evaluating on long contexts (above 1M tokens context window at inference). As opposed to long-context-inference, training on very long context input prompts is quickly limited by GPU memory availability and by the prohibitively long training times it requires on state-of-the-art hardware. Meanwhile, many real-life applications require not only inference but also training/fine-tuning with long context on specific tasks. Such applications include, for example, augmenting the context with various sources of raw reference information for fact extraction, fact summarization, or fact reconciliation tasks. We propose adjoint sharding, a novel technique that comprises sharding gradient calculation during training to reduce memory requirements by orders of magnitude, making training on very long context computationally tractable. Adjoint sharding is based on the adjoint method and computes equivalent gradients to backpropagation. We also propose truncated adjoint sharding to speed up the algorithm while maintaining performance. We provide a distributed version, and a paralleled version of adjoint sharding to further speed up training. Empirical results show the proposed adjoint sharding algorithm reduces memory usage by up to 3X with a 1.27B parameter large language model on 1M context length training. This allows to increase the maximum context length during training or fine-tuning of a 1.27B parameter model from 35K tokens to above 100K tokens on a training infrastructure composed of five AWS P4 instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chethan Bhateja, Joseph O'Brien, Afnaan Hashmi, Eva Prakash</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning, metric elicitation refers to the selection of performance metrics that best reflect an individual's implicit preferences for a given application. Currently, metric elicitation methods only consider metrics that depend on the accuracy values encoded within a given model's confusion matrix. However, focusing solely on confusion matrices does not account for other model feasibility considerations such as varied monetary costs or latencies. In our work, we build upon the multiclass metric elicitation framework of Hiranandani et al., extrapolating their proposed Diagonal Linear Performance Metric Elicitation (DLPME) algorithm to account for additional bounded costs and rewards. Our experimental results with synthetic data demonstrate our approach's ability to quickly converge to the true metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanchao Xu, Kaidi Shao, Nikos Logothetis, Zhongwei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing long-term behaviors in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems remains a significant challenge. The Koopman operator framework has emerged as a powerful tool to address this issue by providing a globally linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics. However, existing methods for approximating the Koopman operator and its spectral components, particularly in large-scale systems, often lack robust theoretical guarantees. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) introduces a spectral residual measure to assess the convergence of the estimated Koopman spectrum, which helps filter out spurious spectral components. Nevertheless, it depends on pre-computed spectra, thereby inheriting their inaccuracies. To overcome its limitations, we introduce the Neural Network-ResDMD (NN-ResDMD), a method that directly estimates Koopman spectral components by minimizing the spectral residual. By leveraging neural networks, NN-ResDMD automatically identifies the optimal basis functions of the Koopman invariant subspace, eliminating the need for manual selection and improving the reliability of the analysis. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate that NN-ResDMD significantly improves both accuracy and scalability, making it an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00704">Kolmogorov GAM Networks are all you need!</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Polson, Vadim Sokolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov GAM (K-GAM) networks are shown to be an efficient architecture for training and inference. They are an additive model with an embedding that is independent of the function of interest. They provide an alternative to the transformer architecture. They are the machine learning version of Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem (KST) which provides an efficient representations of a multivariate function. Such representations have use in machine learning for encoding dictionaries (a.k.a. "look-up" tables). KST theory also provides a representation based on translates of the K\"oppen function. The goal of our paper is to interpret this representation in a machine learning context for applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our architecture is equivalent to a topological embedding which is independent of the function together with an additive layer that uses a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). This provides a class of learning procedures with far fewer parameters than current deep learning algorithms. Implementation can be parallelizable which makes our algorithms computationally attractive. To illustrate our methodology, we use the Iris data from statistical learning. We also show that our additive model with non-linear embedding provides an alternative to transformer architectures which from a statistical viewpoint are kernel smoothers. Additive KAN models therefore provide a natural alternative to transformers. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Representation Learning aims to create embeddings for nodes and edges, capturing their features and interconnections. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have excelled in this task, leveraging neural networks to model complex graph relationships. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) emerged as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), showing improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. While KANs have been integrated into unsigned GNNs, their application in signed GNNs remains unexplored. This paper integrates KAN into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs) to evaluate its performance on signed graphs where edges have positive or negative signs. We empirically assess KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN) on downstream tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to enhance the embedding quality in signed networks. Considering the variability in the results indicated by the relatively large standard deviation, KASGCN demonstrates competitive performance with, or similar to, the vanilla SGCN in the evaluated downstream tasks, and its effectiveness is context-dependent (signed graph and parameters...etc.).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tetsuya Hoya, Shunpei Morita</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to pattern classification using a probabilistic neural network model. The strategy is based on a compact-sized probabilistic neural network capable of continuous incremental learning and unlearning tasks. The network is constructed/reconstructed using a simple, one-pass network-growing algorithm with no hyperparameter tuning. Then, given the training dataset, its structure and parameters are automatically determined and can be dynamically varied in continual incremental and decremental learning situations. The algorithm proposed in this work involves no iterative or arduous matrix-based parameter approximations but a simple data-driven updating scheme. Simulation results using nine publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing that compact-sized probabilistic neural networks constructed have a much smaller number of hidden units compared to the original probabilistic neural network model and yet can achieve a similar classification performance to that of multilayer perceptron neural networks in standard classification tasks, while also exhibiting sufficient capability in continuous class incremental learning and unlearning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Missing attribute issues are prevalent in the graph learning, leading to biased outcomes in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing methods that rely on feature propagation are prone to cold start problem, particularly when dealing with attribute resetting and low-degree nodes, which hinder effective propagation and convergence. To address these challenges, we propose AttriReBoost (ARB), a novel method that incorporates propagation-based method to mitigate cold start problems in attribute-missing graphs. ARB enhances global feature propagation by redefining initial boundary conditions and strategically integrating virtual edges, thereby improving node connectivity and ensuring more stable and efficient convergence. This method facilitates gradient-free attribute reconstruction with lower computational overhead. The proposed method is theoretically grounded, with its convergence rigorously established. Extensive experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ARB, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 5.11% over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARB exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, processing a large-scale graph with 2.49 million nodes in just 16 seconds on a single GPU.

<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Yuming Xu, Chen Jason Zhang, Alexander Zhou, Lei Chen, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are essential data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which predict properties or classes for the entire graph, are critical for applications, such as molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in these tasks, but their evaluations are often limited to narrow datasets, tasks, and inconsistent experimental setups, restricting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified evaluation framework for graph-level GNNs. This framework provides a standardized setting to evaluate GNNs across diverse datasets, various graph tasks (e.g., graph classification and regression), and challenging scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Additionally, we propose a novel GNN model with enhanced expressivity and generalization capabilities. Specifically, we enhance the expressivity of GNNs through a $k$-path rooted subgraph approach, enabling the model to effectively count subgraphs (e.g., paths and cycles). Moreover, we introduce a unified graph contrastive learning algorithm for graphs across diverse domains, which adaptively removes unimportant edges to augment graphs, thereby significantly improving generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance against fourteen effective baselines across twenty-seven graph datasets, establishing it as a robust and generalizable model for graph-level tasks.</p>

Such online prediction problems are ubiquitous, ranging from medical trials to web caching to resource allocation. The inherent difficulty of offline recovery also makes the online problem challenging. In this letter, we propose Follow-The-Approximate-Sparse-Leader, an efficient online meta-policy to address this online problem. Through a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that under certain assumptions on the measurement sequence, the proposed policy enjoys a data-dependent sublinear upper bound on the static regret, which can range from logarithmic to square-root. Numerical simulations are performed to corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itamar Shoshani, Ohad Shamir</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning parity functions is a canonical problem in learning theory, which although computationally tractable, is not amenable to standard learning algorithms such as gradient-based methods. This hardness is usually explained via statistical query lower bounds [Kearns, 1998]. However, these bounds only imply that for any given algorithm, there is some worst-case parity function that will be hard to learn. Thus, they do not explain why fixed parities - say, the full parity function over all coordinates - are difficult to learn in practice, at least with standard predictors and gradient-based methods [Abbe and Boix-Adsera, 2022]. In this paper, we address this open problem, by showing that for any fixed parity of some minimal size, using it as a target function to train one-hidden-layer ReLU networks with perturbed gradient descent will fail to produce anything meaningful. To establish this, we prove a new result about the decay of the Fourier coefficients of linear threshold (or weighted majority) functions, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, but their monolithic architecture presents challenges in interpretability, adaptability, and scalability. This paper introduces a novel modular Transformer architecture that explicitly decouples knowledge and reasoning through a generalized cross-attention mechanism to a shared knowledge base, specifically designed for effective knowledge retrieval. Critically, we provide a rigorous mathematical derivation demonstrating that the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in a standard Transformer is a specialized case (a closure) of this generalized cross-attention, revealing its role in implicit knowledge retrieval and validating our design. This theoretical framework provides a new lens for understanding FFNs and lays the foundation for future research exploring enhanced interpretability, adaptability, and scalability, enabling richer interplay with external knowledge bases and other systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Van Quang Nguyen, Quoc Chuong Nguyen, Thu Huong Dang, Truong-Son Hy</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hierarchical Directed Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (HDCARP) is an extension of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), where the arcs of a graph are divided into classes based on their priority. The traversal of these classes is determined by either precedence constraints or a hierarchical objective, resulting in two distinct HDCARP variants. To the best of our knowledge, only one matheuristic has been proposed for these variants, but it performs relatively slowly, particularly for large-scale instances (Ha et al., 2024). In this paper, we propose a fast heuristic to efficiently address the computational challenges of HDCARP. Furthermore, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning (RL) into our heuristic to effectively guide the selection of local search operators, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. We name this hybrid algorithm as the Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Algorithm for Directed Arc Routing (HRDA). The hybrid algorithm adapts to changes in the problem dynamically, using real-time feedback to improve routing strategies and solution's quality by integrating heuristic methods. Extensive computational experiments on artificial instances demonstrate that this hybrid approach significantly improves the speed of the heuristic without deteriorating the solution quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Li, Zhiguang Cao, Yining Ma, Yaoxin Wu, Yue-Jiao Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing neural methods for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) mostly aim at finding a single optimal solution. To discover diverse yet high-quality solutions for Multi-Solution TSP (MSTSP), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning based neural solver, which is primarily featured by an encoder-decoder structured policy. Concretely, on the one hand, a Relativization Filter (RF) is designed to enhance the robustness of the encoder to affine transformations of the instances, so as to potentially improve the quality of the found solutions. On the other hand, a Multi-Attentive Adaptive Active Search (MA3S) is tailored to allow the decoders to strike a balance between the optimality and diversity. Experimental evaluations on benchmark instances demonstrate the superiority of our method over recent neural baselines across different metrics, and its competitive performance against state-of-the-art traditional heuristics with significantly reduced computational time, ranging from $1.3\times$ to $15\times$ faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can also be applied to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syamantak Datta Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advancements in foundation models have significantly impacted machine learning, rigorous tests on the performance of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remain largely underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating the zero-shot, long-horizon forecasting abilities of several leading TSFMs over two synthetic datasets constituting noisy periodic time series. We assess model efficacy across different noise levels, underlying frequencies, and sampling rates. As benchmarks for comparison, we choose two statistical techniques: a Fourier transform (FFT)-based approach and a linear autoregressive (AR) model. Our findings demonstrate that while for time series with bounded periods and higher sampling rates, TSFMs can match or outperform the statistical approaches, their forecasting abilities deteriorate with longer periods, higher noise levels, lower sampling rates and more complex shapes of the time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohua Li, Maoli Liu, Xiangxiang Dai, John C. S. Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: The contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is crucial in sequential decision-making. A line of research, known as online clustering of bandits, extends contextual MAB by grouping similar users into clusters, utilizing shared features to improve learning efficiency. However, existing algorithms, which rely on the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy, struggle to gather adequate statistical information to accurately identify unknown user clusters. As a result, their theoretical analyses require several strong assumptions about the "diversity" of contexts generated by the environment, leading to impractical settings, complicated analyses, and poor practical performance. Removing these assumptions has been a long-standing open problem in the clustering of bandits literature. In this paper, we provide two solutions to this open problem. First, following the i.i.d. context generation setting in existing studies, we propose two novel algorithms, UniCLUB and PhaseUniCLUB, which incorporate enhanced exploration mechanisms to accelerate cluster identification. Remarkably, our algorithms require substantially weaker assumptions while achieving regret bounds comparable to prior work. Second, inspired by the smoothed analysis framework, we propose a more practical setting that eliminates the requirement for i.i.d. context generation used in previous studies, thus enhancing the performance of existing algorithms for online clustering of bandits. Our technique can be applied to both graph-based and set-based clustering of bandits frameworks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Han Meng, Zhenyu Bi, Ingolv T. Urnes, Haipeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising ability in generating high-quality time series (TS) data. Despite the initial success, existing works mostly focus on the authenticity of data at the individual level, but pay less attention to preserving the population-level properties on the entire dataset. Such population-level properties include value distributions for each dimension and distributions of certain functional dependencies (e.g., cross-correlation, CC) between different dimensions. For instance, when generating house energy consumption TS data, the value distributions of the outside temperature and the kitchen temperature should be preserved, as well as the distribution of CC between them. Preserving such TS population-level properties is critical in maintaining the statistical insights of the datasets, mitigating model bias, and augmenting downstream tasks like TS prediction. Yet, it is often overlooked by existing models. Hence, data generated by existing models often bear distribution shifts from the original data. We propose Population-aware Diffusion for Time Series (PaD-TS), a new TS generation model that better preserves the population-level properties. The key novelties of PaD-TS include 1) a new training method explicitly incorporating TS population-level property preservation, and 2) a new dual-channel encoder model architecture that better captures the TS data structure. Empirical results in major benchmark datasets show that PaD-TS can improve the average CC distribution shift score between real and synthetic data by 5.9x while maintaining a performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on individual-level authenticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Wu, Sanjiban Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is challenging in domains where preference data is unavailable. We address the problem of learning reward models for such target domains by leveraging feedback collected from simpler source domains, where human preferences are easier to obtain. Our key insight is that, while domains may differ significantly, human preferences convey \emph{domain-agnostic} concepts that can be effectively captured by a reward model. We propose \method, a framework that trains domain-invariant reward models by optimizing a dual loss: a domain loss that minimizes the divergence between source and target distribution, and a source loss that optimizes preferences on the source domain. We show \method is a general approach that we evaluate and analyze across 4 distinct settings: (1) Cross-lingual transfer (accuracy: $0.621 \rightarrow 0.661$), (2) Clean-to-noisy (accuracy: $0.671 \rightarrow 0.703$), (3) Few-shot-to-full transfer (accuracy: $0.845 \rightarrow 0.920$), and (4) Simple-to-complex tasks transfer (correlation: $0.508 \rightarrow 0.556$).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongming Zhang, Fengshuo Bai, Chenjun Xiao, Chao Gao, Bo Xu, Martin M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: While many sophisticated exploration methods have been proposed, their lack of generality and high computational cost often lead researchers to favor simpler methods like $\epsilon$-greedy. Motivated by this, we introduce $\beta$-DQN, a simple and efficient exploration method that augments the standard DQN with a behavior function $\beta$. This function estimates the probability that each action has been taken at each state. By leveraging $\beta$, we generate a population of diverse policies that balance exploration between state-action coverage and overestimation bias correction. An adaptive meta-controller is designed to select an effective policy for each episode, enabling flexible and explainable exploration. $\beta$-DQN is straightforward to implement and adds minimal computational overhead to the standard DQN. Experiments on both simple and challenging exploration domains show that $\beta$-DQN outperforms existing baseline methods across a wide range of tasks, providing an effective solution for improving exploration in deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nahid Torbati, Michael Gaebler, Simon M. Hofmann, Nico Scherf</p>
<p>Abstract: Representational analysis explores how input data of a neural system are encoded in high dimensional spaces of its distributed neural activations, and how we can compare different systems, for instance, artificial neural networks and brains, on those grounds. While existing methods offer important insights, they typically do not account for local intrinsic geometrical properties within the high-dimensional representation spaces. To go beyond these limitations, we explore Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Ricci flow as tools to study the alignment of representations between humans and artificial neural systems on a geometric level. As a proof-of-principle study, we compared the representations of face stimuli between VGG-Face, a human-aligned version of VGG-Face, and corresponding human similarity judgments from a large online study. Using this discrete geometric framework, we were able to identify local structural similarities and differences by examining the distributions of node and edge curvature and higher-level properties by detecting and comparing community structure in the representational graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Wu, Bo Ji, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with fairness constraints is a framework where multiple arms form a super arm and can be pulled in each round under uncertainty to maximize cumulative rewards while ensuring the minimum average reward required by each arm. The existing pessimistic-optimistic algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness violations) and Upper Confidence Bound estimates as a weight for each arm and selects a super arm with the maximum total weight. The number of super arms could be exponential to the number of arms in many scenarios. In wireless networks, interference constraints can cause the number of super arms to grow exponentially with the number of arms. Evaluating all the feasible super arms to find the one with the maximum total weight can incur extremely high computational complexity in the pessimistic-optimistic algorithm. To avoid this, we develop a low-complexity fair learning algorithm based on the so-called pick-and-compare approach that involves randomly picking $M$ feasible super arms to evaluate. By setting $M$ to a constant, the number of comparison steps in the pessimistic-optimistic algorithm can be reduced to a constant, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity. Our theoretical proof shows this low-complexity design incurs only a slight sacrifice in fairness and regret performance. Finally, we validate the theoretical result by extensive simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhuan Yang, Yuzhou Zhang, Yi Sheng, Youzuo Lin, Lei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the advent of generative AI technologies has made transformational impacts on our daily lives, yet its application in scientific applications remains in its early stages. Data scarcity is a major, well-known barrier in data-driven scientific computing, so physics-guided generative AI holds significant promise. In scientific computing, most tasks study the conversion of multiple data modalities to describe physical phenomena, for example, spatial and waveform in seismic imaging, time and frequency in signal processing, and temporal and spectral in climate modeling; as such, multi-modal pairwise data generation is highly required instead of single-modal data generation, which is usually used in natural images (e.g., faces, scenery). Moreover, in real-world applications, the unbalance of available data in terms of modalities commonly exists; for example, the spatial data (i.e., velocity maps) in seismic imaging can be easily simulated, but real-world seismic waveform is largely lacking. While the most recent efforts enable the powerful diffusion model to generate multi-modal data, how to leverage the unbalanced available data is still unclear. In this work, we use seismic imaging in subsurface geophysics as a vehicle to present ``UB-Diff'', a novel diffusion model for multi-modal paired scientific data generation. One major innovation is a one-in-two-out encoder-decoder network structure, which can ensure pairwise data is obtained from a co-latent representation. Then, the co-latent representation will be used by the diffusion process for pairwise data generation. Experimental results on the OpenFWI dataset show that UB-Diff significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID) score and pairwise evaluation, indicating the generation of reliable and useful multi-modal pairwise data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shortcut learning, i.e., a model's reliance on undesired features not directly relevant to the task, is a major challenge that severely limits the applications of machine learning algorithms, particularly when deploying them to assist in making sensitive decisions, such as in medical diagnostics. In this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning to create an unsupervised framework that is capable of both detecting and mitigating shortcut learning in transformers. We validate our method on multiple datasets. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both worst-group accuracy (samples misclassified due to shortcuts) and average accuracy, while minimizing human annotation effort. Moreover, we demonstrate that the detected shortcuts are meaningful and informative to human experts, and that our framework is computationally efficient, allowing it to be run on consumer hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu You, Haocheng Dai, Yifei Min, Jasjeet S. Sekhon, Sarang Joshi, James S. Duncan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in training data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them, like image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on \textit{atypical} examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we articulate the hypothesis: the imbalanced group performance is a byproduct of ``noisy'' spurious memorization confined to a small set of neurons. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Aranguri, Giulio Biroli, Marc Mezard, Eric Vanden-Eijnden</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have shown that diffusion models can undergo phase transitions, the resolution of which is needed for accurately generating samples. This has motivated the use of different noise schedules, the two most common choices being referred to as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE). Here we revisit these schedules within the framework of stochastic interpolants. Using the Gaussian Mixture (GM) and Curie-Weiss (CW) data distributions as test case models, we first investigate the effect of the variance of the initial noise distribution and show that VP recovers the low-level feature (the distribution of each mode) but misses the high-level feature (the asymmetry between modes), whereas VE performs oppositely. We also show that this dichotomy, which happens when denoising by a constant amount in each step, can be avoided by using noise schedules specific to VP and VE that allow for the recovery of both high- and low-level features. Finally we show that these schedules yield generative models for the GM and CW model whose probability flow ODE can be discretized using $\Theta_d(1)$ steps in dimension $d$ instead of the $\Theta_d(\sqrt{d})$ steps required by constant denoising.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Adamczyk, Volodymyr Makarenko, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V. Kulkarni</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward domains, many environment steps are required to observe reward information. In order to increase the frequency of such observations, "potential-based reward shaping" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required "potential function" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a "bootstrapped" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is a vital component in various everyday applications. Cross-corpus SER models are increasingly recognized for their ability to generalize performance. However, concerns arise regarding fairness across demographics in diverse corpora. Existing fairness research often focuses solely on corpus-specific fairness, neglecting its generalizability in cross-corpus scenarios. Our study focuses on this underexplored area, examining the gender fairness generalizability in cross-corpus SER scenarios. We emphasize that the performance of cross-corpus SER models and their fairness are two distinct considerations. Moreover, we propose the approach of a combined fairness adaptation mechanism to enhance gender fairness in the SER transfer learning tasks by addressing both source and target genders. Our findings bring one of the first insights into the generalizability of gender fairness in cross-corpus SER systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Flight test analysis often requires predefined test points with arbitrarily tight tolerances, leading to extensive and resource-intensive experimental campaigns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to flight test analysis using Gaussian processes (GPs) with physics-informed mean functions to estimate aerodynamic quantities from arbitrary flight test data, validated using real T-38 aircraft data collected in collaboration with the United States Air Force Test Pilot School. We demonstrate our method by estimating the pitching moment coefficient without requiring predefined or repeated flight test points, significantly reducing the need for extensive experimental campaigns. Our approach incorporates aerodynamic models as priors within the GP framework, enhancing predictive accuracy across diverse flight conditions and providing robust uncertainty quantification. Key contributions include the integration of physics-based priors in a probabilistic model, which allows for precise computation from arbitrary flight test maneuvers, and the demonstration of our method capturing relevant dynamic characteristics such as short-period mode behavior. The proposed framework offers a scalable and generalizable solution for efficient data-driven flight test analysis and is able to accurately predict the short period frequency and damping for the T-38 across several Mach and dynamic pressure profiles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data is essential for secondary use, but ensuring its privacy while allowing such use is a critical challenge. Various techniques have been proposed to address privacy concerns in data sharing and publishing. However, these methods often degrade data utility, impacting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. Our research identifies key limitations in existing optimization models for privacy preservation, particularly in handling categorical variables, assessing data utility, and evaluating effectiveness across diverse datasets. We propose a novel multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes information loss and maximizes protection against attacks. This model is empirically validated using diverse datasets and compared with two existing algorithms. We assess information loss, the number of individuals subject to linkage or homogeneity attacks, and ML performance after anonymization. The results indicate that our model achieves lower information loss and more effectively mitigates the risk of attacks, reducing the number of individuals susceptible to these attacks compared to alternative algorithms in some cases. Additionally, our model maintains comparative ML performance relative to the original data or data anonymized by other methods. Our findings highlight significant improvements in privacy protection and ML model performance, offering a comprehensive framework for balancing privacy and utility in data sharing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently. Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness is crucial for protecting infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict, deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the instruments including LASCO C2, EIT and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaopeng Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) has shown remarkable successes in many domains by taking advantage of powerful deep neural networks. Deep neural networks are prone to adversarial attacks and could be easily fooled by adversarial examples. The current progress on this robustness issue is mainly about deep classification models but pays little attention to DML models. Existing works fail to thoroughly inspect the robustness of DML and neglect an important DML scenario, the clustering-based inference. In this work, we first point out the robustness issue of DML models in clustering-based inference scenarios. We find that, for the clustering-based inference, existing defenses designed DML are unable to be reused and the adaptions of defenses designed for deep classification models cannot achieve satisfactory robustness performance. To alleviate the hazard of adversarial examples, we propose a new defense, the Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT), which exploits ensemble learning and adversarial training. EAT promotes the diversity of the ensemble, encouraging each model in the ensemble to have different robustness features, and employs a self-transferring mechanism to make full use of the robustness statistics of the whole ensemble in the update of every single model. We evaluate the EAT method on three widely-used datasets with two popular model architectures. The results show that the proposed EAT method greatly outperforms the adaptions of defenses designed for deep classification models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Safarzadeh, Mohammad Reza Jamali, Behzad Moshiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring reliable ATM services is essential for modern banking, directly impacting customer satisfaction and the operational efficiency of financial institutions. This study introduces a data fusion approach that utilizes multi-classifier fusion techniques, with a special focus on the Stacking Classifier, to enhance the reliability of ATM networks. To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, enabling balanced learning for both frequent and rare events. The proposed framework integrates diverse classification models - Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost - within a Stacking Classifier, achieving a dramatic reduction in false alarms from 3.56 percent to just 0.71 percent, along with an outstanding overall accuracy of 99.29 percent. This multi-classifier fusion method synthesizes the strengths of individual models, leading to significant cost savings and improved operational decision-making. By demonstrating the power of machine learning and data fusion in optimizing ATM status detection, this research provides practical and scalable solutions for financial institutions aiming to enhance their ATM network performance and customer satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohui Chen, Yinkai Wang, Jiaxing He, Yuanqi Du, Soha Hassoun, Xiaolin Xu, Li-Ping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglu Sun, Shuo Shen, Wenzhi Tao, Deyi Xue, Zixia Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a pivotal technique for uncovering the intrinsic information within data and enhancing the interpretability of AI models. However, current state-of-the-art (sota) SR methods struggle to perform correct recovery of symbolic expressions from high-noise data. To address this issue, we introduce a novel noise-resilient SR (NRSR) method capable of recovering expressions from high-noise data. Our method leverages a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach in conjunction with a designed noise-resilient gating module (NGM) to learn symbolic selection policies. The gating module can dynamically filter the meaningless information from high-noise data, thereby demonstrating a high noise-resilient capability for the SR process. And we also design a mixed path entropy (MPE) bonus term in the RL process to increase the exploration capabilities of the policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several popular baselines on benchmarks with high-noise data. Furthermore, our method also can achieve sota performance on benchmarks with clean data, showcasing its robustness and efficacy in SR tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Tahir Hussain Rizvi, Neel Kanwal, Muddasar Naeem, Alfredo Cuzzocrea, Antonio Coronato</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, GLinear, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It also provides better prediction accuracy by using a smaller amount of historical data compared to other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictor (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being parametrically efficient, significantly outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF. We hope that the proposed GLinear opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yu, Shan Jin, Ming Li, Tabinda Sarwar, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis. Cases of long-range dependencies are also presented to further illustrate the effectiveness of ALTER. The implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/yushuowiki/ALTER}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Humaira Kousar, Hasnain Irshad Bhatti, Jaekyun Moon</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient data selection is essential for improving the training efficiency of deep neural networks and reducing the associated annotation costs. However, traditional methods tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. We introduce PruneFuse, a novel method that combines pruning and network fusion to enhance data selection and accelerate network training. In PruneFuse, the original dense network is pruned to generate a smaller surrogate model that efficiently selects the most informative samples from the dataset. Once this iterative data selection selects sufficient samples, the insights learned from the pruned model are seamlessly integrated with the dense model through network fusion, providing an optimized initialization that accelerates training. Extensive experimentation on various datasets demonstrates that PruneFuse significantly reduces computational costs for data selection, achieves better performance than baselines, and accelerates the overall training process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yu, Yingbo Wang, Ruolin Li, Guchun Liu, Yanming Shen, Shaoxiong Ji, Bowen Li, Fengling Han, Xiuzhen Zhang, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are data structures used to represent irregular networks and are prevalent in numerous real-world applications. Previous methods directly model graph structures and achieve significant success. However, these methods encounter bottlenecks due to the inherent irregularity of graphs. An innovative solution is converting graphs into textual representations, thereby harnessing the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and comprehend graphs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of methodologies for applying LLMs to graphs, termed LLM4graph. The core of LLM4graph lies in transforming graphs into texts for LLMs to understand and analyze. Thus, we propose a novel taxonomy of LLM4graph methods in the view of the transformation. Specifically, existing methods can be divided into two paradigms: Graph2text and Graph2token, which transform graphs into texts or tokens as the input of LLMs, respectively. We point out four challenges during the transformation to systematically present existing methods in a problem-oriented perspective. For practical concerns, we provide a guideline for researchers on selecting appropriate models and LLMs for different graphs and hardware constraints. We also identify five future research directions for LLM4graph.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Cui, Yi-Ge Zhang, Hengyu Liu, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy labels is a critical challenge in machine learning, with vast implications for numerous real-world scenarios. While supervised contrastive learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool for navigating label noise, many existing solutions remain heuristic, often devoid of a systematic theoretical foundation for crafting robust supervised contrastive losses. To address the gap, in this paper, we propose a unified theoretical framework for robust losses under the pairwise contrastive paradigm. In particular, we for the first time derive a general robust condition for arbitrary contrastive losses, which serves as a criterion to verify the theoretical robustness of a supervised contrastive loss against label noise. The theory indicates that the popular InfoNCE loss is in fact non-robust, and accordingly inspires us to develop a robust version of InfoNCE, termed Symmetric InfoNCE (SymNCE). Moreover, we highlight that our theory is an inclusive framework that provides explanations to prior robust techniques such as nearest-neighbor (NN) sample selection and robust contrastive loss. Validation experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SymNCE against label noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Mena, Diego Arenas, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) leverages multiple sources or views of data to enhance machine learning model performance and robustness. This approach has been successfully used in the Earth Observation (EO) domain, where views have a heterogeneous nature and can be affected by missing data. Despite the negative effect that missing data has on model predictions, the ML literature has used it as an augmentation technique to improve model generalization, like masking the input data. Inspired by this, we introduce novel methods for EO applications tailored to MVL with missing views. Our methods integrate the combination of a set to simulate all combinations of missing views as different training samples. Instead of replacing missing data with a numerical value, we use dynamic merge functions, like average, and more complex ones like Transformer. This allows the MVL model to entirely ignore the missing views, enhancing its predictive robustness. We experiment on four EO datasets with temporal and static views, including state-of-the-art methods from the EO domain. The results indicate that our methods improve model robustness under conditions of moderate missingness, and improve the predictive performance when all views are present. The proposed methods offer a single adaptive solution to operate effectively with any combination of available views.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuheng Chen, Junyi Fan, Armin Abdollahi, Negin Ashrafi, Kamiar Alaei, Greg Placencia, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-risking condition characterized by bleeding within the brain parenchyma. ICU readmission in ICH patients is a critical outcome, reflecting both clinical severity and resource utilization. Accurate prediction of ICU readmission risk is crucial for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing healthcare resources. This study utilized the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) databases, which contain comprehensive clinical and demographic data on ICU patients. Patients with ICH were identified from both databases. Various clinical, laboratory, and demographic features were extracted for analysis based on both overview literature and experts' opinions. Preprocessing methods like imputing and sampling were applied to improve the performance of our models. Machine learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost, and Random Forest, were employed to develop predictive models for ICU readmission risk. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The developed models demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for ICU readmission in ICH patients, with key predictors including demographic information, clinical parameters, and laboratory measurements. Our study provides a predictive framework for ICU readmission risk in ICH patients, which can aid in clinical decision-making and improve resource allocation in intensive care settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder symptoms of which includes repetitive behaviour and lack of social and communication skills. Even though these symptoms can be seen very clearly in social but a large number of individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. In this paper, we worked on a methodology for the detection of ASD from a 3-dimensional walking video dataset, utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) classification algorithms and nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction from the dataset. The proposed methodology involves the classification of ASD using a supervised ML classification algorithm and extracting important and relevant features from the dataset using nature-inspired optimization algorithms. We also included the ranking coefficients to find the initial leading particle. This selection of particle significantly reduces the computation time and hence, improves the total efficiency and accuracy for ASD detection. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, we deployed various combinationsalgorithms of classification algorithm and nature-inspired algorithms resulting in an outstanding classification accuracy of $100\%$ using the random forest classification algorithm and gravitational search algorithm for feature selection. The application of the proposed methodology with different datasets would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methodology. Due to high accuracy and less total computation time, the proposed methodology will offer a significant contribution to the medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future research and advancements in ASD diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Li, Bingyin Zhao, Zilong Zhao, Kevin Yee, Uzair Javaid, Yingjie Lao, Biplab Sikdar</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in tabular data generation. However, they lack domain-specific inductive biases which are critical to preserving the intrinsic characteristics of tabular data. Meanwhile, they suffer from poor scalability and efficiency due to quadratic computational complexity. In this paper, we propose TabTreeFormer, a hybrid transformer architecture that incorporates a tree-based model that retains tabular-specific inductive biases of non-smooth and potentially low-correlated patterns due to its discreteness and non-rotational invariance, and hence enhances the fidelity and utility of synthetic data. In addition, we devise a dual-quantization tokenizer to capture the multimodal continuous distribution and further facilitate the learning of numerical value distribution. Moreover, our proposed tokenizer reduces the vocabulary size and sequence length due to the limited dimension-wise semantic meaning and training set size of tabular data, rendering a significant model size shrink without sacrificing the capability of the transformer model. We evaluate TabTreeFormer on 10 datasets against multiple generative models on various metrics; our experimental results show that TabTreeFormer achieves superior fidelity, utility, privacy, and efficiency. Our best model yields a 40% utility improvement with 1/16 of the baseline model size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety in the aviation industry is critical, even minor anomalies can lead to severe consequences. This study evaluates the performance of four different models for DP (deep learning), including: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (sRNN), on a multi-class classification task involving Commercial, Military, and Private categories using the Socrata aviation dataset of 4,864 records. The models were assessed using a classification report, confusion matrix analysis, accuracy metrics, validation loss and accuracy curves. Among the models, BLSTM achieved the highest overall accuracy of 72%, demonstrating superior performance in stability and balanced classification, while LSTM followed closely with 71%, excelling in recall for the Commercial class. CNN and sRNN exhibited lower accuracies of 67% and 69%, with significant misclassifications in the Private class. While the results highlight the strengths of BLSTM and LSTM in handling sequential dependencies and complex classification tasks, all models faced challenges with class imbalance, particularly in predicting the Military and Private categories. Addressing these limitations through data augmentation, advanced feature engineering, and ensemble learning techniques could enhance classification accuracy and robustness. This study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate architectures for domain specific tasks</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxian Wei, Anke Tang, Li Shen, Feng Xiong, Chun Yuan, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Merging multiple expert models offers a promising approach for performing multi-task learning without accessing their original data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate task conflicts by sparsifying task vectors or promoting orthogonality among them. However, they overlook the fundamental requirement of model merging: ensuring the merged model performs comparably to task-specific models on respective tasks. We find these methods inevitably discard task-specific information that, while causing conflicts, is crucial for performance. Based on our findings, we frame model merging as a constrained optimization problem ($\textit{i.e.}$, minimizing the gap between the merged model and individual models, subject to the constraint of retaining shared knowledge) and solve it via adaptive projective gradient descent. Specifically, we align the merged model with individual models by decomposing and reconstituting the loss function, alleviating conflicts through $\textit{data-free}$ optimization of task vectors. To retain shared knowledge, we optimize this objective by projecting gradients within a $\textit{shared subspace}$ spanning all tasks. Moreover, we view merging coefficients as adaptive learning rates and propose a task-aware, training-free strategy. Experiments show that our plug-and-play approach consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse architectures and tasks in both vision and NLP domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thorben Werner, Lars Schmidt-Thieme</p>
<p>Abstract: Active Learning (AL) for regression has been systematically under-researched due to the increased difficulty of measuring uncertainty in regression models. Since normalizing flows offer a full predictive distribution instead of a point forecast, they facilitate direct usage of known heuristics for AL like Entropy or Least-Confident sampling. However, we show that most of these heuristics do not work well for normalizing flows in pool-based AL and we need more sophisticated algorithms to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. In this work we propose BALSA, an adaptation of the BALD algorithm, tailored for regression with normalizing flows. With this work we extend current research on uncertainty quantification with normalizing flows \cite{berry2023normalizing, berry2023escaping} to real world data and pool-based AL with multiple acquisition functions and query sizes. We report SOTA results for BALSA across 4 different datasets and 2 different architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the increasing deployment of LEO satellite systems has enabled various space analytics (e.g., crop and climate monitoring), which heavily relies on the advancements in deep learning (DL). However, the intermittent connectivity between LEO satellites and ground station (GS) significantly hinders the timely transmission of raw data to GS for centralized learning, while the scaled-up DL models hamper distributed learning on resource-constrained LEO satellites. Though split learning (SL) can be a potential solution to these problems by partitioning a model and offloading primary training workload to GS, the labor-intensive labeling process remains an obstacle, with intermittent connectivity and data heterogeneity being other challenges. In this paper, we propose LEO-Split, a semi-supervised (SS) SL design tailored for satellite networks to combat these challenges. Leveraging SS learning to handle (labeled) data scarcity, we construct an auxiliary model to tackle the training failure of the satellite-GS non-contact time. Moreover, we propose a pseudo-labeling algorithm to rectify data imbalances across satellites. Lastly, an adaptive activation interpolation scheme is devised to prevent the overfitting of server-side sub-model training at GS. Extensive experiments with real-world LEO satellite traces (e.g., Starlink) demonstrate that our LEO-Split framework achieves superior performance compared to state-ofthe-art benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Ge Zhang, Jingyi Cui, Qiran Li, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has shown significant performance improvements in recent years, often approaching or even rivaling supervised learning in various tasks. However, its learning mechanism is fundamentally different from that of supervised learning. Previous works have shown that difficult-to-learn examples (well-recognized in supervised learning as examples around the decision boundary), which are essential in supervised learning, contribute minimally in unsupervised settings. In this paper, perhaps surprisingly, we find that the direct removal of difficult-to-learn examples, although reduces the sample size, can boost the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. To uncover the reasons behind this, we develop a theoretical framework modeling the similarity between different pairs of samples. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis revealing that the presence of difficult-to-learn examples negatively affects the generalization of contrastive learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the removal of these examples, and techniques such as margin tuning and temperature scaling can enhance its generalization bounds, thereby improving performance. Empirically, we propose a simple and efficient mechanism for selecting difficult-to-learn examples and validate the effectiveness of the aforementioned methods, which substantiates the reliability of our proposed theoretical framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuya Tobari, Shuhei Tomoshige, Hayato Muraki, Kenichi Oishi, Hitoshi Iyatomi</p>
<p>Abstract: When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning.
  In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjing Xu, Caesar Wu, Yuan-Fang Li, Gr\'egoire Danoy, Pascal Bouvry</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models for time series forecasting (TSF) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their effectiveness and versatility. However, these models often require extensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) to achieve the best possible performance, and a unified pipeline for HPO in transformer-based TSF remains lacking. In this paper, we present one such pipeline and conduct extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer-based TSF models. These experiments are conducted on standard benchmark datasets to evaluate and compare the performance of different models, generating practical insights and examples. Our pipeline is generalizable beyond transformer-based architectures and can be applied to other SOTA models, such as Mamba and TimeMixer, as demonstrated in our experiments. The goal of this work is to provide valuable guidance to both industry practitioners and academic researchers in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameters suited to their specific domain applications. The code and complete experimental results are available on GitHub.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01402">Best Transition Matrix Esitimation or Best Label Noise Robustness Classifier? Two Possible Methods to Enhance the Performance of T-revision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixu Liu, Zerui Tao, Naihui Zhang, Sixing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Label noise refers to incorrect labels in a dataset caused by human errors or collection defects, which is common in real-world applications and can significantly reduce the accuracy of models. This report explores how to estimate noise transition matrices and construct deep learning classifiers that are robust against label noise. In cases where the transition matrix is known, we apply forward correction and importance reweighting methods to correct the impact of label noise using the transition matrix. When the transition matrix is unknown or inaccurate, we use the anchor point assumption and T-Revision series methods to estimate or correct the noise matrix. In this study, we further improved the T-Revision method by developing T-Revision-Alpha and T-Revision-Softmax to enhance stability and robustness. Additionally, we designed and implemented two baseline classifiers, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and ResNet-18, based on the cross-entropy loss function. We compared the performance of these methods on predicting clean labels and estimating transition matrices using the FashionMINIST dataset with known noise transition matrices. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, where the noise transition matrix is unknown, we estimated the noise matrix and evaluated the ability of the methods to predict clean labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt Raymond, Paolo Elvati, Jacob C. Saldinger, Jonathan Lin, Xuetao Shi, Angela Violi</p>
<p>Abstract: Nanoparticles (NPs) formed in nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) can have unique properties and applications. However, modeling their growth in these environments presents significant challenges due to the non-equilibrium nature of NTPs, making them computationally expensive to describe. In this work, we address the challenges associated with accelerating the estimation of parameters needed for these models. Specifically, we explore how different machine learning models can be tailored to improve prediction outcomes. We apply these methods to reactive classical molecular dynamics data, which capture the processes associated with colliding silane fragments in NTPs. These reactions exemplify processes where qualitative trends are clear, but their quantification is challenging, hard to generalize, and requires time-consuming simulations. Our results demonstrate that good prediction performance can be achieved when appropriate loss functions are implemented and correct invariances are imposed. While the diversity of molecules used in the training set is critical for accurate prediction, our findings indicate that only a fraction (15-25\%) of the energy and temperature sampling is required to achieve high levels of accuracy. This suggests a substantial reduction in computational effort is possible for similar systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lirong Wu, Haitao Lin, Yufei Huang, Zhangyang Gao, Cheng Tan, Yunfan Liu, Tailin Wu, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that protect the host by binding to specific antigens, and their binding is mainly determined by the Complementary Determining Regions (CDRs) in the antibody. Despite the great progress made in CDR design, existing computational methods still encounter several challenges: 1) poor capability of modeling complex CDRs with long sequences due to insufficient contextual information; 2) conditioned on pre-given antigenic epitopes and their static interaction with the target antibody; 3) neglect of specificity during antibody optimization leads to non-specific antibodies. In this paper, we take into account a variety of node features, edge features, and edge relations to include more contextual and geometric information. We propose a novel Relation-Aware Antibody Design (RAAD) framework, which dynamically models antigen-antibody interactions for co-designing the sequences and structures of antigen-specific CDRs. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation metric to better measure antibody specificity and develop a contrasting specificity-enhancing constraint to optimize the specificity of antibodies. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior capability of RAAD in terms of antibody modeling, generation, and optimization across different CDR types, sequence lengths, pre-training strategies, and input contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Alder, Shivam Nitin Kajale, Milin Tunsiricharoengul, Deblina Sarkar, Ralf Herbrich</p>
<p>Abstract: (Pseudo)random sampling, a costly yet widely used method in (probabilistic) machine learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, remains unfeasible on a truly large scale due to unmet computational requirements. We introduce an energy-efficient algorithm for uniform Float16 sampling, utilizing a room-temperature stochastic magnetic tunnel junction device to generate truly random floating-point numbers. By avoiding expensive symbolic computation and mapping physical phenomena directly to the statistical properties of the floating-point format and uniform distribution, our approach achieves a higher level of energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art Mersenne-Twister algorithm by a minimum factor of 9721 and an improvement factor of 5649 compared to the more energy-efficient PCG algorithm. Building on this sampling technique and hardware framework, we decompose arbitrary distributions into many non-overlapping approximative uniform distributions along with convolution and prior-likelihood operations, which allows us to sample from any 1D distribution without closed-form solutions. We provide measurements of the potential accumulated approximation errors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Yahe Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of machine learning in financial risk management, conventional wisdom suggests that longer training periods and more feature variables contribute to improved model performance. This paper, focusing on mortgage default prediction, empirically discovers a phenomenon that contradicts traditional knowledge: in time series prediction, increased training data timespan and additional non-critical features actually lead to significant deterioration in prediction effectiveness. Using Fannie Mae's mortgage data, the study compares predictive performance across different time window lengths (2012-2022) and feature combinations, revealing that shorter time windows (such as single-year periods) paired with carefully selected key features yield superior prediction results. The experimental results indicate that extended time spans may introduce noise from historical data and outdated market patterns, while excessive non-critical features interfere with the model's learning of core default factors. This research not only challenges the traditional "more is better" approach in data modeling but also provides new insights and practical guidance for feature selection and time window optimization in financial risk prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a large language model (LLM) capable of processing speech inputs and show that tuning it further with reinforcement learning on human preference (RLHF) enables it to adapt better to disordered speech than traditional fine-tuning. Our method replaces low-frequency text tokens in an LLM's vocabulary with audio tokens and enables the model to recognize speech by fine-tuning it on speech with transcripts. We then use RL with rewards based on syntactic and semantic accuracy measures generalizing the LLM further to recognize disordered speech. While the resulting LLM does not outperform existing systems for speech recognition, we find that tuning with reinforcement learning using custom rewards leads to substantially better performance than supervised fine-tuning of the language model, specifically when adapting to speech in a different setting. This presents a compelling alternative tuning strategy for speech recognition using large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of transfer learning in machine translation across diverse linguistic families by evaluating five distinct language pairs. Leveraging pre-trained models on high-resource languages, these models were fine-tuned on low-resource languages, examining variations in hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and weight decay. The research encompasses language pairs from different linguistic backgrounds: Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic - Levantine Arabic), Bantu (Hausa - Zulu), Romance (Spanish - Catalan), Slavic (Slovakian - Macedonian), and language isolates (Eastern Armenian - Western Armenian). Results demonstrate that transfer learning is effective across different language families, although the impact of hyperparameters varies. A moderate batch size (e.g., 32) is generally more effective, while very high learning rates can disrupt model training. The study highlights the universality of transfer learning in multilingual contexts and suggests that consistent hyperparameter settings can simplify and enhance the efficiency of multilingual model training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Network intrusion detection systems face significant challenges in identifying emerging attack patterns, especially when limited data samples are available. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Space Prototypical Learning (MSPL) framework tailored for few-shot attack detection. The framework operates across multiple metric spaces-Euclidean, Cosine, Chebyshev, and Wasserstein distances-integrated through a constrained weighting scheme to enhance embedding robustness and improve pattern recognition. By leveraging Polyak-averaged prototype generation, the framework stabilizes the learning process and effectively adapts to rare and zero-day attacks. Additionally, an episodic training paradigm ensures balanced representation across diverse attack classes, enabling robust generalization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSPL outperforms traditional approaches in detecting low-profile and novel attack types, establishing it as a robust solution for zero-day attack detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring trustworthiness is fundamental to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) that is considered societally responsible, particularly in cancer diagnostics, where a misdiagnosis can have dire consequences. Current digital pathology AI models lack systematic solutions to address trustworthiness concerns arising from model limitations and data discrepancies between model deployment and development environments. To address this issue, we developed TRUECAM, a framework designed to ensure both data and model trustworthiness in non-small cell lung cancer subtyping with whole-slide images. TRUECAM integrates 1) a spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process for identifying out-of-scope inputs and 2) an ambiguity-guided elimination of tiles to filter out highly ambiguous regions, addressing data trustworthiness, as well as 3) conformal prediction to ensure controlled error rates. We systematically evaluated the framework across multiple large-scale cancer datasets, leveraging both task-specific and foundation models, illustrate that an AI model wrapped with TRUECAM significantly outperforms models that lack such guidance, in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency, while also achieving improvements in fairness. These findings highlight TRUECAM as a versatile wrapper framework for digital pathology AI models with diverse architectural designs, promoting their responsible and effective applications in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Respiratory sound classification plays a pivotal role in diagnosing respiratory diseases. While deep learning models have shown success with various respiratory sound datasets, our experiments indicate that models trained on one dataset often fail to generalize effectively to others, mainly due to data collection and annotation \emph{inconsistencies}. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Lungmix}, a novel data augmentation technique inspired by Mixup. Lungmix generates augmented data by blending waveforms using loudness and random masks while interpolating labels based on their semantic meaning, helping the model learn more generalized representations. Comprehensive evaluations across three datasets, namely ICBHI, SPR, and HF, demonstrate that Lungmix significantly enhances model generalization to unseen data. In particular, Lungmix boosts the 4-class classification score by up to 3.55\%, achieving performance comparable to models trained directly on the target dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyu Cheng, Chang Zhou, Yang Zhao, Jin Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth of data-intensive applications has placed unprecedented demands on modern storage systems, necessitating dynamic and efficient optimization strategies. Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1]. The proposed framework operates within the storage kernel, ensuring minimal latency and low computational overhead. Through an adaptive feedback mechanism, RL-Storage dynamically adjusts critical parameters, achieving efficient resource utilization across a wide range of workloads. Experimental evaluations conducted on a range of benchmarks, including RocksDB and PostgreSQL, demonstrate significant improvements, with throughput gains of up to 2.6x and latency reductions of 43% compared to baseline heuristics. Additionally, RL-Storage achieves these performance enhancements with a negligible CPU overhead of 0.11% and a memory footprint of only 5 KB, making it suitable for seamless deployment in production environments. This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Yongyi Yang, Maya Okawa, Kento Nishi, Martin Wattenberg, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunsheng Zuo, Pavel Guerzhoy, Michael Guerzhoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers with causal attention can solve tasks that require positional information without using positional encodings. In this work, we propose and investigate a new hypothesis about how positional information can be stored without using explicit positional encoding. We observe that nearby embeddings are more similar to each other than faraway embeddings, allowing the transformer to potentially reconstruct the positions of tokens. We show that this pattern can occur in both the trained and the randomly initialized Transformer models with causal attention and no positional encodings over a common range of hyperparameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled agents to master complex video games, from first-person shooters like Counter-Strike to real-time strategy games such as StarCraft II and racing games like Gran Turismo. While these achievements are notable, applying these AI methods in commercial video game production remains challenging due to computational constraints. In commercial scenarios, the majority of computational resources are allocated to 3D rendering, leaving limited capacity for AI methods, which often demand high computational power, particularly those relying on pixel-based sensors. Moreover, the gaming industry prioritizes creating human-like behavior in AI agents to enhance player experience, unlike academic models that focus on maximizing game performance. This paper introduces a novel methodology for training neural networks via imitation learning to play a complex, commercial-standard, VALORANT-like 2v2 tactical shooter game, requiring only modest CPU hardware during inference. Our approach leverages an innovative, pixel-free perception architecture using a small set of ray-cast sensors, which capture essential spatial information efficiently. These sensors allow AI to perform competently without the computational overhead of traditional methods. Models are trained to mimic human behavior using supervised learning on human trajectory data, resulting in realistic and engaging AI agents. Human evaluation tests confirm that our AI agents provide human-like gameplay experiences while operating efficiently under computational constraints. This offers a significant advancement in AI model development for tactical shooter games and possibly other genres.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katherine Tsai, Mladen Kolar, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the parameter recovery of Markov-switching ordinary differential processes from discrete observations, where the differential equations are nonlinear additive models. This framework has been widely applied in biological systems, control systems, and other domains; however, limited research has been conducted on reconstructing the generating processes from observations. In contrast, many physical systems, such as human brains, cannot be directly experimented upon and rely on observations to infer the underlying systems. To address this gap, this manuscript presents a comprehensive study of the model, encompassing algorithm design, optimization guarantees, and quantification of statistical errors. Specifically, we develop a two-stage algorithm that first recovers the continuous sample path from discrete samples and then estimates the parameters of the processes. We provide novel theoretical insights into the statistical error and linear convergence guarantee when the processes are $\beta$-mixing. Our analysis is based on the truncation of the latent posterior processes and demonstrates that the truncated processes approximate the true processes under mixing conditions. We apply this model to investigate the differences in resting-state brain networks between the ADHD group and normal controls, revealing differences in the transition rate matrices of the two groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John F. Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Galaxy appearances reveal the physics of how they formed and evolved. Machine learning models can now exploit galaxies' information-rich morphologies to predict physical properties directly from image cutouts. Learning the relationship between pixel-level features and galaxy properties is essential for building a physical understanding of galaxy evolution, but we are still unable to explicate the details of how deep neural networks represent image features. To address this lack of interpretability, we present a novel neural network architecture called a Sparse Feature Network (SFNet). SFNets produce interpretable features that can be linearly combined in order to estimate galaxy properties like optical emission line ratios or gas-phase metallicity. We find that SFNets do not sacrifice accuracy in order to gain interpretability, and that they perform comparably well to cutting-edge models on astronomical machine learning tasks. Our novel approach is valuable for finding physical patterns in large datasets and helping astronomers interpret machine learning results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> G. Bruno De Luca</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing the landscape of vacua of higher-dimensional theories of gravity by directly solving the low-energy (semi-)classical equations of motion is notoriously difficult. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Machine Learning techniques as tools for solving the equations of motion for general warped gravity compactifications. As a proof-of-concept we use Neural Networks to solve the Einstein PDEs on non-trivial three manifolds obtained by filling one or more cusps of hyperbolic manifolds. While in three dimensions an Einstein metric is also locally hyperbolic, the generality and scalability of Machine Learning methods, the availability of explicit families of hyperbolic manifolds in higher dimensions, and the universality of the filling procedure strongly suggest that the methods and code developed in this work can be of broader applicability. Specifically, they can be used to tackle both the geometric problem of numerically constructing novel higher-dimensional negatively curved Einstein metrics, as well as the physical problem of constructing four-dimensional de Sitter compactifications of M-theory on the same manifolds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mourad Heddaya, Kyle MacMillan, Anup Malani, Hongyuan Mei, Chenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces CaseSumm, a novel dataset for long-context summarization in the legal domain that addresses the need for longer and more complex datasets for summarization evaluation. We collect 25.6K U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) opinions and their official summaries, known as "syllabuses." Our dataset is the largest open legal case summarization dataset, and is the first to include summaries of SCOTUS decisions dating back to 1815.
  We also present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated summaries using both automatic metrics and expert human evaluation, revealing discrepancies between these assessment methods. Our evaluation shows Mistral 7b, a smaller open-source model, outperforms larger models on most automatic metrics and successfully generates syllabus-like summaries. In contrast, human expert annotators indicate that Mistral summaries contain hallucinations. The annotators consistently rank GPT-4 summaries as clearer and exhibiting greater sensitivity and specificity. Further, we find that LLM-based evaluations are not more correlated with human evaluations than traditional automatic metrics. Furthermore, our analysis identifies specific hallucinations in generated summaries, including precedent citation errors and misrepresentations of case facts. These findings demonstrate the limitations of current automatic evaluation methods for legal summarization and highlight the critical role of human evaluation in assessing summary quality, particularly in complex, high-stakes domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaozhou You, Jian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating desired images conditioned on given text descriptions has received lots of attention. Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have demonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the favored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face some obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve more powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we propose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be specific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity generator. (i) The vision-empowered discriminator absorbs the complex scene understanding ability and the domain generalization ability from pretrained vision models to enhance model performance. Unlike previous works, we explore stacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple different representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve effective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The high-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks (HFBlock). And the HFBlock contains several deep fusion modules and a global fusion module, which play different roles to benefit our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed TIGER both on standard and zero-shot text-to-image synthesis tasks. On the standard text-to-image synthesis task, TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which obtain a new FID 5.48 (COCO) and 9.38 (CUB). On the zero-shot text-to-image synthesis task, we achieve comparable performance with fewer model parameters, smaller training data size and faster inference speed. Additionally, more experiments and analyses are conducted in the Supplementary Material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shima Nassiri, Mohsen Bayati, Joe Cooprider</p>
<p>Abstract: A/B tests, also known as randomized controlled experiments (RCTs), are the gold standard for evaluating the impact of new policies, products, or decisions. However, these tests can be costly in terms of time and resources, potentially exposing users, customers, or other test subjects (units) to inferior options. This paper explores practical considerations in applying methodologies inspired by "synthetic control" as an alternative to traditional A/B testing in settings with very large numbers of units, involving up to hundreds of millions of units, which is common in modern applications such as e-commerce and ride-sharing platforms. This method is particularly valuable in settings where the treatment affects only a subset of units, leaving many units unaffected. In these scenarios, synthetic control methods leverage data from unaffected units to estimate counterfactual outcomes for treated units. After the treatment is implemented, these estimates can be compared to actual outcomes to measure the treatment effect. A key challenge in creating accurate counterfactual outcomes is interpolation bias, a well-documented phenomenon that occurs when control units differ significantly from treated units. To address this, we propose a two-phase approach: first using nearest neighbor matching based on unit covariates to select similar control units, then applying supervised learning methods suitable for high-dimensional data to estimate counterfactual outcomes. Testing using six large-scale experiments demonstrates that this approach successfully improves estimate accuracy. However, our analysis reveals that machine learning bias -- which arises from methods that trade off bias for variance reduction -- can impact results and affect conclusions about treatment effects. We document this bias in large-scale experimental settings and propose effective de-biasing techniques to address this challenge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusionmodels(DMs)havedemonstratedremarkableachievements in synthesizing images of high fidelity and diversity. However, the extensive computational requirements and slow generative speed of diffusion models have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose a novel post-training quantization for diffusion models (PQD), which is a time-aware optimization framework for diffusion models based on post-training quantization. The proposed framework optimizes the inference process by selecting representative samples and conducting time-aware calibration. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to directly quantize full-precision diffusion models into 8-bit or 4-bit models while maintaining comparable performance in a training-free manner, achieving a few FID change on ImageNet for unconditional image generation. Our approach demonstrates compatibility and can also be applied to 512x512 text-guided image generation for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Pingzhi Li, Min Chen, Jinglei Cheng, Junyu Liu, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taniya Das, Louis Mahon, Thomas Lukasiewicz</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the challenging tasks in the field of video understanding is extracting semantic content from video inputs. Most existing systems use language models to describe videos in natural language sentences, but this has several major shortcomings. Such systems can rely too heavily on the language model component and base their output on statistical regularities in natural language text rather than on the visual contents of the video. Additionally, natural language annotations cannot be readily processed by a computer, are difficult to evaluate with performance metrics and cannot be easily translated into a different natural language. In this paper, we propose a method to annotate videos with knowledge graphs, and so avoid these problems. Specifically, we propose a deep-learning-based model for this task that first predicts pairs of individuals and then the relations between them. Additionally, we propose an extension of our model for the inclusion of background knowledge in the construction of knowledge graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying tropical cyclones that generate destructive storm tides for risk assessment, such as from large downscaled storm catalogs for climate studies, is often intractable because it entails many expensive Monte Carlo hydrodynamic simulations. Here, we show that surrogate models are promising from accuracy, recall, and precision perspectives, and they ``generalize" to novel climate scenarios. We then present an informative online learning approach to rapidly search for extreme storm tide-producing cyclones using only a few hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from a minimal subset of TCs with detailed storm tide hydrodynamic simulations, a surrogate model selects informative data to retrain online and iteratively improves its predictions of damaging TCs. Results on an extensive catalog of downscaled TCs indicate a 100% precision retrieving the rare destructive storms training using less than 20% of the simulations as training. The informative sampling approach is efficient, scalable to large storm catalogs, and generalizable to climate scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lidars and cameras play essential roles in autonomous driving, offering complementary information for 3D detection. The state-of-the-art fusion methods integrate them at the feature level, but they mostly rely on the learned soft association between point clouds and images, which lacks interpretability and neglects the hard association between them. In this paper, we combine feature-level fusion with point-level fusion, using hard association established by the calibration matrices to guide the generation of object queries. Specifically, in the early fusion stage, we use the 2D CNN features of images to decorate the point cloud data, and employ two independent sparse convolutions to extract the decorated point cloud features. In the mid-level fusion stage, we initialize the queries with a center heatmap and embed the predicted class labels as auxiliary information into the queries, making the initial positions closer to the actual centers of the targets. Extensive experiments conducted on two popular datasets, i.e. KITTI, Waymo, demonstrate the superiority of DecoratingFusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, many studies have increasingly explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate research ideas and scientific hypotheses. However, real-world research and development often require solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges where solutions may not be readily found through existing knowledge related to the problem. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the vast, comprehensive knowledge of LLMs to generate effective, breakthrough solutions by integrating various perspectives from other disciplines. Here, we propose SELLM (Solution Enumeration via comprehensive List and LLM), a framework leveraging LLMs and structured guidance using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles, such as International Patent Classification (IPC) and the periodic table of elements. SELLM systematically constructs comprehensive expert agents from the list to generate cross-disciplinary and effective solutions. To evaluate SELLM's practicality, we applied it to two challenges: improving light extraction in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting and developing electrodes for next-generation memory materials. The results demonstrate that SELLM significantly facilitates the generation of effective solutions compared to cases without specific customization or effort, showcasing the potential of SELLM to enable LLMs to generate effective solutions even for challenging problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Yi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of class-incremental learning (CIL), alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem is a pivotal challenge. This paper discovers a counter-intuitive observation: by incorporating domain shift into CIL tasks, the forgetting rate is significantly reduced. Our comprehensive studies demonstrate that incorporating domain shift leads to a clearer separation in the feature distribution across tasks and helps reduce parameter interference during the learning process. Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method named DisCo to deal with CIL tasks. DisCo introduces a lightweight prototype pool that utilizes contrastive learning to promote distinct feature distributions for the current task relative to previous ones, effectively mitigating interference across tasks. DisCo can be easily integrated into existing state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods. Experimental results show that incorporating our method into various CIL methods achieves substantial performance improvements, validating the benefits of our approach in enhancing class-incremental learning by separating feature representation and reducing interference. These findings illustrate that DisCo can serve as a robust fashion for future research in class-incremental learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI algorithms require labeled data. In real world, majority of data are unlabeled. Labeling the data are costly. this is particularly true for some areas requiring special skills, such as reading radiology images by physicians. To most efficiently use expert's time for the data labeling, one promising approach is human-in-the-loop active learning algorithm. In this work, we propose a novel active learning framework with significant potential for application in modern AI systems. Unlike the traditional active learning methods, which only focus on determining which data point should be labeled, our framework also introduces an innovative perspective on incorporating different query scheme. We propose a model to integrate the information from different types of queries. Based on this model, our active learning frame can automatically determine how the next question is queried. We further developed a data driven exploration and exploitation framework into our active learning method. This method can be embedded in numerous active learning algorithms. Through simulations on five real-world datasets, including a highly complex real image task, our proposed active learning framework exhibits higher accuracy and lower loss compared to other methods.</p>

We provide an error analysis for our proposed method along with comprehensive numerical results on several PDE benchmarks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art solvers that face challenges with a large number of collocation points, our proposed method reduces the computational complexity. Moreover, the implementation of our method is simple and does not require additional computational resources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Li, Henry Li, Yichun Shi, Amir Barati Farimani, Yuval Kluger, Linjie Yang, Peng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have gained tremendous success in text-to-image generation, yet still lag behind with visual understanding tasks, an area dominated by autoregressive vision-language models. We propose a large-scale and fully end-to-end diffusion model for multi-modal understanding and generation that significantly improves on existing diffusion-based multimodal models, and is the first of its kind to support the full suite of vision-language modeling capabilities. Inspired by the multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) and recent advances in discrete diffusion language modeling, we leverage a cross-modal maximum likelihood estimation framework that simultaneously trains the conditional likelihoods of both images and text jointly under a single loss function, which is back-propagated through both branches of the diffusion transformer. The resulting model is highly flexible and capable of a wide range of tasks including image generation, captioning, and visual question answering. Our model attained competitive performance compared to recent unified image understanding and generation models, demonstrating the potential of multimodal diffusion modeling as a promising alternative to autoregressive next-token prediction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashay Athalye, Nishanth Kumar, Tom Silver, Yichao Liang, Tom\'as Lozano-P\'erez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling</p>
<p>Abstract: Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in highly-variable, combinatorially-complex robotics domains given raw sensor input in the form of images. Previous work has shown that one way to achieve this aim is to learn a structured abstract transition model in the form of symbolic predicates and operators, and then plan within this model to solve novel tasks at test time. However, these learned models do not ground directly into pixels from just a handful of demonstrations. In this work, we propose to invent predicates that operate directly over input images by leveraging the capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Our key idea is that, given a set of demonstrations, a VLM can be used to propose a set of predicates that are potentially relevant for decision-making and then to determine the truth values of these predicates in both the given demonstrations and new image inputs. We build upon an existing framework for predicate invention, which generates feature-based predicates operating on object-centric states, to also generate visual predicates that operate on images. Experimentally, we show that our approach -- pix2pred -- is able to invent semantically meaningful predicates that enable generalization to novel, complex, and long-horizon tasks across two simulated robotic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Guo, Yaqiong Zhang, Lieyang Chen, Arfat Ahmad Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: The key to ensuring the safe obstacle avoidance function of autonomous driving systems lies in the use of extremely accurate vehicle recognition techniques. However, the variability of the actual road environment and the diverse characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians together constitute a huge obstacle to improving detection accuracy, posing a serious challenge to the realization of this goal. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8 vehicle detection method. Specifically, taking the YOLOv8n-seg model as the base model, firstly, the FasterNet network is used to replace the backbone network to achieve the purpose of reducing the computational complexity and memory while improving the detection accuracy and speed; secondly, the feature enhancement is achieved by adding the attention mechanism CBAM to the Neck; and lastly, the loss function CIoU is modified to WIoU, which optimizes the detection box localization while improving the segmentation accuracy. The results show that the improved model achieves 98.3%, 89.1% and 88.4% detection accuracy for car, Person and Motorcycle. Compared with the pre-improvement and YOLOv9 models in six metrics such as Precision.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00303">SAM-Aware Graph Prompt Reasoning Network for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi-Feng Peng, Guolei Sun, Yong Li, Hongsong Wang, Guo-Sen Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary challenge of cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is the domain disparity between the training and inference phases, which can exist in either the input data or the target classes. Previous models struggle to learn feature representations that generalize to various unknown domains from limited training domain samples. In contrast, the large-scale visual model SAM, pre-trained on tens of millions of images from various domains and classes, possesses excellent generalizability. In this work, we propose a SAM-aware graph prompt reasoning network (GPRN) that fully leverages SAM to guide CD-FSS feature representation learning and improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose a SAM-aware prompt initialization module (SPI) to transform the masks generated by SAM into visual prompts enriched with high-level semantic information. Since SAM tends to divide an object into many sub-regions, this may lead to visual prompts representing the same semantic object having inconsistent or fragmented features. We further propose a graph prompt reasoning (GPR) module that constructs a graph among visual prompts to reason about their interrelationships and enable each visual prompt to aggregate information from similar prompts, thus achieving global semantic consistency. Subsequently, each visual prompt embeds its semantic information into the corresponding mask region to assist in feature representation learning. To refine the segmentation mask during testing, we also design a non-parameter adaptive point selection module (APS) to select representative point prompts from query predictions and feed them back to SAM to refine inaccurate segmentation results. Experiments on four standard CD-FSS datasets demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art results. Code: https://github.com/CVL-hub/GPRN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances downstream task execution by retrieving additional information, such as knowledge, skills, and tools from external sources. Graph, by its intrinsic "nodes connected by edges" nature, encodes massive heterogeneous and relational information, making it a golden resource for RAG in tremendous real-world applications. As a result, we have recently witnessed increasing attention on equipping RAG with Graph, i.e., GraphRAG. However, unlike conventional RAG, where the retriever, generator, and external data sources can be uniformly designed in the neural-embedding space, the uniqueness of graph-structured data, such as diverse-formatted and domain-specific relational knowledge, poses unique and significant challenges when designing GraphRAG for different domains. Given the broad applicability, the associated design challenges, and the recent surge in GraphRAG, a systematic and up-to-date survey of its key concepts and techniques is urgently desired. Following this motivation, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on GraphRAG. Our survey first proposes a holistic GraphRAG framework by defining its key components, including query processor, retriever, organizer, generator, and data source. Furthermore, recognizing that graphs in different domains exhibit distinct relational patterns and require dedicated designs, we review GraphRAG techniques uniquely tailored to each domain. Finally, we discuss research challenges and brainstorm directions to inspire cross-disciplinary opportunities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexin Wang, Yiju Guo, Bing Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion prediction (HMP) involves forecasting future human motion based on historical data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jicheol Park, Boseung Jeong, Dongwon Kim, Suha Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based person search is the task of finding person images that are the most relevant to the natural language text description given as query. The main challenge of this task is a large gap between the target images and text queries, which makes it difficult to establish correspondence and distinguish subtle differences across people. To address this challenge, we introduce an efficient encoder-decoder model that extracts coarse-to-fine embedding vectors which are semantically aligned across the two modalities without supervision for the alignment. There is another challenge of learning to capture fine-grained information with only person IDs as supervision, where similar body parts of different individuals are considered different due to the lack of part-level supervision. To tackle this, we propose a novel ranking loss, dubbed commonality-based margin ranking loss, which quantifies the degree of commonality of each body part and reflects it during the learning of fine-grained body part details. As a consequence, it enables our method to achieve the best records on three public benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary scene understanding using 3D Gaussian (3DGS) representations has garnered considerable attention. However, existing methods mostly lift knowledge from large 2D vision models into 3DGS on a scene-by-scene basis, restricting the capabilities of open-vocabulary querying within their training scenes so that lacking the generalizability to novel scenes. In this work, we propose \textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities. Code and the SegGaussian dataset will be released. (https://github.com/runnanchen/OVGaussian).</p>

<p>Abstract: Layer removal has emerged as a promising approach for compressing large language models (LLMs) by leveraging redundancy within layers to reduce model size and accelerate inference. However, this technique often compromises internal consistency, leading to performance degradation and instability, with varying impacts across different model architectures. In this work, we propose Taco-SVD, a task-aware framework that retains task-critical singular value directions, preserving internal consistency while enabling efficient compression. Unlike direct layer removal, Taco-SVD preserves task-critical transformations to mitigate performance degradation. By leveraging gradient-based attribution methods, Taco-SVD aligns singular values with downstream task objectives. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Taco-SVD outperforms existing methods in perplexity and task performance across different architectures while ensuring minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in single label incremental learning (SLCIL),yet the more practical and challenging multi label class incremental learning (MLCIL) remains understudied. Recently,visual language models such as CLIP have achieved good results in classification tasks. However,directly using CLIP to solve MLCIL issue can lead to catastrophic forgetting. To tackle this issue, we integrate an improved data replay mechanism and prompt loss to curb knowledge forgetting. Specifically,our model enhances the prompt information to better adapt to multi-label classification tasks and employs confidence-based replay strategy to select representative samples. Moreover, the prompt loss significantly reduces the model's forgetting of previous knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has substantially improved the performance of MLCIL tasks across multiple benchmark datasets,validating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Wang, Xiaoyang Wang, Huihui Bai, Eng Gee Lim, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing unsupervised distillation-based methods rely on the differences between encoded and decoded features to locate abnormal regions in test images. However, the decoder trained only on normal samples still reconstructs abnormal patch features well, degrading performance. This issue is particularly pronounced in unsupervised multi-class anomaly detection tasks. We attribute this behavior to over-generalization(OG) of decoder: the significantly increasing diversity of patch patterns in multi-class training enhances the model generalization on normal patches, but also inadvertently broadens its generalization to abnormal patches. To mitigate OG, we propose a novel approach that leverages class-agnostic learnable prompts to capture common textual normality across various visual patterns, and then apply them to guide the decoded features towards a normal textual representation, suppressing over-generalization of the decoder on abnormal patterns. To further improve performance, we also introduce a gated mixture-of-experts module to specialize in handling diverse patch patterns and reduce mutual interference between them in multi-class training. Our method achieves competitive performance on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. However, current RAG methods face two limitations: (1) they only cover limited RAG scenarios. (2) They suffer from limited task diversity due to the lack of a general RAG dataset. To address these limitations, we propose RAG-Instruct, a general method for synthesizing diverse and high-quality RAG instruction data based on any source corpus. Our approach leverages (1) five RAG paradigms, which encompass diverse query-document relationships, and (2) instruction simulation, which enhances instruction diversity and quality by utilizing the strengths of existing instruction datasets. Using this method, we construct a 40K instruction dataset from Wikipedia, comprehensively covering diverse RAG scenarios and tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RAG-Instruct effectively enhances LLMs' RAG capabilities, achieving strong zero-shot performance and significantly outperforming various RAG baselines across a diverse set of tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawen Yu, Shunping Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance segmentation performance in remote sensing images (RSIs) is significantly affected by two issues: how to extract accurate boundaries of objects from remote imaging through the dynamic atmosphere, and how to integrate the mutual information of related object instances scattered over a vast spatial region. In this study, we propose a novel Shape Guided Transformer Network (SGTN) to accurately extract objects at the instance level. Inspired by the global contextual modeling capacity of the self-attention mechanism, we propose an effective transformer encoder termed LSwin, which incorporates vertical and horizontal 1D global self-attention mechanisms to obtain better global-perception capacity for RSIs than the popular local-shifted-window based Swin Transformer. To achieve accurate instance mask segmentation, we introduce a shape guidance module (SGM) to emphasize the object boundary and shape information. The combination of SGM, which emphasizes the local detail information, and LSwin, which focuses on the global context relationships, achieve excellent RSI instance segmentation. Their effectiveness was validated through comprehensive ablation experiments. Especially, LSwin is proved better than the popular ResNet and Swin transformer encoder at the same level of efficiency. Compared to other instance segmentation methods, our SGTN achieves the highest average precision (AP) scores on two single-class public datasets (WHU dataset and BITCC dataset) and a multi-class public dataset (NWPU VHR-10 dataset).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evelyn Zhang, Bang Xiao, Jiayi Tang, Qianli Ma, Chang Zou, Xuefei Ning, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Stable Diffusion has achieved remarkable success in the field of text-to-image generation, with its powerful generative capabilities and diverse generation results making a lasting impact. However, its iterative denoising introduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting broader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this computational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention due to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features computed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to become similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately compromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a dynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of feature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing only high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby extending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with token pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise information reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach delivered a 9$\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced image quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\times$ acceleration coupled with a notable FID reduction of 2.17.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Dong, Yueyang Li, Weiming Zeng, Lei Chen, Hongjie Yan, Wai Ting Siok, Nizhuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research.

<p>Abstract: Audio-language models (ALMs) excel in zero-shot audio classification, a task where models classify previously unseen audio clips at test time by leveraging descriptive natural language prompts. We introduce TSPE (Task-Specific Prompt Ensemble), a simple, training-free hard prompting method that boosts ALEs' zero-shot performance by customizing prompts for diverse audio classification tasks. Rather than using generic template-based prompts like "Sound of a car" we generate context-rich prompts, such as "Sound of a car coming from a tunnel". Specifically, we leverage label information to identify suitable sound attributes, such as "loud" and "feeble", and appropriate sound sources, such as "tunnel" and "street" and incorporate this information into the prompts used by Audio-Language Models (ALMs) for audio classification. Further, to enhance audio-text alignment, we perform prompt ensemble across TSPE-generated task-specific prompts. When evaluated on 12 diverse audio classification datasets, TSPE improves performance across ALMs by showing an absolute improvement of 1.23-16.36% over vanilla zero-shot evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinay Kanakeri, Aritra Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics. Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution, a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify objects in images that are well hidden in the environment due to their high similarity to the background in terms of texture and color. However, existing most boundary-guided camouflage object detection algorithms tend to generate object boundaries early in the network, and inaccurate edge priors often introduce noises in object detection. Address on this issue, we propose a novel network named B2Net aiming to enhance the accuracy of obtained boundaries by reusing boundary-aware modules at different stages of the network. Specifically, we present a Residual Feature Enhanced Module (RFEM) with the goal of integrating more discriminative feature representations to enhance detection accuracy and reliability. After that, the Boundary Aware Module (BAM) is introduced to explore edge cues twice by integrating spatial information from low-level features and semantic information from high-level features. Finally, we design the Cross-scale Boundary Fusion Module(CBFM) that integrate information across different scales in a top-down manner, merging boundary features with object features to obtain a comprehensive feature representation incorporating boundary information. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method B2Net outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely used evaluation metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Paul Lukowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding human-to-human interactions, especially in contexts like public security surveillance, is critical for monitoring and maintaining safety. Traditional activity recognition systems are limited by fixed vocabularies, predefined labels, and rigid interaction categories that often rely on choreographed videos and overlook concurrent interactive groups. These limitations make such systems less adaptable to real-world scenarios, where interactions are diverse and unpredictable. In this paper, we propose an open vocabulary human-to-human interaction recognition (OV-HHIR) framework that leverages large language models to generate open-ended textual descriptions of both seen and unseen human interactions in open-world settings without being confined to a fixed vocabulary. Additionally, we create a comprehensive, large-scale human-to-human interaction dataset by standardizing and combining existing public human interaction datasets into a unified benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional fixed-vocabulary classification systems and existing cross-modal language models for video understanding, setting the stage for more intelligent and adaptable visual understanding systems in surveillance and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianjie Luo, Jingwen Chen, Yehao Li, Yingwei Pan, Jianlin Feng, Hongyang Chao, Ting Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, zero-shot image captioning has gained increasing attention, where only text data is available for training. The remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion model presents the potential to resolve this task by employing synthetic image-caption pairs generated by this pre-trained prior. Nonetheless, the defective details in the salient regions of the synthetic images introduce semantic misalignment between the synthetic image and text, leading to compromised results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Patch-wise Cross-modal feature Mix-up (PCM) mechanism to adaptively mitigate the unfaithful contents in a fine-grained manner during training, which can be integrated into most of encoder-decoder frameworks, introducing our PCM-Net. Specifically, for each input image, salient visual concepts in the image are first detected considering the image-text similarity in CLIP space. Next, the patch-wise visual features of the input image are selectively fused with the textual features of the salient visual concepts, leading to a mixed-up feature map with less defective content. Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is exploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into the sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the model training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is devised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality counterparts. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PCM-Net compared with state-of-the-art VLMs-based approaches. It is noteworthy that our PCM-Net ranks first in both in-domain and cross-domain zero-shot image captioning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Nag</p>
<p>Abstract: Music generation has been established as a prominent topic in artificial intelligence and machine learning over recent years. In most recent works on RNN-based neural network methods have been applied for sequence generation. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their counterparts have been explored by very few researchersfor music generation.
  In this paper, a classical system was employed alongside a new system to generate creative music. Both systems were designed based on adversarial networks to generate music by learning from examples. The classical system was trained to learn a set of music pieces without differentiating between classes, whereas the new system was trained to learn the different composers and their styles to generate a creative music piece by deviating from the learned composers' styles.
  The base structure utilized was generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are capable of generating novel outputs given a set of inputs to learn from and mimic their distribution. It has been shown in previous work that GANs are limited in their original design with respect to creative outputs. Building on the Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) , this work applied them in the music domain rather than the visual art domain. Additionally, unrolled CAN was introduced to prevent mode collapse. Experiments were conducted on both GAN and CAN for generating music, and their capabilities were measured in terms of deviation from the input set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sherwin Varghese, James Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: A review of over 160,000 customer cases indicates that about 90% of time is spent by the product support for solving around 10% of subset of tickets where a trivial solution may not exist. Many of these challenging cases require the support of several engineers working together within a "swarm", and some also need to go to development support as bugs. These challenging customer issues represent a major opportunity for machine learning and knowledge graph that identifies the ideal engineer / group of engineers(swarm) that can best address the solution, reducing the wait times for the customer. The concrete ML task we consider here is a learning-to-rank(LTR) task that given an incident and a set of engineers currently assigned to the incident (which might be the empty set in the non-swarming context), produce a ranked list of engineers best fit to help resolve that incident. To calculate the rankings, we may consider a wide variety of input features including the incident description provided by the customer, the affected component(s), engineer ratings of their expertise, knowledge base article text written by engineers, response to customer text written by engineers, and historic swarming data. The central hypothesis test is that by including a holistic set of contextual data around which cases an engineer has solved, we can significantly improve the LTR algorithm over benchmark models. The article proposes a novel approach of modelling Knowledge Graph embeddings from multiple data sources, including the swarm information. The results obtained proves that by incorporating this additional context, we can improve the recommendations significantly over traditional machine learning methods like TF-IDF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Xu, Xinhao Li, Yichun Yang, Rui Huang, Limin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of perceiving fine-grained spatial and temporal information is crucial for video-language retrieval. However, the existing video retrieval benchmarks, such as MSRVTT and MSVD, fail to efficiently evaluate the fine-grained retrieval ability of video-language models (VLMs) due to a lack of detailed annotations. To address this problem, we present FIBER, a FIne-grained BEnchmark for text to video Retrieval, containing 1,000 videos sourced from the FineAction dataset. Uniquely, our FIBER benchmark provides detailed human-annotated spatial annotations and temporal annotations for each video, making it possible to independently evaluate the spatial and temporal bias of VLMs on video retrieval task. Besides, we employ a text embedding method to unlock the capability of fine-grained video-language understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Surprisingly, the experiment results show that our Video Large Language Encoder (VLLE) performs comparably to CLIP-based models on traditional benchmarks and has a stronger capability of fine-grained representation with lower spatial-temporal bias.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedram Fekri, Mehrdad Zadeh, Javad Dargahi</p>
<p>Abstract: The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the classification and detection of Silicosis-related lung inflammation. Our main contributions include 1) the creation of a newly curated chest X-ray (CXR) image dataset named SVBCX that is tailored to the nuances of lung inflammation caused by distinct agents, providing a valuable resource for silicosis and pneumonia research community; and 2) we propose a novel deep-learning architecture that integrates graph transformer networks alongside a traditional deep neural network module for the effective classification of silicosis and pneumonia. Additionally, we employ the Balanced Cross-Entropy (BalCE) as a loss function to ensure more uniform learning across different classes, enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle differences in lung conditions. The proposed model architecture and loss function selection aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of inflammation detection, particularly in the context of Silicosis. Furthermore, our research explores the efficacy of an ensemble approach that combines the strengths of diverse model architectures. Experimental results on the constructed dataset demonstrate promising outcomes, showcasing substantial enhancements compared to baseline models. The ensemble of models achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.9749 and AUC ROC scores exceeding 0.99 for each class, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in accurate and robust lung inflammation classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madeleine Darbyshire, Elizabeth Sklar, Simon Parsons</p>
<p>Abstract: Precision agriculture leverages data and machine learning so that farmers can monitor their crops and target interventions precisely. This enables the precision application of herbicide only to weeds, or the precision application of fertilizer only to undernourished crops, rather than to the entire field. The approach promises to maximize yields while minimizing resource use and harm to the surrounding environment. To this end, we propose a hierarchical panoptic segmentation method that simultaneously determines leaf count (as an identifier of plant growth)and locates weeds within an image. In particular, our approach aims to improve the segmentation of smaller instances like the leaves and weeds by incorporating focal loss and boundary loss. Not only does this result in competitive performance, achieving a PQ+ of 81.89 on the standard training set, but we also demonstrate we can improve leaf-counting accuracy with our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amira Jemaa, Adnan Rashid, Sofiene Tahar</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays an important role in improving the transparency and reliability of complex machine learning models, especially in critical domains such as cybersecurity. Despite the prevalence of heuristic interpretation methods such as SHAP and LIME, these techniques often lack formal guarantees and may produce inconsistent local explanations. To fulfill this need, few tools have emerged that use formal methods to provide formal explanations. Among these, XReason uses a SAT solver to generate formal instance-level explanation for XGBoost models. In this paper, we extend the XReason tool to support LightGBM models as well as class-level explanations. Additionally, we implement a mechanism to generate and detect adversarial examples in XReason. We evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach on the CICIDS-2017 dataset, a widely used benchmark for detecting network attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Szeider</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well at natural language tasks, they often struggle with precise formal reasoning and the rigorous specification of problems. We present MCP-Solver, a prototype implementation of the Model Context Protocol that demonstrates the potential for systematic integration between LLMs and constraint programming systems. Our implementation provides interfaces for the creation, editing, and validation of a constraint model. Through an item-based editing approach with integrated validation, the system ensures model consistency at every modification step and enables structured iterative refinement. The system handles concurrent solving sessions and maintains a persistent knowledge base of modeling insights. Initial experiments suggest that this integration can effectively combine LLMs' natural language understanding with constraint-solving capabilities. Our open-source implementation is proof of concept for integrating formal reasoning systems with LLMs through standardized protocols. While further research is needed to establish comprehensive formal guarantees, this work takes a first step toward principled integration of natural language processing with constraint-based reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research employs Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) alongside differentiable physics to model viscoelastic fluids, merging conventional differential equations, neural networks and numerical methods to reconstruct missing terms in constitutive models. This study focuses on analyzing four viscoelastic models: Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM), Johnson-Segalman, Giesekus, and Exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner (ePTT), through the use of synthetic datasets. The methodology was tested across different experimental conditions, including oscillatory and startup flows. While the UDE framework effectively predicts shear and normal stresses for most models, it demonstrates some limitations when applied to the ePTT model. The findings underscore the potential of UDEs in fluid mechanics while identifying critical areas for methodological improvement. Also, a model distillation approach was employed to extract simplified models from complex ones, emphasizing the versatility and robustness of UDEs in rheological modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqi Gao, Yixin Liu, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan, Jonathan Bragg, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating and ranking the capabilities of different LLMs is crucial for understanding their performance and alignment with human preferences. Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrien Vacher, Omar Chehab, Anna Korba</p>
<p>Abstract: In this article we provide a stochastic sampling algorithm with polynomial complexity in fixed dimension that leverages the recent advances on diffusion models where it is shown that under mild conditions, sampling can be achieved via an accurate estimation of intermediate scores across the marginals $(p_t)_{t\ge 0}$ of the standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process started at the density we wish to sample from. The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\nabla^2 \log(p_t) \succeq -\beta I_d$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\epsilon$ error in $\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7L^{d+2}\epsilon^{-2(d+3)} (L+\beta)^2d^{2(d+1)})$ time. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from a $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\alpha$-strongly log-concave distribution outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R,L,\alpha^{-1}, \epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{RL^2}, L,\alpha^{-1}, \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), many still over-rely on visual language priors present in their training data rather than true visual reasoning. To examine the situation, we introduce ViLP, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark that pairs each question with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one image whose answer can be inferred from text alone, and two images that demand visual reasoning. By leveraging image generative models, we ensure significant variation in texture, shape, conceptual combinations, hallucinated elements, and proverb-based contexts, making our benchmark images distinctly out-of-distribution. While humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA pairs and images, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on actual visual inputs and have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-context modeling is a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling them to process long-form contents with implicit memorization. Despite its advances, handling extremely long videos remains challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining crucial features over extended sequences. This paper introduces a Hierarchical visual token Compression (HiCo) method designed for high-fidelity representation and a practical context modeling system VideoChat-Flash tailored for multimodal long-sequence processing. HiCo capitalizes on the redundancy of visual information in long videos to compress long video context from the clip-level to the video-level, reducing the compute significantly while preserving essential details. VideoChat-Flash features a multi-stage short-to-long learning scheme, a rich dataset of real-world long videos named LongVid, and an upgraded "Needle-In-A-video-Haystack" (NIAH) for evaluating context capacities. In extensive experiments, VideoChat-Flash shows the leading performance on both mainstream long and short video benchmarks at the 7B model scale.

Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often focus on a limited set of values and can be resource-intensive. Furthermore, the correlation between values has been largely overlooked and remains underutilized. Our framework addresses this limitation by mining a causal graph that elucidates the implicit relationships among various values within the LLMs. Leveraging the causal graph, we implement two lightweight mechanisms for value steering: prompt template steering and Sparse Autoencoder feature steering, and analyze the effects of altering one value dimension on others. Extensive experiments conducted on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our steering methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant progress in offline video understanding. However, applying these models to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, presents unique challenges due to the need for real-time processing of continuous online video streams. To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three perspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy. First, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within online video contexts. It features six core task types across three temporal contexts-past, present, and future-forming 16 subtasks from diverse datasets. Second, we propose a new Pyramid Memory Bank (PMB) that effectively retains key spatiotemporal information in video streams. Third, we proposed an offline-to-online learning paradigm, designing an interleaved dialogue format for online video data and constructing an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for online video training. This framework led to the development of VideoChat-Online, a robust and efficient model for online video understanding. Despite the lower computational cost and higher efficiency, VideoChat-Online outperforms existing state-of-the-art offline and online models across popular offline video benchmarks and OVBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model architecture and training strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edgar Guzman, Robert D. Howe</p>
<p>Abstract: The unpredictable nature of outdoor settings introduces numerous safety concerns, making hazard detection crucial for safe navigation. This paper introduces a novel system for sidewalk safety navigation utilizing a hybrid approach that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). The system is designed to detect anomalies on sidewalks that could potentially pose walking hazards. A dataset comprising over 15,000 training frames and 5,000 testing frames was collected using video recordings, capturing various sidewalk scenarios, including normal and hazardous conditions. During deployment, the VAE utilizes its reconstruction mechanism to detect anomalies within a frame. Poor reconstruction by the VAE implies the presence of an anomaly, after which the OCSVM is used to confirm whether the anomaly is hazardous or non-hazardous. The proposed VAE model demonstrated strong performance, with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively distinguishing anomalies that could be potential hazards. The OCSVM is employed to reduce the detection of false hazard anomalies, such as manhole or water valve covers. This approach achieves an accuracy of 91.4%, providing a highly reliable system for distinguishing between hazardous and non-hazardous scenarios. These results suggest that the proposed system offers a robust solution for hazard detection in uncertain environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lung cancer is an extremely lethal disease primarily due to its late-stage diagnosis and significant mortality rate, making it the major cause of cancer-related demises globally. Machine Learning (ML) and Convolution Neural network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are primarily used for precise segmentation and classification of cancerous nodules in the CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI images. This study introduces an innovative approach to lung nodule segmentation by utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) combined with transfer learning techniques. Precise segmentation of lung nodules is crucial for the early detection of lung cancer. The proposed method leverages Bounding Box prompts and a vision transformer model to enhance segmentation performance, achieving high accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. The integration of SAM and Transfer Learning significantly improves Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems in medical imaging, particularly for lung cancer diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kateryna Melnyk, Dmytro Katrychuk, Lee Friedman, Oleg Komogortsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Eye movement prediction is a promising area of research to compensate for the latency introduced by eye-tracking systems in virtual reality devices. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the complexity of the eye movement prediction task associated with subjects. We use three fundamentally different models within the analysis: the lightweight Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), the transformer-based network for multivariate time series representation learning (TST), and the Oculomotor Plant Mathematical Model wrapped in the Kalman Filter framework (OPKF). Each solution is assessed following a sample-to-event evaluation strategy and employing the new event-to-subject metrics. Our results show that the different models maintained similar prediction performance trends pertaining to subjects. We refer to these outcomes as per-subject complexity since some subjects' data pose a more significant challenge for models. Along with the detailed correlation analysis, this report investigates the source of the per-subject complexity and discusses potential solutions to overcome it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqian Yuan, Hang Zhang, Wentong Li, Zesen Cheng, Boqiang Zhang, Long Li, Xin Li, Deli Zhao, Wenqiao Zhang, Yueting Zhuang, Jianke Zhu, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have recently exhibited remarkable capabilities in general video understanding. However, they mainly focus on holistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and temporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their advancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to empower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e., enabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video. Specially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent data engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level video instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the VideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to capture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we meticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the spatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across various aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our VideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring benchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Yang, Jiahui Huang, Yuxiao Chen, Yan Wang, Boyi Li, Yurong You, Apoorva Sharma, Maximilian Igl, Peter Karkus, Danfei Xu, Boris Ivanovic, Yue Wang, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: We present STORM, a spatio-temporal reconstruction model designed for reconstructing dynamic outdoor scenes from sparse observations. Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchuan Tian, Jing Han, Chengcheng Wang, Yuchen Liang, Chao Xu, Hanting Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown exceptional performance in visual generation tasks. Recently, these models have shifted from traditional U-Shaped CNN-Attention hybrid structures to fully transformer-based isotropic architectures. While these transformers exhibit strong scalability and performance, their reliance on complicated self-attention operation results in slow inference speeds. Contrary to these works, we rethink one of the simplest yet fastest module in deep learning, 3x3 Convolution, to construct a scaled-up purely convolutional diffusion model. We first discover that an Encoder-Decoder Hourglass design outperforms scalable isotropic architectures for Conv3x3, but still under-performing our expectation. Further improving the architecture, we introduce sparse skip connections to reduce redundancy and improve scalability. Based on the architecture, we introduce conditioning improvements including stage-specific embeddings, mid-block condition injection, and conditional gating. These improvements lead to our proposed Diffusion CNN (DiC), which serves as a swift yet competitive diffusion architecture baseline. Experiments on various scales and settings show that DiC surpasses existing diffusion transformers by considerable margins in terms of performance while keeping a good speed advantage.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah M. Hooper, Hui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Biomedical imaging modalities often produce high-resolution, multi-dimensional images that pose computational challenges for deep neural networks. These computational challenges are compounded when training transformers due to the self-attention operator, which scales quadratically with context length. Recent developments in long-context models have potential to alleviate these difficulties and enable more efficient application of transformers to large biomedical images, although a systematic evaluation on this topic is lacking. In this study, we investigate the impact of context length on biomedical image analysis and we evaluate the performance of recently proposed long-context models. We first curate a suite of biomedical imaging datasets, including 2D and 3D data for segmentation, denoising, and classification tasks. We then analyze the impact of context length on network performance using the Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer by varying patch size and attention window size. Our findings reveal a strong relationship between context length and performance, particularly for pixel-level prediction tasks. Finally, we show that recent long-context models demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency while maintaining comparable performance, though we highlight where gaps remain. This work underscores the potential and challenges of using long-context models in biomedical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: This article considers the impact of different thresholding methods to the Nearest Shrunken Centroid algorithm, which is popularly referred as the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) for high-dimensional classification. PAM uses soft thresholding to achieve high computational efficiency and high classification accuracy but in the price of retaining too many features. When applied to microarray human cancers, PAM selected 2611 features on average from 10 multi-class datasets. Such a large number of features make it difficult to perform follow up study. One reason behind this problem is the soft thresholding, which is known to produce biased parameter estimate in regression analysis. In this article, we extend the PAM algorithm with two other thresholding methods, hard and order thresholding, and a deep search algorithm to achieve better thresholding parameter estimate. The modified algorithms are extensively tested and compared to the original one based on real data and Monte Carlo studies. In general, the modification not only gave better cancer status prediction accuracy, but also resulted in more parsimonious models with significantly smaller number of features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianfu Wang, Mingyang Xie, Haoming Cai, Sachin Shah, Christopher A. Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: Transparent surfaces, such as glass, create complex reflections that obscure images and challenge downstream computer vision applications. We introduce Flash-Split, a robust framework for separating transmitted and reflected light using a single (potentially misaligned) pair of flash/no-flash images. Our core idea is to perform latent-space reflection separation while leveraging the flash cues. Specifically, Flash-Split consists of two stages. Stage 1 separates apart the reflection latent and transmission latent via a dual-branch diffusion model conditioned on an encoded flash/no-flash latent pair, effectively mitigating the flash/no-flash misalignment issue. Stage 2 restores high-resolution, faithful details to the separated latents, via a cross-latent decoding process conditioned on the original images before separation. By validating Flash-Split on challenging real-world scenes, we demonstrate state-of-the-art reflection separation performance and significantly outperform the baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose SoundBrush, a model that uses sound as a brush to edit and manipulate visual scenes. We extend the generative capabilities of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to incorporate audio information for editing visual scenes. Inspired by existing image-editing works, we frame this task as a supervised learning problem and leverage various off-the-shelf models to construct a sound-paired visual scene dataset for training. This richly generated dataset enables SoundBrush to learn to map audio features into the textual space of the LDM, allowing for visual scene editing guided by diverse in-the-wild sound. Unlike existing methods, SoundBrush can accurately manipulate the overall scenery or even insert sounding objects to best match the audio inputs while preserving the original content. Furthermore, by integrating with novel view synthesis techniques, our framework can be extended to edit 3D scenes, facilitating sound-driven 3D scene manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suttisak Wizadwongsa, Jinfan Zhou, Edward Li, Jeong Joon Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent AI-based 3D content creation has largely evolved along two paths: feed-forward image-to-3D reconstruction approaches and 3D generative models trained with 2D or 3D supervision. In this work, we show that existing feed-forward reconstruction methods can serve as effective latent encoders for training 3D generative models, thereby bridging these two paradigms. By reusing powerful pre-trained reconstruction models, we avoid computationally expensive encoder network training and obtain rich 3D latent features for generative modeling for free. However, the latent spaces of reconstruction models are not well-suited for generative modeling due to their unstructured nature. To enable flow-based model training on these latent features, we develop post-processing pipelines, including protocols to standardize the features and spatial weighting to concentrate on important regions. We further incorporate a 2D image space perceptual rendering loss to handle the high-dimensional latent spaces. Finally, we propose a multi-stream transformer-based rectified flow architecture to achieve linear scaling and high-quality text-conditioned 3D generation. Our framework leverages the advancements of feed-forward reconstruction models to enhance the scalability of 3D generative modeling, achieving both high computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in text-to-3D generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Instruction Tuning typically requires a large amount of vision-language training data. This data often containing redundant information that increases computational costs without proportional performance gains. In this work, we introduce ICONS, a gradient-driven Influence CONsensus approach for vision-language data Selection that selects a compact training dataset for efficient multi-task training. The key element of our approach is cross-task influence consensus, which uses majority voting across task-specific influence matrices to identify samples that are consistently valuable across multiple tasks, allowing us to effectively prioritize data that optimizes for overall performance. Experiments show that models trained on our selected data (20% of LLaVA-665K) achieve 98.6% of the relative performance obtained using the full dataset. Additionally, we release this subset, LLaVA-ICONS-133K, a compact yet highly informative subset of LLaVA-665K visual instruction tuning data, preserving high impact training data for efficient vision-language model development.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00655">Finding Missed Code Size Optimizations in Compilers using LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Italiano, Chris Cummins</p>
<p>Abstract: Compilers are complex, and significant effort has been expended on testing them. Techniques such as random program generation and differential testing have proved highly effective and have uncovered thousands of bugs in production compilers. The majority of effort has been expended on validating that a compiler produces correct code for a given input, while less attention has been paid to ensuring that the compiler produces performant code.
  In this work we adapt differential testing to the task of identifying missed optimization opportunities in compilers. We develop a novel testing approach which combines large language models (LLMs) with a series of differential testing strategies and use them to find missing code size optimizations in C / C++ compilers.
  The advantage of our approach is its simplicity. We offload the complex task of generating random code to an off-the-shelf LLM, and use heuristics and analyses to identify anomalous compiler behavior. Our approach requires fewer than 150 lines of code to implement. This simplicity makes it extensible. By simply changing the target compiler and initial LLM prompt we port the approach from C / C++ to Rust and Swift, finding bugs in both. To date we have reported 24 confirmed bugs in production compilers, and conclude that LLM-assisted testing is a promising avenue for detecting optimization bugs in real world compilers.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present OLMo 2, the next generation of our fully open language models. OLMo 2 includes dense autoregressive models with improved architecture and training recipe, pretraining data mixtures, and instruction tuning recipes. Our modified model architecture and training recipe achieve both better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e. specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from T\"ulu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance to compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight only models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe. Our fully open OLMo 2-Instruct models are competitive with or surpassing open-weight only models of comparable size, including Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2. We release all OLMo 2 artifacts openly -- models at 7B and 13B scales, both pretrained and post-trained, including their full training data, training code and recipes, training logs and thousands of intermediate checkpoints.

<p>Abstract: Generative models hold great potential, but only if one can trust the evaluation of the data they generate. We show that many commonly used quality scores for comparing two-dimensional distributions of synthetic vs. ground-truth data give better results than they should, a phenomenon we call the "grade inflation problem." We show that the correlation score, Jaccard score, earth-mover's score, and Kullback-Leibler (relative-entropy) score all suffer grade inflation. We propose that any score that values all datapoints equally, as these do, will also exhibit grade inflation; we refer to such scores as "equipoint" scores. We introduce the concept of "equidensity" scores, and present the Eden score, to our knowledge the first example of such a score. We found that Eden avoids grade inflation and agrees better with human perception of goodness-of-fit than the equipoint scores above. We propose that any reasonable equidensity score will avoid grade inflation. We identify a connection between equidensity scores and R\'enyi entropy of negative order. We conclude that equidensity scores are likely to outperform equipoint scores for generative models, and for comparing low-dimensional distributions more generally.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised numerous fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) having a strong generalisation ability that offers accessible solutions directly without the need for costly training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for task solving directly (in vivo), this paper explores its potential in in-vitro applications. These involve using LLM to generate labels to help the supervised training of mainstream models by (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation with LLM-generated labels. In this paper, we evaluate this approach in the emerging field of empathy computing -- automating the prediction of psychological questionnaire outcomes from inputs like text sequences. Specifically, crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. By leveraging LLM-generated labels to train pre-trained language models (PLMs) like RoBERTa, we achieve statistically significant accuracy improvements over baselines, achieving a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on NewsEmp benchmarks. In addition, we bring insightful discussions, including current challenges in empathy computing, data biases in training data and evaluation metric selection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Wu, Sheng Sun, Yuwei Wang, Min Liu, Ke Xu, Quyang Pan, Bo Gao, Tian Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of End-Edge-Cloud Collaboration (EECC) offers a promising paradigm for Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training across end devices, edge servers, and cloud data centers, providing enhanced reliability and reduced latency. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) can benefit from this paradigm by enabling multi-tier model aggregation across distributed computing nodes. However, the potential of HFL is significantly constrained by the inherent heterogeneity and dynamic characteristics of EECC environments. Specifically, the uniform model structure bounded by the least powerful end device across all computing nodes imposes a performance bottleneck. Meanwhile, coupled heterogeneity in data distributions and resource capabilities across tiers disrupts hierarchical knowledge transfer, leading to biased updates and degraded performance. Furthermore, the mobility and fluctuating connectivity of computing nodes in EECC environments introduce complexities in dynamic node migration, further compromising the robustness of the training process. To address multiple challenges within a unified framework, we propose End-Edge-Cloud Federated Learning with Self-Rectified Knowledge Agglomeration (FedEEC), which is a novel EECC-empowered FL framework that allows the trained models from end, edge, to cloud to grow larger in size and stronger in generalization ability. FedEEC introduces two key innovations: (1) Bridge Sample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which enables knowledge transfer between neighboring nodes through generated bridge samples, and (2) Self-Knowledge Rectification (SKR), which refines the transferred knowledge to prevent suboptimal cloud model optimization. The proposed framework effectively handles both cross-tier resource heterogeneity and effective knowledge transfer between neighboring nodes, while satisfying the migration-resilient requirements of EECC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Zhu, Peihao Wang, Ruisi Cai, Jason D. Lee, Pan Li, Zhangyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers rely on both content-based and position-based addressing mechanisms to make predictions, but existing positional encoding techniques often diminish the effectiveness of position-based addressing. Many current methods enforce rigid patterns in attention maps, limiting the ability to model long-range dependencies and adapt to diverse tasks. Additionally, most positional encodings are learned as general biases, lacking the specialization required for different instances within a dataset. To address this, we propose con$\textbf{T}$extualized equivari$\textbf{A}$nt $\textbf{P}$osition $\textbf{E}$mbedding ($\textbf{TAPE}$), a novel framework that enhances positional embeddings by incorporating sequence content across layers. TAPE introduces dynamic, context-aware positional encodings, overcoming the constraints of traditional fixed patterns. By enforcing permutation and orthogonal equivariance, TAPE ensures the stability of positional encodings during updates, improving robustness and adaptability. Our method can be easily integrated into pre-trained transformers, offering parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments shows that TAPE achieves superior performance in language modeling, arithmetic reasoning, and long-context retrieval tasks compared to existing positional embedding techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianchao Xiu, Anning Yang, Chenyi Huang, Xinrong Li, Wanquan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is widely applied in machine learning and pattern recognition. However, most of the existing methods only consider a single sparsity, which makes it difficult to select valuable and discriminative feature subsets from the original high-dimensional feature set. In this paper, we propose a new UFS method called DSCOFS via embedding double sparsity constrained optimization into the classical principal component analysis (PCA) framework. Double sparsity refers to using $\ell_{2,0}$-norm and $\ell_0$-norm to simultaneously constrain variables, by adding the sparsity of different types, to achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of identifying differential features. The core is that $\ell_{2,0}$-norm can remove irrelevant and redundant features, while $\ell_0$-norm can filter out irregular noisy features, thereby complementing $\ell_{2,0}$-norm to improve discrimination. An effective proximal alternating minimization method is proposed to solve the resulting nonconvex nonsmooth model. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the sequence generated by our method globally converges to a stationary point. Numerical experiments on three synthetic datasets and eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and convergence of the proposed method. In particular, the average clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) are improved by at least 3.34% and 3.02%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, two common statistical tests and a new feature similarity metric verify the advantages of double sparsity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayur Shirke, Amey Shembade, Madhushri Wagh, Pavan Thorat, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of layer pruning for developing more efficient BERT models tailored to specific downstream tasks in low-resource languages. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether pruned BERT models can maintain high performance while reducing model size and complexity. We experiment with several BERT variants, including MahaBERT-v2 and Google-Muril, applying different pruning strategies and comparing their performance to smaller, scratch-trained models like MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller. We fine-tune these models on Marathi datasets, specifically Short Headlines Classification (SHC), Long Paragraph Classification (LPC) and Long Document Classification (LDC), to assess their classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that pruned models, despite having fewer layers, achieve comparable performance to their fully-layered counterparts while consistently outperforming scratch-trained models of similar size. Notably, pruning layers from the middle of the model proves to be the most effective strategy, offering performance competitive with pruning from the top and bottom. However, there is no clear winner, as different pruning strategies perform better in different model and dataset combinations. Additionally, monolingual BERT models outperform multilingual ones in these experiments. This approach, which reduces computational demands, provides a faster and more efficient alternative to training smaller models from scratch, making advanced NLP models more accessible for low-resource languages without compromising classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Arima, Satoshi Kagiwada, Hitoshi Iyatomi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies on plant disease diagnosis using machine learning (ML) have highlighted concerns about the overestimated diagnostic performance due to inappropriate data partitioning, where training and test datasets are derived from the same source (domain). Plant disease diagnosis presents a challenging classification task, characterized by its fine-grained nature, vague symptoms, and the extensive variability of image features within each domain. In this study, we propose the concept of Discriminative Difficulty Distance (DDD), a novel metric designed to quantify the domain gap between training and test datasets while assessing the classification difficulty of test data. DDD provides a valuable tool for identifying insufficient diversity in training data, thus supporting the development of more diverse and robust datasets. We investigated multiple image encoders trained on different datasets and examined whether the distances between datasets, measured using low-dimensional representations generated by the encoders, are suitable as a DDD metric. The study utilized 244,063 plant disease images spanning four crops and 34 disease classes collected from 27 domains. As a result, we demonstrated that even if the test images are from different crops or diseases than those used to train the encoder, incorporating them allows the construction of a distance measure for a dataset that strongly correlates with the difficulty of diagnosis indicated by the disease classifier developed independently. Compared to the base encoder, pre-trained only on ImageNet21K, the correlation higher by 0.106 to 0.485, reaching a maximum of 0.909.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Minor, Daniel A. Messenger, Vanja Dukic, David M. Bortz</p>
<p>Abstract: The multiscale and turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere has historically rendered accurate weather modeling a hard problem. Recently, there has been an explosion of interest surrounding data-driven approaches to weather modeling, which in many cases show improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to traditional methods. However, many of the current data-driven approaches employ highly parameterized neural networks, often resulting in uninterpretable models and limited gains in scientific understanding. In this work, we address the interpretability problem by explicitly discovering partial differential equations governing various weather phenomena, identifying symbolic mathematical models with direct physical interpretations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, in particular, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm can learn effective weather models from both simulated and assimilated data. Our approach adapts the standard WSINDy algorithm to work with high-dimensional fluid data of arbitrary spatial dimension. Moreover, we develop an approach for handling terms that are not integrable-by-parts, such as advection operators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edric Tam, Barbara E Engelhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models are ubiquitous in modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Recent advances have led to a variety of generative modeling approaches that are capable of synthesizing highly realistic samples. Despite these developments, evaluating the distributional match between the synthetic samples and the target distribution in a statistically principled way remains a core challenge. We focus on evaluating image generative models, where studies often treat human evaluation as the gold standard. Commonly adopted metrics, such as the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), do not sufficiently capture the differences between the learned and target distributions, because the assumption of normality ignores differences in the tails. We propose the Embedded Characteristic Score (ECS), a comprehensive metric for evaluating the distributional match between the learned and target sample distributions, and explore its connection with moments and tail behavior. We derive natural properties of ECS and show its practical use via simulations and an empirical study.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00755">An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Liu, Wing Hung Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome variables. The core innovation of CausalBGM lies in its ability to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning individual-specific distributions of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This approach not only effectively mitigates confounding effects but also provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, offering reliable and interpretable causal effect estimates at the individual level. CausalBGM adopts a Bayesian model and uses a novel iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the posterior distribution of latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. Its Bayesian foundation ensures statistical rigor, providing robust and well-calibrated posterior intervals. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in modern applications in fields such as genomics, healthcare, and social sciences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dinesh Srivasthav P, Manoj Apte</p>
<p>Abstract: For different factors/reasons, ranging from inherent characteristics and features providing decentralization, enhanced privacy, ease of transactions, etc., to implied external hardships in enforcing regulations, contradictions in data sharing policies, etc., cryptocurrencies have been severely abused for carrying out numerous malicious and illicit activities including money laundering, darknet transactions, scams, terrorism financing, arm trades. However, money laundering is a key crime to be mitigated to also suspend the movement of funds from other illicit activities. Billions of dollars are annually being laundered. It is getting extremely difficult to identify money laundering in crypto transactions owing to many layering strategies available today, and rapidly evolving tactics, and patterns the launderers use to obfuscate the illicit funds. Many detection methods have been proposed ranging from naive approaches involving complete manual investigation to machine learning models. However, there are very limited datasets available for effectively training machine learning models. Also, the existing datasets are static and class-imbalanced, posing challenges for scalability and suitability to specific scenarios, due to lack of customization to varying requirements. This has been a persistent challenge in literature. In this paper, we propose behavior embedded entity-specific money laundering-like transaction simulation that helps in generating various transaction types and models the transactions embedding the behavior of several entities observed in this space. The paper discusses the design and architecture of the simulator, a custom dataset we generated using the simulator, and the performance of models trained on this synthetic data in detecting real addresses involved in money laundering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulong Li, Yuxuan Zhang, Feilong Tang, Mian Zhou, Zhixiang Lu, Haochen Xue, Yifang Wang, Kang Dang, Jionglong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Although sign language recognition aids non-hearing-impaired understanding, many hearing-impaired individuals still rely on sign language alone due to limited literacy, underscoring the need for advanced sign language production and translation (SLP and SLT) systems. In the field of sign language production, the lack of adequate models and datasets restricts practical applications. Existing models face challenges in production accuracy and pose control, making it difficult to provide fluent sign language expressions across diverse scenarios. Additionally, data resources are scarce, particularly high-quality datasets with complete sign vocabulary and pose annotations. To address these issues, we introduce CNText2Sign and CNSign, comprehensive datasets to benchmark SLP and SLT, respectively, with CNText2Sign covering gloss and landmark mappings for SLP, and CNSign providing extensive video-to-text data for SLT. To improve the accuracy and applicability of sign language systems, we propose the AuraLLM and SignMST-C models. AuraLLM, incorporating LoRA and RAG techniques, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 50.41 on the CNText2Sign dataset, enabling precise control over gesture semantics and motion. SignMST-C employs self-supervised rapid motion video pretraining, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 31.03/32.08 on the PHOENIX2014-T benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art. These models establish robust baselines for the datasets released for their respective tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Wang, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Luis Felipe Villa-Arenas, Sebastian M\"oller, Vera Schmitt</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Nguyen, Spencer Htin</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of beauty filters on social media, which enhance the appearance of individuals in images, is a well-researched area, with existing methods proving to be highly effective. Traditionally, such enhancements are performed using rule-based approaches that leverage domain knowledge of facial features associated with attractiveness, applying very specific transformations to maximize these attributes. In this work, we present an alternative approach that projects facial images as points on the latent space of a pre-trained GAN, which are then optimized to produce beautiful faces. The movement of the latent points is guided by a newly developed facial beauty evaluation regression network, which learns to distinguish attractive facial features, outperforming many existing facial beauty evaluation models in this domain. By using this data-driven approach, our method can automatically capture holistic patterns in beauty directly from data rather than relying on predefined rules, enabling more dynamic and potentially broader applications of facial beauty editing. This work demonstrates a potential new direction for automated aesthetic enhancement, offering a complementary alternative to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianang Zhou, Junhui Hou, Meiyi Yang, Yongjian Deng, Youfu Li, Junlin Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joakim Blach Andersen, Qingyuan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential decision problems are widely studied across many areas of science. A key challenge when learning policies from historical data - a practice commonly referred to as off-policy learning - is how to ``identify'' the impact of a policy of interest when the observed data are not randomized. Off-policy learning has mainly been studied in two settings: dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), where the focus is on controlling confounding in medical problems with short decision horizons, and offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the focus is on dimension reduction in closed systems such as games. The gap between these two well studied settings has limited the wider application of off-policy learning to many real-world problems. Using the theory for causal inference based on acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMGs), we provide a set of graphical identification criteria in general decision processes that encompass both DTRs and MDPs. We discuss how our results relate to the often implicit causal assumptions made in the DTR and RL literatures and further clarify several common misconceptions. Finally, we present a realistic simulation study for the dynamic pricing problem encountered in container logistics, and demonstrate how violations of our graphical criteria can lead to suboptimal policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The embedded topic model (ETM) is a widely used approach that assumes the sampled document-topic distribution conforms to the logistic normal distribution for easier optimization. However, this assumption oversimplifies the real document-topic distribution, limiting the model's performance. In response, we propose a novel method that introduces the diffusion process into the sampling process of document-topic distribution to overcome this limitation and maintain an easy optimization process. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two mainstream datasets, proving its effectiveness in improving topic modeling performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to document an effective way to improve multimodal co-learning by using aggressive modality dropout. We find that by using aggressive modality dropout we are able to reverse negative co-learning (NCL) to positive co-learning (PCL). Aggressive modality dropout can be used to "prep" a multimodal model for unimodal deployment, and dramatically increases model performance during negative co-learning, where during some experiments we saw a 20% gain in accuracy. We also benchmark our modality dropout technique against PCL to show that our modality drop out technique improves co-learning during PCL, although it does not have as much as an substantial effect as it does during NCL.

<p>Abstract: Capitalizing on the complementary advantages of generative and discriminative models has always been a compelling vision in machine learning, backed by a growing body of research. This work discloses the hidden semantic structure within score-based generative models, unveiling their potential as effective discriminative priors. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose DUSA to exploit the structured semantic priors underlying diffusion score to facilitate the test-time adaptation of image classifiers or dense predictors. Notably, DUSA extracts knowledge from a single timestep of denoising diffusion, lifting the curse of Monte Carlo-based likelihood estimation over timesteps. We demonstrate the efficacy of our DUSA in adapting a wide variety of competitive pre-trained discriminative models on diverse test-time scenarios. Additionally, a thorough ablation study is conducted to dissect the pivotal elements in DUSA. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/DUSA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Oral cancer constitutes a significant global health concern, resulting in 277,484 fatalities in 2023, with the highest prevalence observed in low- and middle-income nations. Facilitating automation in the detection of possibly malignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity could result in cost-effective and early disease diagnosis. Establishing an extensive repository of meticulously annotated oral lesions is essential. In this research photos are being collected from global clinical experts, who have been equipped with an annotation tool to generate comprehensive labelling. This research presents a novel approach for integrating bounding box annotations from various doctors. Additionally, Deep Belief Network combined with CAPSNET is employed to develop automated systems that extracted intricate patterns to address this challenging problem. This study evaluated two deep learning-based computer vision methodologies for the automated detection and classification of oral lesions to facilitate the early detection of oral cancer: image classification utilizing CAPSNET. Image classification attained an F1 score of 94.23% for detecting photos with lesions 93.46% for identifying images necessitating referral. Object detection attained an F1 score of 89.34% for identifying lesions for referral. Subsequent performances are documented about classification based on the sort of referral decision. Our preliminary findings indicate that deep learning possesses the capability to address this complex problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron C. Yetman</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraordinary success of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse array of tasks has led to an explosion of scientific and philosophical theorizing aimed at explaining how they do what they do. Unfortunately, disagreement over fundamental theoretical issues has led to stalemate, with entrenched camps of LLM optimists and pessimists often committed to very different views of how these systems work. Overcoming stalemate requires agreement on fundamental questions, and the goal of this paper is to address one such question, namely: is LLM behavior driven partly by representation-based information processing of the sort implicated in biological cognition, or is it driven entirely by processes of memorization and stochastic table look-up? This is a question about what kind of algorithm LLMs implement, and the answer carries serious implications for higher level questions about whether these systems have beliefs, intentions, concepts, knowledge, and understanding. I argue that LLM behavior is partially driven by representation-based information processing, and then I describe and defend a series of practical techniques for investigating these representations and developing explanations on their basis. The resulting account provides a groundwork for future theorizing about language models and their successors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ouhan Huang, Huanle Rao, Xiaowen Cai, Tianyun Wang, Aolong Sun, Sizhe Xing, Yifan Sun, Gangyong Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting vehicle behavior within complex traffic environments is pivotal within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Briden, Trey Gurga, Breanna Johnson, Abhishek Cauligi, Richard Linares</p>
<p>Abstract: This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx), an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG), generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx) formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Zhang, Hang Zhang, Xin Li, Jiashuo Sun, Yongliang Shen, Weiming Lu, Deli Zhao, Yueting Zhuang, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving~\footnote{Our code are available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook}}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepehr Dehdashtian, Gautam Sreekumar, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Images generated by text-to-image (T2I) models often exhibit visual biases and stereotypes of concepts such as culture and profession. Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: (M1) Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and (M2) WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: (U1) StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and (U2) SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes. Additionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower Internet footprints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo D. Gonz\'alez, Victor M. Zavala</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is an effective paradigm for the optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. Standard BO learns the performance of a system $f(x)$ by using a Gaussian Process (GP) model; this treats the system as a black-box and limits its ability to exploit available structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections in a complex system). Grey-box modeling, wherein the performance function is treated as a composition of known and unknown intermediate functions $f(x, y(x))$ (where $y(x)$ is a GP model) offers a solution to this limitation; however, generating an analytical probability density for $f$ from the Gaussian density of $y(x)$ is often an intractable problem (e.g., when $f$ is nonlinear). Previous work has handled this issue by using sampling techniques or by solving an auxiliary problem over an augmented space where the values of $y(x)$ are constrained by confidence intervals derived from the GP models; such solutions are computationally intensive. In this work, we provide a detailed implementation of a recently proposed grey-box BO paradigm, BOIS, that uses adaptive linearizations of $f$ to obtain analytical expressions for the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that the BOIS approach enables the exploitation of structural knowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. We benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and existing grey-box BO algorithms using a pair of case studies focused on chemical process optimization and design. Our results indicate that BOIS performs as well as or better than existing grey-box methods, while also being less computationally intensive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Silver, Ron Kimmel</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of video compression, the pursuit for better quality at lower bit rates remains a long-lasting goal. Recent developments have demonstrated the potential of Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a promising alternative to traditional transform-based methodologies. Video INRs can be roughly divided into frame-wise and pixel-wise methods according to the structure the network outputs. While the pixel-based methods are better for upsampling and parallelization, frame-wise methods demonstrated better performance. We introduce CoordFlow, a novel pixel-wise INR for video compression. It yields state-of-the-art results compared to other pixel-wise INRs and on-par performance compared to leading frame-wise techniques. The method is based on the separation of the visual information into visually consistent layers, each represented by a dedicated network that compensates for the layer's motion. When integrated, a byproduct is an unsupervised segmentation of video sequence. Objects motion trajectories are implicitly utilized to compensate for visual-temporal redundancies. Additionally, the proposed method provides inherent video upsampling, stabilization, inpainting, and denoising capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhao Huang, Xue Jiang, Zhiqiang Wang, Wentao Mo, Xi Xiao, Bo Han, Yongjie Yin, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models--a common and practical real world scenario--remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for VideoQA tasks, respectively. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Feng, Wei Li, DiDi Zhu, Hangjie Yuan, Wendi Zheng, Dan Zhang, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Backpropagation provides a generalized configuration for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Like, SGD and Adam are commonly used for weight updates in continual learning and continual pre-training. In practice, permission to access gradient information is not always granted (the gradient ban), such as black-box APIs, hardware limitations, and non-differentiable systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark ZeroFlow to evaluate gradient-free optimization algorithms for overcoming forgetting. This benchmark examines a suite of forward pass methods across multiple methods, forgetting scenarios, and datasets. We find that forward passes alone are enough to overcome forgetting. Our findings reveal new optimization principles that highlight the potential of forward-pass in mitigating forgetting, managing task conflicts, and reducing memory demands, alongside novel enhancements that further mitigate forgetting with just one forward pass. This work provides essential insights and tools for advancing forward pass methods to overcome forgetting.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing necessity for enhanced processing capabilities in edge devices with limited resources has led us to develop effective methods for improving high-performance computing (HPC) applications. In this paper, we introduce LASP (Lightweight Autotuning of Scientific Application Parameters), a novel strategy designed to address the parameter search space challenge in edge devices. Our strategy employs a multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique focused on online exploration and exploitation. Notably, LASP takes a dynamic approach, adapting seamlessly to changing environments. We tested LASP with four HPC applications: Lulesh, Kripke, Clomp, and Hypre. Its lightweight nature makes it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices. By employing the MAB framework to efficiently navigate the search space, we achieved significant performance improvements while adhering to the stringent computational limits of edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LASP in optimizing parameter search on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanwen Huang, Yong Zhang, Ning Cheng, Zhitao Li, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from context faithfulness hallucinations, where outputs deviate from retrieved information due to insufficient context utilization and high output uncertainty. Our uncertainty evaluation experiments reveal a strong correlation between high uncertainty and hallucinations. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms encode signals indicative of contextual utilization, validated through probing analysis. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Attention-Guided Context Decoding (DAGCD), a lightweight framework that integrates attention distributions and uncertainty signals in a single-pass decoding process. Experiments across QA datasets demonstrate DAGCD's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in faithfulness and robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Hu (Zhilu),  Luc (Zhilu),  Chen, Yiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The nature of modern data is increasingly real-time, making outlier detection crucial in any data-related field, such as finance for fraud detection and healthcare for monitoring patient vitals. Traditional outlier detection methods, such as the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, struggle with real-time data due to the need for extensive recalculations with each new data point, limiting their application in real-time environments. While the Incremental LOF (ILOF) algorithm has been developed to tackle the challenges of online anomaly detection, it remains computationally expensive when processing large streams of data points, and its detection performance may degrade after a certain threshold of points have streamed in. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of LOF algorithms for online anomaly detection, named the Efficient Incremental LOF (EILOF) algorithm. The EILOF algorithm only computes the LOF scores of new points without altering the LOF scores of existing data points. Although exact LOF scores have not yet been computed for the existing points in the new algorithm, datasets often contain noise, and minor deviations in LOF score calculations do not necessarily degrade detection performance. In fact, such deviations can sometimes enhance outlier detection. We systematically tested this approach on both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that EILOF outperforms ILOF as the volume of streaming data increases across various scenarios. The EILOF algorithm not only significantly reduces computational costs, but also systematically improves detection accuracy when the number of additional points increases compared to the ILOF algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Osama, Ashim Dey, Kawsar Ahmed, Muhammad Ashad Kabir</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic text summarization, particularly headline generation, remains a critical yet underexplored area for Bengali religious news. Existing approaches to headline generation typically rely solely on the article content, overlooking crucial contextual features such as sentiment, category, and aspect. This limitation significantly hinders their effectiveness and overall performance. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel corpus, BeliN (Bengali Religious News) - comprising religious news articles from prominent Bangladeshi online newspapers, and MultiGen - a contextual multi-input feature fusion headline generation approach. Leveraging transformer-based pre-trained language models such as BanglaT5, mBART, mT5, and mT0, MultiGen integrates additional contextual features - including category, aspect, and sentiment - with the news content. This fusion enables the model to capture critical contextual information often overlooked by traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MultiGen over the baseline approach that uses only news content, achieving a BLEU score of 18.61 and ROUGE-L score of 24.19, compared to baseline approach scores of 16.08 and 23.08, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating contextual features in headline generation for low-resource languages. By bridging linguistic and cultural gaps, this research advances natural language processing for Bengali and other underrepresented languages.

<p>Abstract: Transferable adversarial examples highlight the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to imperceptible perturbations across various real-world applications. While there have been notable advancements in untargeted transferable attacks, targeted transferable attacks remain a significant challenge. In this work, we focus on generative approaches for targeted transferable attacks. Current generative attacks focus on reducing overfitting to surrogate models and the source data domain, but they often overlook the importance of enhancing transferability through additional semantics. To address this issue, we introduce a novel plug-and-play module into the general generator architecture to enhance adversarial transferability. Specifically, we propose a \emph{Semantic Injection Module} (SIM) that utilizes the semantics contained in an additional guiding image to improve transferability. The guiding image provides a simple yet effective method to incorporate target semantics from the target class to create targeted and highly transferable attacks. Additionally, we propose new loss formulations that can integrate the semantic injection module more effectively for both targeted and untargeted attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under both targeted and untargeted attack settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) in various music informatics understanding tasks, including music tagging, instrument classification, key detection, and more. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Zeng, Sujay Bhatt, Alec Koppel, Sumitra Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanism design in resource allocation studies dividing limited resources among self-interested agents whose satisfaction with the allocation depends on privately held utilities. We consider the problem in a payment-free setting, with the aim of maximizing social welfare while enforcing incentive compatibility (IC), i.e., agents cannot inflate allocations by misreporting their utilities. The well-known proportional fairness (PF) mechanism achieves the maximum possible social welfare but incurs an undesirably high exploitability (the maximum unilateral inflation in utility from misreport and a measure of deviation from IC). In fact, it is known that no mechanism can achieve the maximum social welfare and exact incentive compatibility (IC) simultaneously without the use of monetary incentives (Cole et al., 2013). Motivated by this fact, we propose learning an approximate mechanism that desirably trades off the competing objectives. Our main contribution is to design an innovative neural network architecture tailored to the resource allocation problem, which we name Regularized Proportional Fairness Network (RPF-Net). RPF-Net regularizes the output of the PF mechanism by a learned function approximator of the most exploitable allocation, with the aim of reducing the incentive for any agent to misreport. We derive generalization bounds that guarantee the mechanism performance when trained under finite and out-of-distribution samples and experimentally demonstrate the merits of the proposed mechanism compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rofiqul Islam, Nihad Karim Chowdhury, Muhammad Ashad Kabir</p>
<p>Abstract: This research presents a robust approach to classifying COVID-19 cough sounds using cutting-edge machine-learning techniques. Leveraging deep neural decision trees and deep neural decision forests, our methodology demonstrates consistent performance across diverse cough sound datasets. We begin with a comprehensive extraction of features to capture a wide range of audio features from individuals, whether COVID-19 positive or negative. To determine the most important features, we use recursive feature elimination along with cross-validation. Bayesian optimization fine-tunes hyper-parameters of deep neural decision tree and deep neural decision forest models. Additionally, we integrate the SMOTE during training to ensure a balanced representation of positive and negative data. Model performance refinement is achieved through threshold optimization, maximizing the ROC-AUC score. Our approach undergoes a comprehensive evaluation in five datasets: Cambridge, Coswara, COUGHVID, Virufy, and the combined Virufy with the NoCoCoDa dataset. Consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach yields notable AUC scores of 0.97, 0.98, 0.92, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.99 across the respective datasets. Merging all datasets into a combined dataset, our method, using a deep neural decision forest classifier, achieves an AUC of 0.97. Also, our study includes a comprehensive cross-datasets analysis, revealing demographic and geographic differences in the cough sounds associated with COVID-19. These differences highlight the challenges in transferring learned features across diverse datasets and underscore the potential benefits of dataset integration, improving generalizability and enhancing COVID-19 detection from audio signals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has been attracting attention by methods for modeling multi-turn contexts. The multi-turn input to a pretraining model implicitly assumes that the current turn and other turns are distinguished during the training process by inserting special tokens into the input sequence. This paper proposes a priority-based attention method to distinguish each turn explicitly by adding dialogue features into the attention mechanism, called Turn Emphasis with Dialogue (TED). It has a priority for each turn according to turn position and speaker information as dialogue features. It takes multi-head self-attention between turn-based vectors for multi-turn input and adjusts attention scores with the dialogue features. We evaluate TED on four typical benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that TED has high overall performance in all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP with numerous turns.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful framework for enabling agents to learn complex, coordinated behaviors but faces persistent challenges regarding its generalization, scalability and sample efficiency. Recent advancements have sought to alleviate those issues by embedding intrinsic symmetries of the systems in the policy. Yet, most dynamical systems exhibit little to no symmetries to exploit. This paper presents a novel framework for embedding extrinsic symmetries in multi-agent system dynamics that enables the use of symmetry-enhanced methods to address systems with insufficient intrinsic symmetries, expanding the scope of equivariant learning to a wide variety of MARL problems. Central to our framework is the Group Equivariant Graphormer, a group-modular architecture specifically designed for distributed swarming tasks. Extensive experiments on a swarm of symmetry-breaking quadrotors validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential for improved generalization and zero-shot scalability. Our method achieves significant reductions in collision rates and enhances task success rates across a diverse range of scenarios and varying swarm sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonsuk Jang, Thierry Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their increasing size poses significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with fine-grained block-wise quantization emerging as a promising hardware-supported solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. To address this, we propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures hardware efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. BlockDialect achieves 11.40% (6.90%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with a comparable bit usage per data, while being only 5.89% (3.31%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vriksha Srihari, R. Bhavya, Shruti Jayaraman, V. Mary Anita Rajam</p>
<p>Abstract: While generative models such as text-to-image, large language models and text-to-video have seen significant progress, the extension to text-to-virtual-reality remains largely unexplored, due to a deficit in training data and the complexity of achieving realistic depth and motion in virtual environments. This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text.
  Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort.
  We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fr\'echet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method.
  Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Wang, Oleksii Ostras, Masashi Sode, Bahareh Tolooshams, Zongyi Li, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Gianmarco Pinton, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Lung ultrasound is a growing modality in clinics for diagnosing and monitoring acute and chronic lung diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. Lung ultrasound works by emitting diagnostic pulses, receiving pressure waves and converting them into radio frequency (RF) data, which are then processed into B-mode images with beamformers for radiologists to interpret. However, unlike conventional ultrasound for soft tissue anatomical imaging, lung ultrasound interpretation is complicated by complex reverberations from the pleural interface caused by the inability of ultrasound to penetrate air. The indirect B-mode images make interpretation highly dependent on reader expertise, requiring years of training, which limits its widespread use despite its potential for high accuracy in skilled hands.
  To address these challenges and democratize ultrasound lung imaging as a reliable diagnostic tool, we propose LUNA, an AI model that directly reconstructs lung aeration maps from RF data, bypassing the need for traditional beamformers and indirect interpretation of B-mode images. LUNA uses a Fourier neural operator, which processes RF data efficiently in Fourier space, enabling accurate reconstruction of lung aeration maps. LUNA offers a quantitative, reader-independent alternative to traditional semi-quantitative lung ultrasound scoring methods. The development of LUNA involves synthetic and real data: We simulate synthetic data with an experimentally validated approach and scan ex vivo swine lungs as real data. Trained on abundant simulated data and fine-tuned with a small amount of real-world data, LUNA achieves robust performance, demonstrated by an aeration estimation error of 9% in ex-vivo lung scans. We demonstrate the potential of reconstructing lung aeration maps from RF data, providing a foundation for improving lung ultrasound reproducibility and diagnostic utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongho Hong, Yong-Hoon Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation. Our code and audio samples are available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Mushtaq, Muhammad Rafay Naeem, Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Muhammad Imran Taj, Imran Hashmi, Junaid Qadir</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to harness collective intelligence in complex problem-solving, decision-making, and planning tasks. This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej Mihel\v{c}i\'c, Ivan Grubi\v{s}i\'c, Miha Keber</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models (DLMs) achieve increasingly high performance both on structured and unstructured data. They significantly extended applicability of machine learning to various domains. Their success in making predictions, detecting patterns and generating new data made significant impact on science and industry. Despite these accomplishments, DLMs are difficult to explain because of their enormous size. In this work, we propose a novel framework for post-hoc explaining and relating DLMs using redescriptions. The framework allows cohort analysis of arbitrary DLMs by identifying statistically significant redescriptions of neuron activations. It allows coupling neurons to a set of target labels or sets of descriptive attributes, relating layers within a single DLM or associating different DLMs. The proposed framework is independent of the artificial neural network architecture and can work with more complex target labels (e.g. multi-label or multi-target scenario). Additionally, it can emulate both pedagogical and decompositional approach to rule extraction. The aforementioned properties of the proposed framework can increase explainability and interpretability of arbitrary DLMs by providing different information compared to existing explainable-AI approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Consistency models have emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion models, offering high-quality generative capabilities through single-step sample generation. However, their application to multi-domain image translation tasks, such as cross-modal translation and low-light image enhancement remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Conditional Consistency Models (CCMs) for multi-domain image translation by incorporating additional conditional inputs. We implement these modifications by introducing task-specific conditional inputs that guide the denoising process, ensuring that the generated outputs retain structural and contextual information from the corresponding input domain. We evaluate CCMs on 10 different datasets demonstrating their effectiveness in producing high-quality translated images across multiple domains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammet Balcilar, Bharath Bhushan Damodaran, Karam Naser, Franck Galpin, Pierre Hellier</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end image and video codecs are becoming increasingly competitive, compared to traditional compression techniques that have been developed through decades of manual engineering efforts. These trainable codecs have many advantages over traditional techniques, such as their straightforward adaptation to perceptual distortion metrics and high performance in specific fields thanks to their learning ability. However, current state-of-the-art neural codecs do not fully exploit the benefits of vector quantization and the existence of the entropy gradient in decoding devices. In this paper, we propose to leverage these two properties (vector quantization and entropy gradient) to improve the performance of off-the-shelf codecs. Firstly, we demonstrate that using non-uniform scalar quantization cannot improve performance over uniform quantization. We thus suggest using predefined optimal uniform vector quantization to improve performance. Secondly, we show that the entropy gradient, available at the decoder, is correlated with the reconstruction error gradient, which is not available at the decoder. We therefore use the former as a proxy to enhance compression performance. Our experimental results show that these approaches save between 1 to 3% of the rate for the same quality across various pretrained methods. In addition, the entropy gradient based solution improves traditional codec performance significantly as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyao Wang, Xu Chen, Chengming Xu, Junwei Zhu, Xiaobin Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yuqi Liu, Yiyi Zhou, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Face Restoration (FR) is a crucial area within image and video processing, focusing on reconstructing high-quality portraits from degraded inputs. Despite advancements in image FR, video FR remains relatively under-explored, primarily due to challenges related to temporal consistency, motion artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality video data. Moreover, traditional face restoration typically prioritizes enhancing resolution and may not give as much consideration to related tasks such as facial colorization and inpainting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the Generalized Video Face Restoration (GVFR) task, which integrates video BFR, inpainting, and colorization tasks that we empirically show to benefit each other. We present a unified framework, termed as stable video face restoration (SVFR), which leverages the generative and motion priors of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and incorporates task-specific information through a unified face restoration framework. A learnable task embedding is introduced to enhance task identification. Meanwhile, a novel Unified Latent Regularization (ULR) is employed to encourage the shared feature representation learning among different subtasks. To further enhance the restoration quality and temporal stability, we introduce the facial prior learning and the self-referred refinement as auxiliary strategies used for both training and inference. The proposed framework effectively combines the complementary strengths of these tasks, enhancing temporal coherence and achieving superior restoration quality. This work advances the state-of-the-art in video FR and establishes a new paradigm for generalized video face restoration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Yang, Haibo Wan, Zhihai Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) change detection incurs a high cost because of false negatives, which are more costly than false positives. Existing frameworks, struggling to improve the Precision metric to reduce the cost of false positive, still have limitations in focusing on the change of interest, which leads to missed detections and discontinuity issues. This work tackles these issues by enhancing feature learning capabilities and integrating the frequency components of feature information, with a strategy to incrementally boost the Recall value. We propose an enhanced hybrid of CNN and Transformer network (EHCTNet) for effectively mining the change information of interest. Firstly, a dual branch feature extraction module is used to extract the multi scale features of RS images. Secondly, the frequency component of these features is exploited by a refined module I. Thirdly, an enhanced token mining module based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network is utilized to derive semantic information. Finally, the semantic change information's frequency component, beneficial for final detection, is mined from the refined module II. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EHCTNet in comprehending complex changes of interest. The visualization outcomes show that EHCTNet detects more intact and continuous changed areas and perceives more accurate neighboring distinction than state of the art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongle Huang, Haodong Chen, Zhenbang Xu, Zihan Jia, Haozhou Sun, Dian Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Human action understanding is crucial for the advancement of multimodal systems. While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models (LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they often overlook the need for more specific capabilities. In this work, we address the more challenging task of Fine-grained Action Recognition (FAR), which focuses on detailed semantic labels within shorter temporal duration (e.g., "salto backward tucked with 1 turn"). Given the high costs of annotating fine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we propose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR, incorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges. Specifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level temporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a new strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm through involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the high uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the Adaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that SeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and FineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other semi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, we show that the features extracted by our SeFAR could largely promote the ability of multimodal foundation models to understand fine-grained and domain-specific semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Weber, Moritz Huber, Maximilian Auch, Alexander D\"oschl, Max-Emanuel Keller, Peter Mandl</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, toxic content and hate speech have become widespread phenomena on the internet. Moderators of online newspapers and forums are now required, partly due to legal regulations, to carefully review and, if necessary, delete reader comments. This is a labor-intensive process. Some providers of large language models already offer solutions for automated hate speech detection or the identification of toxic content. These include GPT-4o from OpenAI, Jigsaw's (Google) Perspective API, and OpenAI's Moderation API. Based on the selected German test dataset HOCON34k, which was specifically created for developing tools to detect hate speech in reader comments of online newspapers, these solutions are compared with each other and against the HOCON34k baseline. The test dataset contains 1,592 annotated text samples. For GPT-4o, three different promptings are used, employing a Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot approach. The results of the experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms both the Perspective API and the Moderation API, and exceeds the HOCON34k baseline by approximately 5 percentage points, as measured by a combined metric of MCC and F2-score.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-Correction aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to self-verify and self-refine their initial responses without external feedback. However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roy Ravid</p>
<p>Abstract: Marketing mix modeling (MMM) is a widely used method to assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and optimize marketing strategies. Bayesian MMM is an advanced approach that allows for the incorporation of prior information, uncertainty quantification, and probabilistic predictions (1). In this paper, we describe the process of building a Bayesian MMM model for the online insurance company Lemonade. We first collected data on Lemonade's marketing activities, such as online advertising, social media, and brand marketing, as well as performance data. We then used a Bayesian framework to estimate the contribution of each marketing channel on total performance, while accounting for various factors such as seasonality, market trends, and macroeconomic indicators. To validate the model, we compared its predictions with the actual performance data from A/B-testing and sliding window holdout data (2). The results showed that the predicted contribution of each marketing channel is aligned with A/B test performance and is actionable. Furthermore, we conducted several scenario analyses using convex optimization to test the sensitivity of the model to different assumptions and to evaluate the impact of changes in the marketing mix on sales. The insights gained from the model allowed Lemonade to adjust their marketing strategy and allocate their budget more effectively. Our case study demonstrates the benefits of using Bayesian MMM for marketing attribution and optimization in a data-driven company like Lemonade. The approach is flexible, interpretable, and can provide valuable insights for decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Han Huang, Argyrios Gerogiannis, Subhonmesh Bose, Venugopal V. Veeravalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated methods for jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content. Typically, these methods are evaluated using datasets of malicious prompts designed to bypass security policies established by LLM providers. However, the generally broad scope and open-ended nature of existing datasets can complicate the assessment of jailbreaking effectiveness, particularly in specific domains, notably cybersecurity. To address this issue, we present and publicly release CySecBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 12662 prompts specifically designed to evaluate jailbreaking techniques in the cybersecurity domain. The dataset is organized into 10 distinct attack-type categories, featuring close-ended prompts to enable a more consistent and accurate assessment of jailbreaking attempts. Furthermore, we detail our methodology for dataset generation and filtration, which can be adapted to create similar datasets in other domains. To demonstrate the utility of CySecBench, we propose and evaluate a jailbreaking approach based on prompt obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this method successfully elicits harmful content from commercial black-box LLMs, achieving Success Rates (SRs) of 65% with ChatGPT and 88% with Gemini; in contrast, Claude demonstrated greater resilience with a jailbreaking SR of 17%. Compared to existing benchmark approaches, our method shows superior performance, highlighting the value of domain-specific evaluation datasets for assessing LLM security measures. Moreover, when evaluated using prompts from a widely used dataset (i.e., AdvBench), it achieved an SR of 78.5%, higher than the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective process monitoring is increasingly vital in industrial automation for ensuring operational safety, necessitating both high accuracy and efficiency. Although Transformers have demonstrated success in various fields, their canonical form based on the self-attention mechanism is inadequate for process monitoring due to two primary limitations: (1) the step-wise correlations captured by self-attention mechanism are difficult to capture discriminative patterns in monitoring logs due to the lacking semantics of each step, thus compromising accuracy; (2) the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention hampers efficiency. To address these issues, we propose DeepFilter, a Transformer-style framework for process monitoring. The core innovation is an efficient filtering layer that excel capturing long-term and periodic patterns with reduced complexity. Equipping with the global filtering layer, DeepFilter enhances both accuracy and efficiency, meeting the stringent demands of process monitoring. Experimental results on real-world process monitoring datasets validate DeepFilter's superiority in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Dennler, Stefanos Nikolaidis, Maja Matari\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: People have a variety of preferences for how robots behave. To understand and reason about these preferences, robots aim to learn a reward function that describes how aligned robot behaviors are with a user's preferences. Good representations of a robot's behavior can significantly reduce the time and effort required for a user to teach the robot their preferences. Specifying these representations -- what "features" of the robot's behavior matter to users -- remains a difficult problem; Features learned from raw data lack semantic meaning and features learned from user data require users to engage in tedious labeling processes. Our key insight is that users tasked with customizing a robot are intrinsically motivated to produce labels through exploratory search; they explore behaviors that they find interesting and ignore behaviors that are irrelevant. To harness this novel data source of exploratory actions, we propose contrastive learning from exploratory actions (CLEA) to learn trajectory features that are aligned with features that users care about. We learned CLEA features from exploratory actions users performed in an open-ended signal design activity (N=25) with a Kuri robot, and evaluated CLEA features through a second user study with a different set of users (N=42). CLEA features outperformed self-supervised features when eliciting user preferences over four metrics: completeness, simplicity, minimality, and explainability.</p>

Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Abnormal Localization Rewarding and Vision Relevance Rewarding. Experimental results demonstrate that our UMed-LVLM surpasses existing Med-LVLMs in identifying and understanding medical abnormality. In addition, this work shows that enhancing the abnormality detection capabilities of Med-LVLMs significantly improves their understanding of medical images and generalization capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Or Patashnik, Rinon Gal, Daniil Ostashev, Sergey Tulyakov, Kfir Aberman, Daniel Cohen-Or</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects across diverse scenes and styles is a rapidly advancing field. Current approaches often face challenges in maintaining a balance between identity preservation and alignment with the input text prompt. Some methods rely on a single textual token to represent a subject, which limits expressiveness, while others employ richer representations but disrupt the model's prior, diminishing prompt alignment. In this work, we introduce Nested Attention, a novel mechanism that injects a rich and expressive image representation into the model's existing cross-attention layers. Our key idea is to generate query-dependent subject values, derived from nested attention layers that learn to select relevant subject features for each region in the generated image. We integrate these nested layers into an encoder-based personalization method, and show that they enable high identity preservation while adhering to input text prompts. Our approach is general and can be trained on various domains. Additionally, its prior preservation allows us to combine multiple personalized subjects from different domains in a single image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghyun Lee, Yuqi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of generative AI, deep generative models (DGMs) with latent representations have gained tremendous popularity. Despite their impressive empirical performance, the statistical properties of these models remain underexplored. DGMs are often overparametrized, non-identifiable, and uninterpretable black boxes, raising serious concerns when deploying them in high-stakes applications. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretable deep generative modeling framework for rich data types with discrete latent layers, called Deep Discrete Encoders (DDEs). A DDE is a directed graphical model with multiple binary latent layers. Theoretically, we propose transparent identifiability conditions for DDEs, which imply progressively smaller sizes of the latent layers as they go deeper. Identifiability ensures consistent parameter estimation and inspires an interpretable design of the deep architecture. Computationally, we propose a scalable estimation pipeline of a layerwise nonlinear spectral initialization followed by a penalized stochastic approximation EM algorithm. This procedure can efficiently estimate models with exponentially many latent components. Extensive simulation studies validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the proposed algorithms' excellent performance. We apply DDEs to three diverse real datasets for hierarchical topic modeling, image representation learning, response time modeling in educational testing, and obtain interpretable findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshitomo Matsubara, Matteo Mendula, Marco Levorato</p>
<p>Abstract: Split computing ($\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep learning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak sensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers through channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on split computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods to multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase runtime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head supervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental results show that the multi-task supervised compression model either outperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of predictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets while learning compressed representations at its early layers. Furthermore, our models reduced end-to-end latency (by up to 95.4%) and energy consumption of mobile devices (by up to 88.2%) in multi-task split computing scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work aims to predict the popularity of short videos using the videos themselves and their related features. Popularity is measured by four key engagement metrics: view count, like count, comment count, and share count. This study employs video classification models with different architectures and training methods as backbone networks to extract video modality features. Meanwhile, the cleaned video captions are incorporated into a carefully designed prompt framework, along with the video, as input for video-to-text generation models, which generate detailed text-based video content understanding. These texts are then encoded into vectors using a pre-trained BERT model. Based on the six sets of vectors mentioned above, a neural network is trained for each of the four prediction metrics. Moreover, the study conducts data mining and feature engineering based on the video and tabular data, constructing practical features such as the total frequency of hashtag appearances, the total frequency of mention appearances, video duration, frame count, frame rate, and total time online. Multiple machine learning models are trained, and the most stable model, XGBoost, is selected. Finally, the predictions from the neural network and XGBoost models are averaged to obtain the final result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingfeng Yao, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating high-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces. To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64 epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the original DiT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihoon Chung, Tyler Zhu, Max Gonzalez Saez-Diez, Juan Carlos Niebles, Honglu Zhou, Olga Russakovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinshun Liu, Yizhi Fang, Yichao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a new perspective on the structure of Neural Networks (NNs). Traditional Neural Networks are typically tree-like structures for convenience, which can be predefined or learned by NAS methods. However, such a structure can not facilitate communications between nodes at the same level or signal transmissions to previous levels. These defects prevent effective collaboration, restricting the capabilities of neural networks. It is well-acknowledged that the biological neural system contains billions of neural units. Their connections are far more complicated than the current NN structure. To enhance the representational ability of neural networks, existing works try to increase the depth of the neural network and introduce more parameters. However, they all have limitations with constrained parameters. In this work, we introduce a synchronous graph-based structure to establish a novel way of organizing the neural units: the Neural Modules. This framework allows any nodes to communicate with each other and encourages neural units to work collectively, demonstrating a departure from the conventional constrained paradigm. Such a structure also provides more candidates for the NAS methods. Furthermore, we also propose an elegant regularization method to organize neural units into multiple independent, balanced neural modules systematically. This would be convenient for handling these neural modules in parallel. Compared to traditional NNs, our method unlocks the potential of NNs from tree-like structures to general graphs and makes NNs be optimized in an almost complete set. Our approach proves adaptable to diverse tasks, offering compatibility across various scenarios. Quantitative experimental results substantiate the potential of our structure, indicating the improvement of NNs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This survey gives an overview of Monte Carlo methodologies using surrogate models, for dealing with densities which are intractable, costly, and/or noisy. This type of problem can be found in numerous real-world scenarios, including stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning, where each evaluation of a density function may incur some computationally-expensive or even physical (real-world activity) cost, likely to give different results each time. The surrogate model does not incur this cost, but there are important trade-offs and considerations involved in the choice and design of such methodologies. We classify the different methodologies into three main classes and describe specific instances of algorithms under a unified notation. A modular scheme which encompasses the considered methods is also presented. A range of application scenarios is discussed, with special attention to the likelihood-free setting and reinforcement learning. Several numerical comparisons are also provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Besbes, Will Ma, Omar Mouchtaki</p>
<p>Abstract: How should one leverage historical data when past observations are not perfectly indicative of the future, e.g., due to the presence of unobserved confounders which one cannot "correct" for? Motivated by this question, we study a data-driven decision-making framework in which historical samples are generated from unknown and different distributions assumed to lie in a heterogeneity ball with known radius and centered around the (also) unknown future (out-of-sample) distribution on which the performance of a decision will be evaluated. This work aims at analyzing the performance of central data-driven policies but also near-optimal ones in these heterogeneous environments and understanding key drivers of performance. We establish a first result which allows to upper bound the asymptotic worst-case regret of a broad class of policies. Leveraging this result, for any integral probability metric, we provide a general analysis of the performance achieved by Sample Average Approximation (SAA) as a function of the radius of the heterogeneity ball. This analysis is centered around the approximation parameter, a notion of complexity we introduce to capture how the interplay between the heterogeneity and the problem structure impacts the performance of SAA. In turn, we illustrate through several widely-studied problems -- e.g., newsvendor, pricing -- how this methodology can be applied and find that the performance of SAA varies considerably depending on the combinations of problem classes and heterogeneity. The failure of SAA for certain instances motivates the design of alternative policies to achieve rate-optimality. We derive problem-dependent policies achieving strong guarantees for the illustrative problems described above and provide initial results towards a principled approach for the design and analysis of general rate-optimal algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Tang, Junlin He, Zhan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Human mobility prediction is a fundamental task essential for various applications in urban planning, location-based services and intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods often ignore activity information crucial for reasoning human preferences and routines, or adopt a simplified representation of the dependencies between time, activities and locations. To address these issues, we present Hierarchical Graph Attention Recurrent Network (HGARN) for human mobility prediction. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical graph based on past mobility records and employ a Hierarchical Graph Attention Module to capture complex time-activity-location dependencies. This way, HGARN can learn representations with rich human travel semantics to model user preferences at the global level. We also propose a model-agnostic history-enhanced confidence (MAHEC) label to incorporate each user's individual-level preferences. Finally, we introduce a Temporal Module, which employs recurrent structures to jointly predict users' next activities and their associated locations, with the former used as an auxiliary task to enhance the latter prediction. For model evaluation, we test the performance of HGARN against existing state-of-the-art methods in both the recurring (i.e., returning to a previously visited location) and explorative (i.e., visiting a new location) settings. Overall, HGARN outperforms other baselines significantly in all settings based on two real-world human mobility data benchmarks. These findings confirm the important role that human activities play in determining mobility decisions, illustrating the need to develop activity-aware intelligent transportation systems.

<p>Abstract: We study the classical Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem with accept/reject decisions and $T$ IID arrivals. We consider a distributional form where each arrival must fall under a finite number of possible categories, each with a deterministic resource consumption vector, but a random value distributed continuously over an interval. We develop an online algorithm that achieves $O(\log^2 T)$ regret under this model, with the only (necessary) assumption being that the probability densities are bounded away from 0. We derive a second result that achieves $O(\log T)$ regret under an additional assumption of second-order growth. To our knowledge, these are the first results achieving logarithmic-level regret in an NRM model with continuous values that do not require any kind of "non-degeneracy" assumptions. Our results are achieved via new techniques including a new method of bounding myopic regret, a "semi-fluid" relaxation of the offline allocation, and an improved bound on the "dual convergence".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Capstick, Francesca Palermo, Tianyu Cui, Payam Barnaghi</p>
<p>Abstract: When data is generated by multiple sources, conventional training methods update models assuming equal reliability for each source and do not consider their individual data quality. However, in many applications, sources have varied levels of reliability that can have negative effects on the performance of a neural network. A key issue is that often the quality of the data for individual sources is not known during training. Previous methods for training models in the presence of noisy data do not make use of the additional information that the source label can provide. Focusing on supervised learning, we aim to train neural networks on each data source for a number of steps proportional to the source's estimated reliability by using a dynamic re-weighting strategy motivated by likelihood tempering. This way, we allow training on all sources during the warm-up and reduce learning on less reliable sources during the final training stages, when it has been shown that models overfit to noise. We show through diverse experiments that this can significantly improve model performance when trained on mixtures of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain performance when models are trained on reliable sources only.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Alex O. Vasilescu</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates forward and inverse causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of the operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in a doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Liang, Xiaojie Mao, Shiyuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study an online joint assortment-inventory optimization problem, in which we assume that the choice behavior of each customer follows the Multinomial Logit (MNL) choice model, and the attraction parameters are unknown a priori. The retailer makes periodic assortment and inventory decisions to dynamically learn from the customer choice observations about the attraction parameters while maximizing the expected total profit over time. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can effectively balance exploration and exploitation in the online decision-making of assortment and inventory. Our algorithm builds on a new estimator for the MNL attraction parameters, an innovative approach to incentivize exploration by adaptively tuning certain known and unknown parameters, and an optimization oracle to static single-cycle assortment-inventory planning problems with given parameters. We establish a regret upper bound for our algorithm and a lower bound for the online joint assortment-inventory optimization problem, suggesting that our algorithm achieves nearly optimal regret rate, provided that the static optimization oracle is exact. Then we incorporate more practical approximate static optimization oracles into our algorithm, and bound from above the impact of static optimization errors on the regret of our algorithm. We perform numerical studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. At last, we extend our study by incorporating inventory carryover and the learning of customer arrival distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Ye, Weihao Yan, Christoph Brune, Mengwu Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression is widely applied in computational science and engineering for surrogate modeling owning to its kernel-based and probabilistic nature. In this work, we propose a Bayesian approach that integrates the variability of input data into the Gaussian process regression for function and partial differential equation approximation. Leveraging two types of observables -- noise-corrupted outputs with certain inputs and those with prior-distribution-defined uncertain inputs, a posterior distribution of uncertain inputs is estimated via Bayesian inference. Thereafter, such quantified uncertainties of inputs are incorporated into Gaussian process predictions by means of marginalization. The setting of two types of data aligned with common scenarios of constructing surrogate models for the solutions of partial differential equations, where the data of boundary conditions and initial conditions are typically known while the data of solution may involve uncertainties due to the measurement or stochasticity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through several numerical examples including multiple one-dimensional functions, the heat equation and Allen-Cahn equation. A consistently good performance of generalization is observed, and a substantial reduction in the predictive uncertainties is achieved by the Bayesian inference of uncertain inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Shtoff, Elie Abboud, Rotem Stram, Oren Somekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Factorization machine (FM) variants are widely used for large scale real-time content recommendation systems, since they offer an excellent balance between model accuracy and low computational costs for training and inference. These systems are trained on tabular data with both numerical and categorical columns. Incorporating numerical columns poses a challenge, and they are typically incorporated using a scalar transformation or binning, which can be either learned or chosen a-priori. In this work, we provide a systematic and theoretically-justified way to incorporate numerical features into FM variants by encoding them into a vector of function values for a set of functions of one's choice.
  We view factorization machines as approximators of segmentized functions, namely, functions from a field's value to the real numbers, assuming the remaining fields are assigned some given constants, which we refer to as the segment. From this perspective, we show that our technique yields a model that learns segmentized functions of the numerical feature spanned by the set of functions of one's choice, namely, the spanning coefficients vary between segments. Hence, to improve model accuracy we advocate the use of functions known to have strong approximation power, and offer the B-Spline basis due to its well-known approximation power, availability in software libraries, and efficiency. Our technique preserves fast training and inference, and requires only a small modification of the computational graph of an FM model. Therefore, it is easy to incorporate into an existing system to improve its performance. Finally, we back our claims with a set of experiments, including synthetic, performance evaluation on several data-sets, and an A/B test on a real online advertising system which shows improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yassir Jedra, Sean Mann, Charlotte Park, Devavrat Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a variant of matrix completion where entries are revealed in a biased manner. We wish to understand the extent to which such bias can be exploited in improving predictions. Towards that, we propose a natural model where the observation pattern and outcome of interest are driven by the same set of underlying latent (or unobserved) factors. We devise Mask Nearest Neighbor (MNN), a novel two-stage matrix completion algorithm: first, it recovers (distances between) the latent factors by utilizing matrix estimation for the fully observed noisy binary matrix, corresponding to the observation pattern; second, it utilizes the recovered latent factors as features and sparsely observed noisy outcomes as labels to perform non-parametric supervised learning. Our analysis reveals that MNN enjoys entry-wise finite-sample error rates that are competitive with corresponding supervised learning parametric rates. Despite not having access to the latent factors and dealing with biased observations, MNN exhibits such competitive performance via only exploiting the shared information between the bias and outcomes. Finally, through empirical evaluation using a real-world dataset, we find that with MNN, the estimates have 28x smaller mean squared error compared to traditional matrix completion methods, suggesting the utility of the model and method proposed in this work.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study a ranking and selection problem of learning from choice-based feedback with dynamic assortments. In this problem, a company sequentially displays a set of items to a population of customers and collects their choices as feedback. The only information available about the underlying choice model is that the choice probabilities are consistent with some unknown true strict ranking over the items. The objective is to identify, with the fewest samples, the most preferred item or the full ranking over the items at a high confidence level. We present novel and simple algorithms for both learning goals. In the first subproblem regarding best-item identification, we introduce an elimination-based algorithm, Nested Elimination (NE). In the more complex subproblem regarding full-ranking identification, we generalize NE and propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm, Nested Partition (NP). We provide strong characterizations of both algorithms through instance-specific and non-asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity. This is accomplished using an analytical framework that characterizes the system dynamics through analyzing a sequence of multi-dimensional random walks. We also establish a connection between our nested approach and the information-theoretic lower bounds. We thus show that NE is worst-case asymptotically optimal, and NP is optimal up to a constant factor. Finally, numerical experiments from both synthetic and real data corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15398">The Initial Screening Order Problem</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose M. Alvarez, Antonio Mastropietro, Salvatore Ruggieri</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the role of the initial screening order (ISO) in candidate screening. The ISO refers to the order in which the screener searches the candidate pool when selecting $k$ candidates. Today, it is common for the ISO to be the product of an information access system, such as an online platform or a database query. The ISO has been largely overlooked in the literature, despite its impact on the optimality and fairness of the selected $k$ candidates, especially under a human screener. We define two problem formulations describing the search behavior of the screener given an ISO: the best-$k$, where it selects the top $k$ candidates; and the good-$k$, where it selects the first good-enough $k$ candidates. To study the impact of the ISO, we introduce a human-like screener and compare it to its algorithmic counterpart, where the human-like screener is conceived to be inconsistent over time. Our analysis, in particular, shows that the ISO, under a human-like screener solving for the good-$k$ problem, hinders individual fairness despite meeting group fairness, and hampers the optimality of the selected $k$ candidates. This is due to position bias, where a candidate's evaluation is affected by its position within the ISO. We report extensive simulated experiments exploring the parameters of the best-$k$ and good-$k$ problems for both screeners. Our simulation framework is flexible enough to account for multiple candidate screening tasks, being an alternative to running real-world procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanming Zhang, Xiaoxue Wang, Yonghang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a general analytical framework using DBSCAN clustering and penalized regression models to address multifactor problems with structural complexity and multicollinearity issues, such as carbon emission issue. The framework leverages DBSCAN for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features. Meanwhile, penalized regression considers model complexity control and high dimensional feature selection to identify dominant influencing factors. Applying this framework to analyze energy consumption data for 46 industries from 2000 to 2019 identified 16 categories in the sample of China. We quantitatively assessed emission characteristics and drivers for each. The results demonstrate the framework's analytical approach can identify primary emission sources by category, providing quantitative references for decision-making. Overall, this framework can evaluate complex regional issues like carbon emissions to support policymaking. This research preliminarily validated its application value in identifying opportunities for emission reduction worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Chen, Xinyu Yang, Keqing Du, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The cross-pollination between causal discovery and deep learning has led to increasingly extensive interactions. It results in a large number of deep learning data types (such as images, text, etc.) extending into the field of causal discovery, and a multitude of deep learning tasks have begun to utilize causal discovery to explore the internal causal structure and causal representation of data. In this paper, we first identified that a complex data type, ``Indefinite Data", has conflicts between causal relationships expressed by the causal structure and causal representation generated by deep learning models, a phenomenon referred to as causal inconsistency. We thoroughly analyzed related work to explain why only Indefinite Data exhibits causal inconsistency while other data types do not. Furthermore, to alleviate causal inconsistency, we proposed a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework based on intervention, hoping to provide more causal information from different intervention views to promote consistency between structure and representation. Extensive experiments have shown that the SSL framework enhances causal consistency and can further improve causal structure and representation learning performance. Additionally, we extended the SSL framework to three different downstream tasks and LLM instructions. The quantitative results of these applications all reflect the performance improvement brought about by causal consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Furuta, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Izzeddin Gur</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model agents (LMA) recently emerged as a promising paradigm on muti-step decision making tasks, often outperforming humans and other reinforcement learning agents. Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4% to 54.8%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for task compositionality, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qilong Yan, Yufeng Zhang, Jinghao Zhang, Jingpu Duan, Jian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advancements in node classification, but their success relies on sufficient labeled nodes per class in the training data. Real-world graph data often exhibits a long-tail distribution with sparse labels, emphasizing the importance of GNNs' ability in few-shot node classification, which entails categorizing nodes with limited data. Traditional episodic meta-learning approaches have shown promise in this domain, but they face an inherent limitation: it might lead the model to converge to suboptimal solutions because of random and uniform task assignment, ignoring task difficulty levels. This could lead the meta-learner to face complex tasks too soon, hindering proper learning. Ideally, the meta-learner should start with simple concepts and advance to more complex ones, like human learning. So, we introduce CPT, a novel two-stage curriculum learning method that aligns task difficulty with the meta-learner's progressive competence, enhancing overall performance. Specifically, in CPT's initial stage, the focus is on simpler tasks, fostering foundational skills for engaging with complex tasks later. Importantly, the second stage dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on the meta-learner's growing competence, aiming for optimal knowledge acquisition. Extensive experiments on popular node classification datasets demonstrate significant improvements of our strategy over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Goodfriend</p>
<p>Abstract: Scripted agents have predominantly won the five previous iterations of the IEEE microRTS ($\mu$RTS) competitions hosted at CIG and CoG. Despite Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms making significant strides in real-time strategy (RTS) games, their adoption in this primarily academic competition has been limited due to the considerable training resources required and the complexity inherent in creating and debugging such agents. RAISocketAI is the first DRL agent to win the IEEE microRTS competition. In a benchmark without performance constraints, RAISocketAI regularly defeated the two prior competition winners. This first competition-winning DRL submission can be a benchmark for future microRTS competitions and a starting point for future DRL research. Iteratively fine-tuning the base policy and transfer learning to specific maps were critical to RAISocketAI's winning performance. These strategies can be used to economically train future DRL agents. Further work in Imitation Learning using Behavior Cloning and fine-tuning these models with DRL has proven promising as an efficient way to bootstrap models with demonstrated, competitive behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Ma, Haoyu Han, Juanhui Li, Harry Shomer, Hui Liu, Xiaofeng Gao, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction, which aims to forecast unseen connections in graphs, is a fundamental task in graph machine learning. Heuristic methods, leveraging a range of different pairwise measures such as common neighbors and shortest paths, often rival the performance of vanilla Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Therefore, recent advancements in GNNs for link prediction (GNN4LP) have primarily focused on integrating one or a few types of pairwise information. In this work, we reveal that different node pairs within the same dataset necessitate varied pairwise information for accurate prediction and models that only apply the same pairwise information uniformly could achieve suboptimal performance. As a result, we propose a simple mixture of experts model Link-MoE for link prediction. Link-MoE utilizes various GNNs as experts and strategically selects the appropriate expert for each node pair based on various types of pairwise information. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement from Link-MoE. Notably, Link-MoE achieves a relative improvement of 18.71\% on the MRR metric for the Pubmed dataset and 9.59\% on the Hits@100 metric for the ogbl-ppa dataset, compared to the best baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also \textit{generate high-performing neural network parameters}. Our approach is simple, utilizing an autoencoder and a diffusion model. The autoencoder extracts latent representations of a subset of the trained neural network parameters. Next, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize these latent representations from random noise. This model then generates new representations, which are passed through the autoencoder's decoder to produce new subsets of high-performing network parameters. Across various architectures and datasets, our approach consistently generates models with comparable or improved performance over trained networks, with minimal additional cost. Notably, we empirically find that the generated models are not memorizing the trained ones. Our results encourage more exploration into the versatile use of diffusion models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabera Talukder, Yisong Yue, Georgia Gkioxari</p>
<p>Abstract: This work studies the problem of time series analysis with generalist (or foundation) models, which are models trained across many data domains. Drawing inspiration from the widespread success of large language models, we consider the simple strategy of discretely tokenizing time series data drawn from a myriad of datasets via self-supervision, then using the fixed tokenization to solve a variety of tasks across many data domains. Canonically, time series models are either trained on a single dataset or built in a task-specific manner (e.g., a forecasting-only model), where many use patches of time as inputs to the model. As such, performant generalist, discrete representation time series models explored across many tasks are of value. Our method, TOkenized Time Series EMbeddings (TOTEM), produces such generalist time series models with minimal or no fine-tuning while exhibiting strong zero-shot performance. We evaluate TOTEM extensively over nearly 500 experiments on three commonly-studied time series tasks with real-world data: imputation (17 baselines, 12 datasets), anomaly detection (19 baselines, 25 datasets), and forecasting (14 baselines, 12 datasets). We conclude that TOTEM matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both the canonical specialist setting (i.e., training one model on one domain) as well as the generalist setting (i.e., training a single model on many domains), which demonstrates the efficacy of tokenization for general time series analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyan Hou, Shan Liu, Ya Zhang, Haotong Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in traffic demand prediction, and transportation modes can be divided into station-based mode and free-floating traffic mode. Existing research in traffic graph construction primarily relies on map matching to construct graphs based on the road network. However, the complexity and inhomogeneity of data distribution in free-floating traffic demand forecasting make road network matching inflexible. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel graph construction method tailored to free-floating traffic mode. We propose a novel density-based clustering algorithm (HDPC-L) to determine the flexible positioning of nodes in the graph, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of traditional clustering algorithms and enabling effective handling of large-scale datasets. Furthermore, we extract valuable information from ridership data to initialize the edge weights of GNNs. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets, the Shenzhen bike-sharing dataset and the Haikou ride-hailing dataset, show that the method significantly improves the performance of the model. On average, our models show an improvement in accuracy of around 25\% and 19.5\% on the two datasets. Additionally, it significantly enhances computational efficiency, reducing training time by approximately 12% and 32.5% on the two datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangamesh Kodge, Deepak Ravikumar, Gobinda Saha, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Label corruption, where training samples are mislabeled due to non-expert annotation or adversarial attacks, significantly degrades model performance. Acquiring large, perfectly labeled datasets is costly, and retraining models from scratch is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Scaled Activation Projection (SAP), a novel SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)-based corrective machine unlearning algorithm. SAP mitigates label noise by identifying a small subset of trusted samples using cross-entropy loss and projecting model weights onto a clean activation space estimated using SVD on these trusted samples. This process suppresses the noise introduced in activations due to the mislabeled samples. In our experiments, we demonstrate SAP's effectiveness on synthetic noise with different settings and real-world label noise. SAP applied to the CIFAR dataset with 25% synthetic corruption show upto 6% generalization improvements. Additionally, SAP can improve the generalization over noise robust training approaches on CIFAR dataset by ~3.2% on average. Further, we observe generalization improvements of 2.31% for a Vision Transformer model trained on naturally corrupted Clothing1M.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josiah Bjorgaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal data fusion is essential for applications requiring the integration of diverse data sources, especially in the presence of incomplete or sparsely available modalities. This paper presents a comparative study of three multimodal embedding techniques, Modal Channel Attention (MCA), Zorro, and Everything at Once (EAO), to evaluate their performance on sparsely multimodal data. MCA introduces fusion embeddings for all combinations of input modalities and uses attention masking to create distinct attention channels, enabling flexible and efficient data fusion. Experiments on two datasets with four modalities each, CMU-MOSEI and TCGA, demonstrate that MCA outperforms Zorro across ranking, recall, regression, and classification tasks and outperforms EAO across regression and classification tasks. MCA achieves superior performance by maintaining robust uniformity across unimodal and fusion embeddings. While EAO performs best in ranking metrics due to its approach of forming fusion embeddings post-inference, it underperforms in downstream tasks requiring multimodal interactions. These results highlight the importance of contrasting all modality combinations in constructing embedding spaces and offers insights into the design of multimodal architectures for real-world applications with incomplete data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cedric Doni\'e, Marie K. Reumann, Tony Hartung, Benedikt J. Braun, Tina Histing, Satoshi Endo, Sandra Hirche</p>
<p>Abstract: Bone non-union is among the most severe complications associated with trauma surgery, occurring in 10-30% of cases after long bone fractures. Treating non-unions requires a high level of surgical expertise and often involves multiple revision surgeries, sometimes even leading to amputation. Thus, more accurate prognosis is crucial for patient well-being. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) hold promise for developing models to predict non-union healing, even when working with smaller datasets, a commonly encountered challenge in clinical domains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in identifying candidates at risk of failed non-union healing, we applied three ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and XGBoost) to the clinical dataset TRUFFLE, which includes 797 patients with long bone non-union. The models provided prediction results with 70% sensitivity, and the specificities of 66% (XGBoost), 49% (support vector machine), and 43% (logistic regression). These findings offer valuable clinical insights because they enable early identification of patients at risk of failed non-union healing after the initial surgical revision treatment protocol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Shi, Rujie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data generation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality generative modelling method based on high-order Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching. This motive is proved by third-order Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the previous SDEs, e.g. variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously model position, velocity, and acceleration, thereby improving the quality and speed of the data generation at the same time. HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and two Hamiltonians, which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude. Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood, and achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daphne Theodorakopoulos, Frederic Stahl, Marius Lindauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization plays a pivotal role in enhancing the predictive performance and generalization capabilities of ML models. However, in many applications, we do not only care about predictive performance but also about additional objectives such as inference time, memory, or energy consumption. In such multi-objective scenarios, determining the importance of hyperparameters poses a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between the conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose the first method for assessing the importance of hyperparameters in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization. Our approach leverages surrogate-based hyperparameter importance measures, i.e., fANOVA and ablation paths, to provide insights into the impact of hyperparameters on the optimization objectives. Specifically, we compute the a-priori scalarization of the objectives and determine the importance of the hyperparameters for different objective tradeoffs. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets with three different objective pairs, each combined with accuracy, namely time, demographic parity loss, and energy consumption, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Our findings not only offer valuable guidance for hyperparameter tuning in multi-objective optimization tasks but also contribute to advancing the understanding of hyperparameter importance in complex optimization scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yuling Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanming Yang, Antonio Khalil Moretti, Sebastian Macaluso, Philippe Chlenski, Christian A. Naesseth, Itsik Pe'er</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing jets, which provide vital insights into the properties and histories of subatomic particles produced in high-energy collisions, is a main problem in data analyses in collider physics. This intricate task deals with estimating the latent structure of a jet (binary tree) and involves parameters such as particle energy, momentum, and types. While Bayesian methods offer a natural approach for handling uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge, they face significant challenges due to the super-exponential growth of potential jet topologies as the number of observed particles increases. To address this, we introduce a Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo approach for inferring jet latent structures. As a second contribution, we leverage the resulting estimator to develop a variational inference algorithm for parameter learning. Building on this, we introduce a variational family using a pseudo-marginal framework for a fully Bayesian treatment of all variables, unifying the generative model with the inference process. We illustrate our method's effectiveness through experiments using data generated with a collider physics generative model, highlighting superior speed and accuracy across a range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiye Zhou, Shucheng Wang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the training of large language models, parameter-efficient techniques such as LoRA optimize memory usage and reduce communication overhead and memory usage during the fine-tuning phase. However, applying such techniques directly during the pre-training phase results in poor performance, primarily because the premature implementation of low-rank training significantly reduces model accuracy. Existing methods like ReLoRA and GaLore have attempted to address this challenge by updating the low-rank subspace. However, they still fall short of achieving the accuracy of full-rank training. Specifically, ReLoRA restricts the frequency of updates to preserve optimizer states consistency, hindering its ability to closely approximate full-rank training behavior. Meanwhile, GaLore relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to approximate the full-rank space, which introduces accuracy loss during the approximation process. In this paper, we introduce SwitchLoRA, a parameter-efficient training technique that frequently and smoothly replaces the trainable parameters of LoRA adapters with alternative parameters. SwitchLoRA updates the low-rank subspace incrementally, targeting only a few dimensions at a time to minimize the impact on optimizer states. This allows a higher update frequency, thereby enhancing accuracy by enabling the updated parameters to more closely mimic full-rank behavior during the pre-training phase. Our results demonstrate that SwitchLoRA actually surpasses full-rank training, reducing perplexity from 15.23 to 15.01 on the LLaMA 1.3B model, while also cutting communication overhead by 54\% and memory usage by 13\%. Furthermore, after full fine-tuning the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model and the full-rank pre-trained model on the GLUE benchmark, the SwitchLoRA pre-trained model showed an average accuracy gain of about 1\% over the full-rank pre-trained model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utsav Singh, Souradip Chakraborty, Wesley A. Suttle, Brian M. Sadler, Vinay P Namboodiri, Amrit Singh Bedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning control policies to perform complex robotics tasks from human preference data presents significant challenges. On the one hand, the complexity of such tasks typically requires learning policies to perform a variety of subtasks, then combining them to achieve the overall goal. At the same time, comprehensive, well-engineered reward functions are typically unavailable in such problems, while limited human preference data often is; making efficient use of such data to guide learning is therefore essential. Methods for learning to perform complex robotics tasks from human preference data must overcome both these challenges simultaneously. In this work, we introduce DIPPER: Direct Preference Optimization to Accelerate Primitive-Enabled Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, an efficient hierarchical approach that leverages direct preference optimization to learn a higher-level policy and reinforcement learning to learn a lower-level policy. DIPPER enjoys improved computational efficiency due to its use of direct preference optimization instead of standard preference-based approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, while it also mitigates the well-known hierarchical reinforcement learning issues of non-stationarity and infeasible subgoal generation due to our use of primitive-informed regularization inspired by a novel bi-level optimization formulation of the hierarchical reinforcement learning problem. To validate our approach, we perform extensive experimental analysis on a variety of challenging robotics tasks, demonstrating that DIPPER outperforms hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, while ameliorating the non-stationarity and infeasible subgoal generation issues of hierarchical reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han-Jia Ye, Si-Yang Liu, Hao-Run Cai, Qi-Le Zhou, De-Chuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data is prevalent across diverse domains in machine learning. While classical methods like tree-based models have long been effective, Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based methods have recently demonstrated promising performance. However, the diverse characteristics of methods and the inherent heterogeneity of tabular datasets make understanding and interpreting tabular methods both challenging and prone to unstable observations. In this paper, we conduct in-depth evaluations and comprehensive analyses of tabular methods, with a particular focus on DNN-based models, using a benchmark of over 300 tabular datasets spanning a wide range of task types, sizes, and domains. First, we perform an extensive comparison of 32 state-of-the-art deep and tree-based methods, evaluating their average performance across multiple criteria. Although method ranks vary across datasets, we empirically find that top-performing methods tend to concentrate within a small subset of tabular models, regardless of the criteria used. Next, we investigate whether the training dynamics of deep tabular models can be predicted based on dataset properties. This approach not only offers insights into the behavior of deep tabular methods but also identifies a core set of "meta-features" that reflect dataset heterogeneity. The other subset includes datasets where method ranks are consistent with the overall benchmark, acting as a reliable probe for further tabular analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanzeng Xia, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue, Tongxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm for solving reinforcement learning problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context decision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine well-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM, GPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve surprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglei Shen, Xiao Zhang, Teng Shi, Changshuo Zhang, Guofu Xie, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controllability has become a crucial aspect of trustworthy machine learning, enabling learners to meet predefined targets and adapt dynamically at test time without requiring retraining as the targets shift. We provide a formal definition of controllable learning (CL), and discuss its applications in information retrieval (IR) where information needs are often complex and dynamic. The survey categorizes CL according to what is controllable (e.g., multiple objectives, user portrait, scenario adaptation), who controls (users or platforms), how control is implemented (e.g., rule-based method, Pareto optimization, hypernetwork and others), and where to implement control (e.g., pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing methods). Then, we identify challenges faced by CL across training, evaluation, task setting, and deployment in online environments. Additionally, we outline promising directions for CL in theoretical analysis, efficient computation, empowering large language models, application scenarios and evaluation frameworks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08843">Inflationary Flows: Calibrated Bayesian Inference with Diffusion-Based Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela de Albuquerque, John Pearson</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, inflationary flows, that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Luo, Zhixin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Conformal Thresholded Intervals (CTI), a novel conformal regression method that aims to produce the smallest possible prediction set with guaranteed coverage. Unlike existing methods that rely on nested conformal frameworks and full conditional distribution estimation, CTI estimates the conditional probability density for a new response to fall into each interquantile interval using off-the-shelf multi-output quantile regression. By leveraging the inverse relationship between interval length and probability density, CTI constructs prediction sets by thresholding the estimated conditional interquantile intervals based on their length. The optimal threshold is determined using a calibration set to ensure marginal coverage, effectively balancing the trade-off between prediction set size and coverage. CTI's approach is computationally efficient and avoids the complexity of estimating the full conditional distribution. The method is theoretically grounded, with provable guarantees for marginal coverage and achieving the smallest prediction size given by Neyman-Pearson . Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CTI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art conformal regression methods across various datasets, consistently producing smaller prediction sets while maintaining the desired coverage level. The proposed method offers a simple yet effective solution for reliable uncertainty quantification in regression tasks, making it an attractive choice for practitioners seeking accurate and efficient conformal prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bradley Brown, Jordan Juravsky, Ryan Ehrlich, Ronald Clark, Quoc V. Le, Christopher R\'e, Azalia Mirhoseini</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often limit models to making only one attempt at a problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling, using the simple technique of repeatedly sampling candidate solutions from a model. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage -- the fraction of problems that are solved by any generated sample -- scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-sample state-of-the-art of 43%. In domains without automatic verifiers, we find that common methods for picking from a sample collection (majority voting and reward models) plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arseniy Shumilov, Yueting Zhu, Negin Ashrafi, Armin Abdollahi, Greg Placencia, Kamiar Alaei, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis is a severe condition responsible for many deaths in the United States and worldwide, making accurate prediction of outcomes crucial for timely and effective treatment. Previous studies employing machine learning faced limitations in feature selection and model interpretability, reducing their clinical applicability. This research aimed to develop an interpretable and accurate machine learning model to predict in-hospital sepsis mortality, addressing these gaps. Using ICU patient records from the MIMIC-III database, we extracted relevant data through a combination of literature review, clinical input refinement, and Random Forest-based feature selection, identifying the top 35 features. Data preprocessing included cleaning, imputation, standardization, and applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, resulting in a dataset of 4,683 patients with 17,429 admissions. Five models-Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor-were developed and evaluated. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.90, AUROC of 0.97, precision of 0.93, recall of 0.91, and F1-score of 0.92. These findings underscore the potential of data-driven machine learning approaches to improve critical care, offering clinicians a powerful tool for predicting in-hospital sepsis mortality and enhancing patient outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotang Wang, Yun Zhu, Haizhou Shi, Yongchao Liu, Chuntao Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently achieved significant success in the graph domain by effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and graph inductive biases. However, these methods face two primary challenges: (1) multi-view chaos, which results from coupling multi-view information (positional, structural, attribute), thereby impeding flexible usage and the interpretability of the propagation process. (2) local-global chaos, which arises from coupling local message passing with global attention, leading to issues of overfitting and over-globalizing. To address these challenges, we propose a high-level decoupled perspective of GTs, breaking them down into three components and two interaction levels: positional attention, structural attention, and attribute attention, alongside local and global interaction. Based on this decoupled perspective, we design a decoupled graph triple attention network named DeGTA, which separately computes multi-view attentions and adaptively integrates multi-view local and global information. This approach offers three key advantages: enhanced interpretability, flexible design, and adaptive integration of local and global information. Through extensive experiments, DeGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets and tasks, including node classification and graph classification. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that decoupling is essential for improving performance and enhancing interpretability.

While conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with valid coverage guarantees, it traditionally focuses on single predictions. This paper introduces novel conformal prediction methods for estimating the sum or average of unknown labels over specific index sets. We develop conformal prediction intervals for single target to the prediction interval for sum of multiple targets. Under permutation invariant assumptions, we prove the validity of our proposed method. We also apply our algorithms on class average estimation and path cost prediction tasks, and we show that our method outperforms existing conformalized approaches as well as non-conformal approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous for modeling complex relationships between objects across various fields. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a mainstream technique for graph-based applications, but their performance heavily relies on abundant labeled data. To reduce labeling requirement, pre-training and prompt learning has become a popular alternative. However, most existing prompt methods do not differentiate homophilic and heterophilic characteristics of real-world graphs. In particular, many real-world graphs are non-homophilic, not strictly or uniformly homophilic with mixing homophilic and heterophilic patterns, exhibiting varying non-homophilic characteristics across graphs and nodes. In this paper, we propose ProNoG, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for such non-homophilic graphs. First, we analyze existing graph pre-training methods, providing theoretical insights into the choice of pre-training tasks. Second, recognizing that each node exhibits unique non-homophilic characteristics, we propose a conditional network to characterize the node-specific patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze ProNoG through extensive experiments on ten public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Li, Weikai Yang, Jun Yuan, Jing Wu, Changjian Chen, Yao Ming, Fan Yang, Hui Zhang, Shixia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The high performance of tree ensemble classifiers benefits from a large set of rules, which, in turn, makes the models hard to understand. To improve interpretability, existing methods extract a subset of rules for approximation using model reduction techniques. However, by focusing on the reduced rule set, these methods often lose fidelity and ignore anomalous rules that, despite their infrequency, play crucial roles in real-world applications. This paper introduces a scalable visual analysis method to explain tree ensemble classifiers that contain tens of thousands of rules. The key idea is to address the issue of losing fidelity by adaptively organizing the rules as a hierarchy rather than reducing them. To ensure the inclusion of anomalous rules, we develop an anomaly-biased model reduction method to prioritize these rules at each hierarchical level. Synergized with this hierarchical organization of rules, we develop a matrix-based hierarchical visualization to support exploration at different levels of detail. Our quantitative experiments and case studies demonstrate how our method fosters a deeper understanding of both common and anomalous rules, thereby enhancing interpretability without sacrificing comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems infer human preferences by presenting queries as pairs of options and collecting binary choices. Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation. We incorporate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that using response times significantly accelerates preference learning compared to choice-only approaches.

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid developments of AI tools are expected to offer unprecedented assistance to the research of natural science including chemistry. However, neither existing unimodal task-specific specialist models nor emerging general large multimodal models (LMM) can cover the wide range of chemical data modality and task categories. To address the real demands of chemists, a cross-modal Chemical General Intelligence (CGI) system, which serves as a truly practical and useful research assistant utilizing the great potential of LMMs, is in great need. In this work, we introduce the first Cross-modal Dialogue Foundation Model for Chemistry (ChemDFM-X). Diverse multimodal data are generated from an initial modality by approximate calculations and task-specific model predictions. This strategy creates sufficient chemical training corpora, while significantly reducing excessive expense, resulting in an instruction-tuning dataset containing 7.6M data. After instruction finetuning, ChemDFM-X is evaluated on extensive experiments of different chemical tasks with various data modalities. The results demonstrate the capacity of ChemDFM-X for multimodal and inter-modal knowledge comprehension. ChemDFM-X marks a significant milestone toward aligning all modalities in chemistry, a step closer to CGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yooseok Lim, Sujee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate medication dosing holds an important position in the overall patient therapeutic process. Therefore, much research has been conducted to develop optimal administration strategy based on Reinforcement learning (RL). However, Relying solely on a few explicitly defined reward functions makes it difficult to learn a treatment strategy that encompasses the diverse characteristics of various patients. Moreover, the multitude of drugs utilized in clinical practice makes it infeasible to construct a dedicated reward function for each medication. Here, we tried to develop a reward network that captures clinicians' therapeutic intentions, departing from explicit rewards, and to derive an optimal heparin dosing policy. In this study, we introduce Offline Model-based Guided Reward Learning (OMG-RL), which performs offline inverse RL (IRL). Through OMG-RL, we learn a parameterized reward function that captures the expert's intentions from limited data, thereby enhancing the agent's policy. We validate the proposed approach on the heparin dosing task. We show that OMG-RL policy is positively reinforced not only in terms of the learned reward network but also in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), a key indicator for monitoring the effects of heparin. This means that the OMG-RL policy adequately reflects clinician's intentions. This approach can be widely utilized not only for the heparin dosing problem but also for RL-based medication dosing tasks in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, John Sabatini, Conrad Borchers, Daniel Weitekamp, Meng Cao, John Hollander, Xiangen Hu, Arthur C. Graesser</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning performance data describe correct and incorrect answers or problem-solving attempts in adaptive learning, such as in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Learning performance data tend to be highly sparse (80\%\(\sim\)90\% missing observations) in most real-world applications due to adaptive item selection. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict future performance explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learner data to address data sparsity in learning performance data. First, learning performance is represented as a three-dimensional tensor of learners' questions, answers, and attempts, capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, a module for generating patterns of learning is used. This study contrasts two forms of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generate Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) to generate data associated with different clusters of learner data. We tested this approach on an adult literacy dataset from AutoTutor lessons developed for Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC). We found that: (1) tensor factorization improved the performance in tracing and predicting knowledge mastery compared with other knowledge tracing techniques without data augmentation, showing higher relative fidelity for this imputation method, and (2) the GAN-based simulation showed greater overall stability and less statistical bias based on a divergence evaluation with varying simulation sample sizes compared to GPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochuan Gong, Jie Hao, Mingrui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates a class of stochastic bilevel optimization problems where the upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. These problems have significant applications in sequential data learning, such as text classification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is characterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling linearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing state-of-the-art algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ oracle calls of stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further improve the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the population level also hold for each random realization almost surely (e.g., Lipschitzness of each realization of the stochastic gradient). To address this issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm named AccBO. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level variable by the stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with averaging. We prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Our proof relies on a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high probability for the lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and also plays a crucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over time. Experimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm achieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms baselines in bilevel optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Pengmei, Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Spencer C. Guo, Jonathan Weare, Aaron R. Dinner</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying informative low-dimensional features that characterize dynamics in molecular simulations remains a challenge, often requiring extensive manual tuning and system-specific knowledge. Here, we introduce geom2vec, in which pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as universal geometric featurizers. By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we obtain transferable structural representations that are useful for learning conformational dynamics without further fine-tuning. We show how the learned GNN representations can capture interpretable relationships between structural units (tokens) by combining them with expressive token mixers. Importantly, decoupling training the GNNs from training for downstream tasks enables analysis of larger molecular graphs (such as small proteins at all-atom resolution) with limited computational resources. In these ways, geom2vec eliminates the need for manual feature selection and increases the robustness of simulation analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Sam Chen, Christopher Beckham, Zixuan Liu, Xue Liu, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline black-box optimization aims to maximize a black-box function using an offline dataset of designs and their measured properties. Two main approaches have emerged: the forward approach, which learns a mapping from input to its value, thereby acting as a proxy to guide optimization, and the inverse approach, which learns a mapping from value to input for conditional generation. (a) Although proxy-free~(classifier-free) diffusion shows promise in robustly modeling the inverse mapping, it lacks explicit guidance from proxies, essential for generating high-performance samples beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we propose \textit{proxy-enhanced sampling} which utilizes the explicit guidance from a trained proxy to bolster proxy-free diffusion with enhanced sampling control. (b) Yet, the trained proxy is susceptible to out-of-distribution issues. To address this, we devise the module \textit{diffusion-based proxy refinement}, which seamlessly integrates insights from proxy-free diffusion back into the proxy for refinement. To sum up, we propose \textit{\textbf{R}obust \textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}iffusion for Offline Black-box Optimization}~(\textbf{RGD}), combining the advantages of proxy~(explicit guidance) and proxy-free diffusion~(robustness) for effective conditional generation. RGD achieves state-of-the-art results on various design-bench tasks, underscoring its efficacy. Our code is at https://github.com/GGchen1997/RGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuling Jiao, Huazhen Lin, Yuchen Luo, Jerry Zhijian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a framework for deep transfer learning, which aims to leverage information from multi-domain upstream data with a large number of samples $n$ to a single-domain downstream task with a considerably smaller number of samples $m$, where $m \ll n$, in order to enhance performance on downstream task. Our framework has several intriguing features. First, it allows the existence of both shared and specific features among multi-domain data and provides a framework for automatic identification, achieving precise transfer and utilization of information. Second, our model framework explicitly indicates the upstream features that contribute to downstream tasks, establishing a relationship between upstream domains and downstream tasks, thereby enhancing interpretability. Error analysis demonstrates that the transfer under our framework can significantly improve the convergence rate for learning Lipschitz functions in downstream supervised tasks, reducing it from $\tilde{O}(m^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}}+n^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}})$ ("no transfer") to $\tilde{O}(m^{-\frac{1}{2(d^*+3)}} + n^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}})$ ("partial transfer"), and even to $\tilde{O}(m^{-1/2}+n^{-\frac{1}{2(d+2)}})$ ("complete transfer"), where $d^* \ll d$ and $d$ is the dimension of the observed data. Our theoretical findings are substantiated by empirical experiments conducted on image classification datasets, along with a regression dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Gracyk</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture, frequently reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) error between 15% to 35% on select datasets. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saba Zerefa, Zhaolin Ren, Haitong Ma, Na Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average regret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Liu, Minghui Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Li, Yangfan He, Lewei He, Jianhui Wang, Tianyu Shi, Bin Lei, Yuchen Li, Qiuwu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

<p>Abstract: Missing data imputation is a critical challenge in various domains, such as healthcare and finance, where data completeness is vital for accurate analysis. Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating the risk of LLM hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot learning LLM "trees" with confidence-based weighted voting, inspired by ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhang, Xiaoyang Hou, Zhihua Tian, Yan he, Enchao Gong, Jian Liu, Qingbiao Wu, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that partitions the nodes in a graph into different groups. Despite achieving significant progress in exploiting both attributed and structured data information, graph clustering methods often face practical challenges related to data isolation. Moreover, the absence of collaborative methods for graph clustering limits their effectiveness.
  In this paper, we propose a collaborative graph clustering framework for attributed graphs, supporting attributed graph clustering over vertically partitioned data with different participants holding distinct features of the same data. Our method leverages a novel technique that reduces the sample space, improving the efficiency of the attributed graph clustering method. Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart under a proximity condition, demonstrating that the successful local results of each participant contribute to the overall success of the collaboration.
  We fully implement our approach and evaluate its utility and efficiency by conducting experiments on four public datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy levels to centralized attributed graph clustering methods. Our collaborative graph clustering framework provides an efficient and effective solution for graph clustering challenges related to data isolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Schestakov, Simon Gottschalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Xu, Hanyin Cheng, Chenjuan Guo, Hongfan Gao, Jilin Hu, Sean Bin Yang, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing effective path representations has become increasingly essential across various fields within intelligent transportation. Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path.

<p>Abstract: Task Arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet effective method to merge models without additional training. However, by treating entire networks as flat parameter vectors, it overlooks key structural information and is susceptible to task interference. In this paper, we study task vectors at the layer level, focusing on task layer matrices and their singular value decomposition. In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. We further leverage this low-rank space to define a new measure of task interference based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that combines compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leizhen Wang, Peibo Duan, Zhengbing He, Cheng Lyu, Xin Chen, Nan Zheng, Li Yao, Zhenliang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding travelers' route choices can help policymakers devise optimal operational and planning strategies for both normal and abnormal circumstances. However, existing choice modeling methods often rely on predefined assumptions and struggle to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of travel behavior. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating remarkable ability to replicate human-like behaviors across various fields. Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate human route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful. To satisfy this curiosity, this paper investigates the potential of LLMs for route choice modeling by introducing an LLM-empowered agent, "LLMTraveler." This agent integrates an LLM as its core, equipped with a memory system that learns from past experiences and makes decisions by balancing retrieved data and personality traits. The study systematically evaluates the LLMTraveler's ability to replicate human-like decision-making through two stages of day-to-day (DTD) congestion games: (1) analyzing its route-switching behavior in single origin-destination (OD) pair scenarios, where it demonstrates patterns that align with laboratory data but cannot be fully explained by traditional models, and (2) testing its capacity to model adaptive learning behaviors in multi-OD scenarios on the Ortuzar and Willumsen (OW) network, producing results comparable to Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. These experiments demonstrate that the framework can partially replicate human-like decision-making in route choice while providing natural language explanations for its decisions. This capability offers valuable insights for transportation policymaking, such as simulating traveler responses to new policies or changes in the network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santiago Aranguri, Francesco Insulla</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the training of a two-layer autoencoder used to parameterize a flow-based generative model for sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture. Previous work shows that the phase where the relative probability between the modes is learned disappears as the dimension goes to infinity without an appropriate time schedule. We introduce a time dilation that solves this problem. This enables us to characterize the learned velocity field, finding a first phase where the probability of each mode is learned and a second phase where the variance of each mode is learned. We find that the autoencoder representing the velocity field learns to simplify by estimating only the parameters relevant to each phase. Turning to real data, we propose a method that, for a given feature, finds intervals of time where training improves accuracy the most on that feature. Since practitioners take a uniform distribution over training times, our method enables more efficient training. We provide preliminary experiments validating this approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Fang, Yuxuan Liang, Bo Hui, Zezhi Shao, Liwei Deng, Xu Liu, Xinke Jiang, Kai Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Road traffic forecasting is crucial in real-world intelligent transportation scenarios like traffic dispatching and path planning in city management and personal traveling. Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) stand out as the mainstream solution in this task. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity of remarkable dynamic spatial modeling-based STGNNs has become the bottleneck over large-scale traffic data. From the spatial data management perspective, we present a novel Transformer framework called PatchSTG to efficiently and dynamically model spatial dependencies for large-scale traffic forecasting with interpretability and fidelity. Specifically, we design a novel irregular spatial patching to reduce the number of points involved in the dynamic calculation of Transformer. The irregular spatial patching first utilizes the leaf K-dimensional tree (KDTree) to recursively partition irregularly distributed traffic points into leaf nodes with a small capacity, and then merges leaf nodes belonging to the same subtree into occupancy-equaled and non-overlapped patches through padding and backtracking. Based on the patched data, depth and breadth attention are used interchangeably in the encoder to dynamically learn local and global spatial knowledge from points in a patch and points with the same index of patches. Experimental results on four real world large-scale traffic datasets show that our PatchSTG achieves train speed and memory utilization improvements up to $10\times$ and $4\times$ with the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renqiang Luo, Huafei Huang, Ivan Lee, Chengpei Xu, Jianzhong Qi, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted significant fairness issues in Graph Transformer (GT) models, particularly against subgroups defined by sensitive features. Additionally, GTs are computationally intensive and memory-demanding, limiting their application to large-scale graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that graph partitioning can enhance the fairness of GT models while reducing computational complexity. To understand this improvement, we conducted a theoretical investigation into the root causes of fairness issues in GT models. We found that the sensitive features of higher-order nodes disproportionately influence lower-order nodes, resulting in sensitive feature bias. We propose Fairness-aware scalable GT based on Graph Partitioning (FairGP), which partitions the graph to minimize the negative impact of higher-order nodes. By optimizing attention mechanisms, FairGP mitigates the bias introduced by global attention, thereby enhancing fairness. Extensive empirical evaluations on six real-world datasets validate the superior performance of FairGP in achieving fairness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Wang, Zhaoxuan Wu, Fusheng Liu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative machine learning (CML) provides a promising paradigm for democratizing advanced technologies by enabling cost-sharing among participants. However, the potential for rent-seeking behaviors among parties can undermine such collaborations. Contract theory presents a viable solution by rewarding participants with models of varying accuracy based on their contributions. However, unlike monetary compensation, using models as rewards introduces unique challenges, particularly due to the stochastic nature of these rewards when contribution costs are privately held information. This paper formalizes the optimal contracting problem within CML and proposes a transformation that simplifies the non-convex optimization problem into one that can be solved through convex optimization algorithms. We conduct a detailed analysis of the properties that an optimal contract must satisfy when models serve as the rewards, and we explore the potential benefits and welfare implications of these contract-driven CML schemes through numerical experiments.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738">Improving Graph Neural Network Training Efficiency By Using Top Non-Robust Samples In The Training Set</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and the data features, which can significantly degrade their performance in common tasks such as classification and prediction. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for constructing training sets by identifying training samples that are particularly sensitive to noise for a given model. These samples are then used to enhance the model's ability to handle noise-prone instances effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang He, Yash Jain, Xubo Liu, Andrew Markham, Vibhav Vineet</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: https://github.com/yuhanghe01/RiTTA</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uzoamaka Ezeakunne, Chrisantus Eze, Xiuwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the progress made in deepfake detection research, recent studies have shown that biases in the training data for these detectors can result in varying levels of performance across different demographic groups, such as race and gender. These disparities can lead to certain groups being unfairly targeted or excluded. Traditional methods often rely on fair loss functions to address these issues, but they under-perform when applied to unseen datasets, hence, fairness generalization remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for tackling the fairness generalization problem in deepfake detection by leveraging synthetic datasets and model optimization. Our approach focuses on generating and utilizing synthetic data to enhance fairness across diverse demographic groups. By creating a diverse set of synthetic samples that represent various demographic groups, we ensure that our model is trained on a balanced and representative dataset. This approach allows us to generalize fairness more effectively across different domains. We employ a comprehensive strategy that leverages synthetic data, a loss sharpness-aware optimization pipeline, and a multi-task learning framework to create a more equitable training environment, which helps maintain fairness across both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Extensive experiments on benchmark deepfake detection datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches in preserving fairness during cross-dataset evaluation. Our results highlight the potential of synthetic datasets in achieving fairness generalization, providing a robust solution for the challenges faced in deepfake detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring long-term fairness is crucial when developing automated decision making systems, specifically in dynamic and sequential environments. By maximizing their reward without consideration of fairness, AI agents can introduce disparities in their treatment of groups or individuals. In this paper, we establish the connection between bisimulation metrics and group fairness in reinforcement learning. We propose a novel approach that leverages bisimulation metrics to learn reward functions and observation dynamics, ensuring that learners treat groups fairly while reflecting the original problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in addressing disparities in sequential decision making problems through empirical evaluation on a standard fairness benchmark consisting of lending and college admission scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifang Chen, Jiayan Huo, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the SETH, the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfredo Fernandez, Ankur Mali</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the Hyperbolic Tangent Exponential Linear Unit (TeLU), a neural network hidden activation function defined as TeLU(x)=xtanh(exp(x)). TeLU's design is grounded in the core principles of key activation functions, achieving strong convergence by closely approximating the identity function in its active region while effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient problem in its saturating region. Its simple formulation enhances computational efficiency, leading to improvements in scalability and convergence speed. Unlike many modern activation functions, TeLU seamlessly combines the simplicity and effectiveness of ReLU with the smoothness and analytic properties essential for learning stability in deep neural networks. TeLU's ability to mimic the behavior and optimal hyperparameter settings of ReLU, while introducing the benefits of smoothness and curvature, makes it an ideal drop-in replacement. Its analytic nature positions TeLU as a powerful universal approximator, enhancing both robustness and generalization across a multitude of experiments. We rigorously validate these claims through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating TeLU's performance across challenging benchmarks; including ResNet18 on ImageNet, Dynamic-Pooling Transformers on Text8, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on the Penn TreeBank dataset. These results highlight TeLU's potential to set a new standard in activation functions, driving more efficient and stable learning in deep neural networks, thereby accelerating scientific discoveries across various fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to limited memory and processing power. In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Singh, Hannah Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: A core challenge in causal inference is how to extrapolate long term effects, of possibly continuous actions, from short term experimental data. It arises in artificial intelligence: the long term consequences of continuous actions may be of interest, yet only short term rewards may be collected in exploration. For this estimand, called the long term dose response curve, we propose a simple nonparametric estimator based on kernel ridge regression. By embedding the distribution of the short term experimental data with kernels, we derive interpretable weights for extrapolating long term effects. Our method allows actions, short term rewards, and long term rewards to be continuous in general spaces. It also allows for nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the link between short term effects and long term effects. We prove uniform consistency, with nonasymptotic error bounds reflecting the effective dimension of the data. As an application, we estimate the long term dose response curve of Project STAR, a social program which randomly assigned students to various class sizes. We extend our results to long term counterfactual distributions, proving weak convergence.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09019">Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with One-hop Neighbors and Compute Straggler Mitigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Baoqian Wang, Junfei Xie, Nikolay Atanasov</p>
<p>Abstract: Most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods are limited in the scale of problems they can handle. With increasing numbers of agents, the number of training iterations required to find the optimal behaviors increases exponentially due to the exponentially growing joint state and action spaces. This paper tackles this limitation by introducing a scalable MARL method called Distributed multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with One-hop Neighbors (DARL1N). DARL1N is an off-policy actor-critic method that addresses the curse of dimensionality by restricting information exchanges among the agents to one-hop neighbors when representing value and policy functions. Each agent optimizes its value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood, significantly reducing the learning complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness by training with varying neighbor numbers and states. This structure allows us to formulate a distributed learning framework to further speed up the training procedure. Distributed computing systems, however, contain straggler compute nodes, which are slow or unresponsive due to communication bottlenecks, software or hardware problems. To mitigate the detrimental straggler effect, we introduce a novel coded distributed learning architecture, which leverages coding theory to improve the resilience of the learning system to stragglers. Comprehensive experiments show that DARL1N significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality and is scalable as the number of agents increases. Moreover, the coded distributed learning architecture improves training efficiency in the presence of stragglers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structure remains an unsolved challenge. Determining RNA 3D structures is crucial for understanding their functions and informing RNA-targeting drug development and synthetic biology design. The structural flexibility of RNA, which leads to scarcity of experimentally determined data, complicates computational prediction efforts. Here, we present RhoFold+, an RNA language model-based deep learning method that accurately predicts 3D structures of single-chain RNAs from sequences. By integrating an RNA language model pre-trained on ~23.7 million RNA sequences and leveraging techniques to address data scarcity, RhoFold+ offers a fully automated end-to-end pipeline for RNA 3D structure prediction. Retrospective evaluations on RNA-Puzzles and CASP15 natural RNA targets demonstrate RhoFold+'s superiority over existing methods, including human expert groups. Its efficacy and generalizability are further validated through cross-family and cross-type assessments, as well as time-censored benchmarks. Additionally, RhoFold+ predicts RNA secondary structures and inter-helical angles, providing empirically verifiable features that broaden its applicability to RNA structure and function studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Xue, Yutong Wang, Cong Guan, Lei Yuan, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Chao Qian, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating agents that can achieve zero-shot coordination (ZSC) with unseen partners is a new challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may be inefficient. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on various heterogeneous tasks highlight the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous ZSC tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Hess, Markus Dr\"uke, Stefan Petri, Felix M. Strnad, Niklas Boers</p>
<p>Abstract: Precipitation results from complex processes across many scales, making its accurate simulation in Earth system models (ESMs) challenging. Existing post-processing methods can improve ESM simulations locally, but cannot correct errors in modelled spatial patterns. Here we propose a framework based on physically constrained generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve local distributions and spatial structure simultaneously. We apply our approach to the computationally efficient ESM CM2Mc-LPJmL. Our method outperforms existing ones in correcting local distributions, and leads to strongly improved spatial patterns especially regarding the intermittency of daily precipitation. Notably, a double-peaked Intertropical Convergence Zone, a common problem in ESMs, is removed. Enforcing a physical constraint to preserve global precipitation sums, the GAN can generalize to future climate scenarios unseen during training. Feature attribution shows that the GAN identifies regions where the ESM exhibits strong biases. Our method constitutes a general framework for correcting ESM variables and enables realistic simulations at a fraction of the computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Pan Zhou, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the long-range modeling ability of ViTs, large-kernel convolutions are widely studied and adopted recently to enlarge the receptive field and improve model performance, like the remarkable work ConvNeXt which employs 7x7 depthwise convolution. Although such depthwise operator only consumes a few FLOPs, it largely harms the model efficiency on powerful computing devices due to the high memory access costs. For example, ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves ~60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed, it results in significant performance degradation, which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension, i.e., small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution, we build a series of networks, namely IncepitonNeXt, which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance, InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T, as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K. We anticipate InceptionNeXt can serve as an economical baseline for future architecture design to reduce carbon footprint. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from pre-existing datasets without further interactions, making it a challenging task. Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents' information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that MADiff outperforms baseline algorithms across various multi-agent learning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niraj Kumar, Romina Yalovetzky, Changhao Li, Pierre Minssen, Marco Pistoia</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision trees are widely adopted machine learning models due to their simplicity and explainability. However, as training data size grows, standard methods become increasingly slow, scaling polynomially with the number of training examples. In this work, we introduce Des-q, a novel quantum algorithm to construct and retrain decision trees for regression and binary classification tasks. Assuming the data stream produces small, periodic increments of new training examples, Des-q significantly reduces the tree retraining time. Des-q achieves a logarithmic complexity in the combined total number of old and new examples, even accounting for the time needed to load the new samples into quantum-accessible memory. Our approach to grow the tree from any given node involves performing piecewise linear splits to generate multiple hyperplanes, thus partitioning the input feature space into distinct regions. To determine the suitable anchor points for these splits, we develop an efficient quantum-supervised clustering method, building upon the q-means algorithm introduced by Kerenidis et al. We benchmark the simulated version of Des-q against the state-of-the-art classical methods on multiple data sets and observe that our algorithm exhibits similar performance to the state-of-the-art decision trees while significantly speeding up the periodic tree retraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-set recognition (OSR), the identification of novel categories, can be a critical component when deploying classification models in real-world applications. Recent work has shown that familiarity-based scoring rules such as the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) or the Maximum Logit Score (MLS) are strong baselines when the closed-set accuracy is high. However, one of the potential weaknesses of familiarity-based OSR are adversarial attacks. Here, we study gradient-based adversarial attacks on familiarity scores for both types of attacks, False Familiarity and False Novelty attacks, and evaluate their effectiveness in informed and uninformed settings on TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we explore how novel and familiar samples react to adversarial attacks and formulate the adversarial reaction score as an alternative OSR scoring rule, which shows a high correlation with the MLS familiarity score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sojeong Song, Seoyun Yang, Chang D. Yoo, Junmo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal steganography is committed to hiding secret information of one modality in another modality. Despite the advancement in the field of steganography by the introduction of deep learning, cross-modal steganography still remains to be a challenge to the field. The incompatibility between different modalities not only complicate the hiding process but also results in increased vulnerability to detection. To rectify these limitations, we present INRSteg, an innovative cross-modal steganography framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). We introduce a novel network allocating framework with a masked parameter update which facilitates hiding multiple data and enables cross modality across image, audio, video and 3D shape. Moreover, we eliminate the necessity of training a deep neural network and therefore substantially reduce the memory and computational cost and avoid domain adaptation issues. To the best of our knowledge, in the field of steganography, this is the first to introduce diverse modalities to both the secret and cover data. Detailed experiments in extreme modality settings demonstrate the flexibility, security, and robustness of INRSteg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul S. Clarke, Annalivia Polselli</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in causal inference have seen the development of methods which make use of the predictive power of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we develop novel double machine learning (DML) procedures for panel data in which these algorithms are used to approximate high-dimensional and nonlinear nuisance functions of the covariates. Our new procedures are extensions of the well-known correlated random effects, within-group and first-difference estimators from linear to nonlinear panel models, specifically, Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model with fixed effects and unspecified nonlinear confounding. Our simulation study assesses the performance of these procedures using different machine learning algorithms. We use our procedures to re-estimate the impact of minimum wage on voting behaviour in the UK. From our results, we recommend the use of first-differencing because it imposes the fewest constraints on the distribution of the fixed effects, and an ensemble learning strategy to ensure optimum estimator accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Xu, Yi Qin, Lu Mi, Hao Wang, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods, such as concept bottleneck models (CBMs), have been successful in providing concept-based interpretations for black-box deep learning models. They typically work by predicting concepts given the input and then predicting the final class label given the predicted concepts. However, (1) they often fail to capture the high-order, nonlinear interaction between concepts, e.g., correcting a predicted concept (e.g., "yellow breast") does not help correct highly correlated concepts (e.g., "yellow belly"), leading to suboptimal final accuracy; (2) they cannot naturally quantify the complex conditional dependencies between different concepts and class labels (e.g., for an image with the class label "Kentucky Warbler" and a concept "black bill", what is the probability that the model correctly predicts another concept "black crown"), therefore failing to provide deeper insight into how a black-box model works. In response to these limitations, we propose Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Our ECBMs use a set of neural networks to define the joint energy of candidate (input, concept, class) tuples. With such a unified interface, prediction, concept correction, and conditional dependency quantification are then represented as conditional probabilities, which are generated by composing different energy functions. Our ECBMs address both limitations of existing CBMs, providing higher accuracy and richer concept interpretations. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Beauchamp, Ronan Fablet, Simon Benaichouche, Pierre Tandeo, Nicolas Desassis, Bertrand Chapron</p>
<p>Abstract: The spatio-temporal interpolation of large geophysical datasets has historically been addressed by Optimal Interpolation (OI) and more sophisticated equation-based or data-driven Data Assimilation (DA) techniques. Recent advances in the deep learning community enables to address the interpolation problem through a neural architecture incorporating a variational data assimilation framework. The reconstruction task is seen as a joint learning problem of the prior involved in the variational inner cost, seen as a projection operator of the state, and the gradient-based minimization of the latter. Both prior models and solvers are stated as neural networks with automatic differentiation which can be trained by minimizing a loss function, typically the mean squared error between some ground truth and the reconstruction. Such a strategy turns out to be very efficient to improve the mean state estimation, but still needs complementary developments to quantify its related uncertainty. In this work, we use the theory of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) and Gaussian Processes (GP) to estimate both space-and time-varying covariance of the state. Our neural variational scheme is modified to embed an augmented state formulation with both state and SPDE parametrization to estimate. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework on a spatio-temporal GP driven by diffusion-based anisotropies and on realistic Sea Surface Height (SSH) datasets. We show how our solution reaches the OI baseline in the Gaussian case. For nonlinear dynamics, as almost always stated in DA, our solution outperforms OI, while allowing for fast and interpretable online parameter estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Peralez, Aur\'elien Delage, Olivier Buffet, Jilles S. Dibangoye</p>
<p>Abstract: A recent theory shows that a multi-player decentralized partially observable Markov decision process can be transformed into an equivalent single-player game, enabling the application of \citeauthor{bellman}'s principle of optimality to solve the single-player game by breaking it down into single-stage subgames. However, this approach entangles the decision variables of all players at each single-stage subgame, resulting in backups with a double-exponential complexity. This paper demonstrates how to disentangle these decision variables while maintaining optimality under hierarchical information sharing, a prominent management style in our society. To achieve this, we apply the principle of optimality to solve any single-stage subgame by breaking it down further into smaller subgames, enabling us to make single-player decisions at a time. Our approach reveals that extensive-form games always exist with solutions to a single-stage subgame, significantly reducing time complexity. Our experimental results show that the algorithms leveraging these findings can scale up to much larger multi-player games without compromising optimality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Wang, Yihao Feng, Tian Lan, Ning Yu, Yu Bai, Ran Xu, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language serves as a common and straightforward signal for humans to interact seamlessly with machines. Recognizing the importance of this interface, the machine learning community is investing considerable effort in generating data that is semantically coherent with textual instructions. While strides have been made in text-to-data generation spanning image editing, audio synthesis, video creation, and beyond, low-resource areas characterized by expensive annotations or complex data structures, such as molecules, motion dynamics, and time series, often lack textual labels. This deficiency impedes supervised learning, thereby constraining the application of advanced generative models for text-to-data tasks. In response to these challenges in the low-resource scenario, we propose Text2Data, a novel approach that utilizes unlabeled data to understand the underlying data distribution through an unsupervised diffusion model. Subsequently, it undergoes controllable finetuning via a novel constraint optimization-based learning objective that ensures controllability and effectively counteracts catastrophic forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Data is able to achieve enhanced performance regarding controllability across various modalities, including molecules, motions and time series, when compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Hess, Michael Aich, Baoxiang Pan, Niklas Boers</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rithwik Gupta, Daniel Muthukrishna, Michelle Lochner</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients, with modern survey telescopes generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, Multi-Class Isolation Forests (\texttt{MCIF}), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation and helps the neural network handle irregular sampling and model inter-passband relationships. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations matching the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method discovered $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsuan-Cheng Liao, Chih-Hong Cheng, Hasan Esen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents Ego-Centric Intersection-over-Union (EC-IoU), addressing the limitation of the standard IoU measure in characterizing safety-related performance for object detectors in navigating contexts. Concretely, we propose a weighting mechanism to refine IoU, allowing it to assign a higher score to a prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical evaluation processes to select object detectors with better safety-related performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean Average Precision as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Niedermayer, Pietro Saggese, Bernhard Haslhofer</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of bots in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) fosters efficiency and automation. However, their use is also associated with predatory trading and market manipulation, and can pose threats to system integrity. It is therefore essential to understand the extent of bot deployment in DLTs; despite this, current detection systems are predominantly rule-based and lack flexibility. In this study, we present a novel approach that utilizes machine learning for the detection of financial bots on the Ethereum platform. First, we systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to establish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24 subcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human and 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The highest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6%, while the highest-performing model for binary classification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83%. Our machine learning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Naraki, Ryosuke Yamaki, Yoshikazu Ikeda, Takafumi Horie, Kotaro Yoshida, Ryotaro Shimizu, Hiroki Naganuma</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Named Entity Recognition (NER) is recognized as a critical technology, employed across a wide array of applications. Traditional methodologies for annotating datasets for NER models are challenged by high costs and variations in dataset quality. This research introduces a novel hybrid annotation approach that synergizes human effort with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach not only aims to ameliorate the noise inherent in manual annotations, such as omissions, thereby enhancing the performance of NER models, but also achieves this in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, by employing a label mixing strategy, it addresses the issue of class imbalance encountered in LLM-based annotations. Through an analysis across multiple datasets, this method has been consistently shown to provide superior performance compared to traditional annotation methods, even under constrained budget conditions. This study illuminates the potential of leveraging LLMs to improve dataset quality, introduces a novel technique to mitigate class imbalances, and demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-performance NER in a cost-effective way.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08877">Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.
  In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.</p>

<p>Abstract: The burgeoning landscape of text-to-image models, exemplified by innovations such as Midjourney and DALLE 3, has revolutionized content creation across diverse sectors. However, these advancements bring forth critical ethical concerns, particularly with the misuse of open-source models to generate content that violates societal norms. Addressing this, we introduce Ethical-Lens, a framework designed to facilitate the value-aligned usage of text-to-image tools without necessitating internal model revision. Ethical-Lens ensures value alignment in text-to-image models across toxicity and bias dimensions by refining user commands and rectifying model outputs. Systematic evaluation metrics, combining GPT4-V, HEIM, and FairFace scores, assess alignment capability. Our experiments reveal that Ethical-Lens enhances alignment capabilities to levels comparable with or superior to commercial models like DALLE 3, ensuring user-generated content adheres to ethical standards while maintaining image quality. This study indicates the potential of Ethical-Lens to ensure the sustainable development of open-source text-to-image tools and their beneficial integration into society.

<p>Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive signal that is used in the recognition of hand movement patterns, the diagnosis of diseases, and the robust control of prostheses. Despite the remarkable success of recent end-to-end Deep Learning approaches, they are still limited by the need for large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the requirement for big data, we propose utilizing a feature-imitating network (FIN) for closed-form temporal feature learning over a 300ms signal window on Ninapro DB2, and applying it to the task of 17 hand movement recognition. We implement a lightweight LSTM-FIN network to imitate four standard temporal features (entropy, root mean square, variance, simple square integral). We observed that the LSTM-FIN network can achieve up to 99\% R2 accuracy in feature reconstruction and 80\% accuracy in hand movement recognition. Our results also showed that the model can be robustly applied for both within- and cross-subject movement recognition, as well as simulated low-latency environments. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of the FIN modeling paradigm in data-scarce scenarios for sEMG signal processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Qi, Li Lin, Jiajun Wang, Bin Zhang, Jingya Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation in PET/CT images is crucial for computer-aided cancer diagnosis and treatment. The primary challenge lies in effectively integrating the complementary information from PET and CT images. In clinical settings, the quality of PET and CT images often varies significantly, leading to uncertainty in the modality information extracted by networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-modal Evidential Fusion Network (MEFN), which consists of two core stages: Cross-Modal Feature Learning (CFL) and Multi-modal Trustworthy Fusion (MTF). The CFL stage aligns features across different modalities and learns more robust feature representations, thereby alleviating the negative effects of domain gap. The MTF stage utilizes mutual attention mechanisms and an uncertainty calibrator to fuse modality features based on modality uncertainty and then fuse the segmentation results under the guidance of Dempster-Shafer Theory. Besides, a new uncertainty perceptual loss is introduced to force the model focusing on uncertain features and hence improve its ability to extract trusted modality information. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on two publicly available PET/CT datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed method whose results demonstrate that our MEFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improvements of 3.10% and 3.23% in DSC scores on the AutoPET dataset and the Hecktor dataset, respectively. More importantly, our model can provide radiologists with credible uncertainty of the segmentation results for their decision in accepting or rejecting the automatic segmentation results, which is particularly important for clinical applications.

<p>Abstract: SimMIM is a widely used method for pretraining vision transformers using masked image modeling. However, despite its success in fine-tuning performance, it has been shown to perform sub-optimally when used for linear probing. We propose an efficient patch-wise weighting derived from keypoint features which captures the local information and provides better context during SimMIM's reconstruction phase. Our method, KAMIM, improves the top-1 linear probing accuracy from 16.12% to 33.97%, and finetuning accuracy from 76.78% to 77.3% when tested on the ImageNet-1K dataset with a ViT-B when trained for the same number of epochs. We conduct extensive testing on different datasets, keypoint extractors, and model architectures and observe that patch-wise weighting augments linear probing performance for larger pretraining datasets. We also analyze the learned representations of a ViT-B trained using KAMIM and observe that they behave similar to contrastive learning with regard to its behavior, with longer attention distances and homogenous self-attention across layers.

<p>Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob K Christopher, Brian R Bartoldson, Tal Ben-Nun, Michael Cardei, Bhavya Kailkhura, Ferdinando Fioretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a widely adopted method to accelerate large language model inference without sacrificing the quality of the model outputs. While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff), is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Weber, Carly Beneke, Clyde Wheeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Regular measurement of carbon stock in the world's forests is critical for carbon accounting and reporting under national and international climate initiatives, and for scientific research, but has been largely limited in scalability and temporal resolution due to a lack of ground based assessments. Increasing efforts have been made to address these challenges by incorporating remotely sensed data. We present a new methodology which uses multi-sensor, multi-spectral imagery at a resolution of 10 meters and a deep learning based model which unifies the prediction of above ground biomass density (AGBD), canopy height (CH), canopy cover (CC) as well as uncertainty estimations for all three quantities. The model is trained on millions of globally sampled GEDI-L2/L4 measurements. We validate the capability of our model by deploying it over the entire globe for the year 2023 as well as annually from 2016 to 2023 over selected areas. The model achieves a mean absolute error for AGBD (CH, CC) of 26.1 Mg/ha (3.7 m, 9.9 %) and a root mean squared error of 50.6 Mg/ha (5.4 m, 15.8 %) on a globally sampled test dataset, demonstrating a significant improvement over previously published results. We also report the model performance against independently collected ground measurements published in the literature, which show a high degree of correlation across varying conditions. We further show that our pre-trained model facilitates seamless transferability to other GEDI variables due to its multi-head architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adithya Rajnarayanan, Manoj Kumar, Abdessamad Tridane</p>
<p>Abstract: Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, every year millions of people become victims of this disease and many even lose their lives. Medical professionals and the government could take accurate measures to protect the people only when the disease dynamics are understood clearly. In this work, we propose a compartmental model to study the dynamics of malaria. We consider the transmission rate dependent on temperature and altitude. We performed the steady state analysis on the proposed model and checked the stability of the disease-free and endemic steady state. An artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the formulated model to predict the trajectory of all five compartments following the mathematical analysis. Three different neural network architectures namely Artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN), and Recurrent neural network (RNN) are used to estimate these parameters from the trajectory of the data. To understand the severity of a disease, it is essential to calculate the risk associated with the disease. In this work, the risk is calculated using dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) from the trajectory of the infected people.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pangpang Liu, Chengchun Shi, Will Wei Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical to recent advances in generative artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is widely applied to achieve this objective. A key step in RLHF is to learn the reward function from human feedback. However, human feedback is costly and time-consuming, making it essential to collect high-quality conversation data for human teachers to label. Additionally, different human teachers have different levels of expertise. It is thus critical to query the most appropriate teacher for their opinions. In this paper, we use offline reinforcement learning (RL) to formulate the alignment problem. Motivated by the idea of $D$-optimal design, we first propose a dual active reward learning algorithm for the simultaneous selection of conversations and teachers. Next, we apply pessimistic RL to solve the alignment problem, based on the learned reward estimator. Theoretically, we show that the reward estimator obtained through our proposed adaptive selection strategy achieves minimal generalized variance asymptotically, and prove that the sub-optimality of our pessimistic policy scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ with a given sample budget $T$. Through simulations and experiments on LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and its superiority over state-of-the-arts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Xu, Xiuyuan Cheng, Yao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Density estimation is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. We consider a modern approach using flow-based generative models, and propose Local Flow Matching ($\texttt{LFM}$), a computational framework for density estimation based on such models, which learn a continuous and invertible flow to map noise samples to data samples. Unlike existing methods, $\texttt{LFM}$ employs a simulation-free scheme and incrementally learns a sequence of Flow Matching sub-models. Each sub-model matches a diffusion process over a small step size in the data-to-noise direction. This iterative process reduces the gap between the two distributions interpolated by the sub-models, enabling smaller models with faster training times. Theoretically, we prove a generation guarantee of the proposed flow model regarding the $\chi^2$-divergence between the generated and true data distributions. Experimentally, we demonstrate the improved training efficiency and competitive generative performance of $\texttt{LFM}$ compared to FM on the unconditional generation of tabular data and image datasets and its applicability to robotic manipulation policy learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Wang, Anlin Zheng, Yucheng Zhao, Tiancai Wang, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Zhaoxiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces reconstructive visual instruction tuning (ROSS), a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that exploit vision-centric supervision signals. In contrast to conventional visual instruction tuning approaches that exclusively supervise text outputs, ROSS prompts LMMs to supervise visual outputs via reconstructing input images. By doing so, it capitalizes on the inherent richness and detail present within input images themselves, which are often lost in pure text supervision. However, producing meaningful feedback from natural images is challenging due to the heavy spatial redundancy of visual signals. To address this issue, ROSS employs a denoising objective to reconstruct latent representations of input images, avoiding directly regressing exact raw RGB values. This intrinsic activation design inherently encourages LMMs to maintain image detail, thereby enhancing their fine-grained comprehension capabilities and reducing hallucinations. Empirically, ROSS consistently brings significant improvements across different visual encoders and language models. In comparison with extrinsic assistance state-of-the-art alternatives that aggregate multiple visual experts, ROSS delivers competitive performance with a single SigLIP visual encoder, demonstrating the efficacy of our vision-centric supervision tailored for visual outputs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11900">FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Arakelyan, Pasquale Minervini, Pat Verga, Patrick Lewis, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13334">BiasJailbreak:Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Isack Lee, Haebin Seong</p>
<p>Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content bypassing safety alignments. In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and examine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords automatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to generate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method BiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually lead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more secure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we open-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community with tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parisa Hatami, Richard Annan, Luis Urias Miranda, Jane Gorman, Mengjun Xie, Letu Qingge, Hong Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying mutations of SARS-CoV-2 strains associated with their phenotypic changes is critical for pandemic prediction and prevention. We compared an explainable convolutional neural network (CNN) approach and the traditional genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the mutations associated with WHO labels of SARS-CoV-2, a proxy for virulence phenotypes. We trained a CNN classification model that can predict genomic sequences into Variants of Concern (VOCs) and then applied Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) model to identify mutations that are important for the correct predictions. For comparison, we performed traditional GWAS to identify mutations associated with VOCs. Comparison of the two approaches shows that the explainable neural network approach can more effectively reveal known nucleotide substitutions associated with VOCs, such as those in the spike gene regions. Our results suggest that explainable neural networks for genomic sequences offer a promising alternative to the traditional genome wide analysis approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daolang Huang, Yujia Guo, Luigi Acerbi, Samuel Kaski</p>
<p>Abstract: Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: CTC compressor can be an effective approach to integrate audio encoders to decoder-only models, which has gained growing interest for different speech applications. In this work, we propose a novel CTC compressor based joint speech and text training (CJST) framework for decoder-only ASR. CJST matches speech and text modalities from both directions by exploring a simple modality adaptor and several features of the CTC compressor, including sequence compression, on-the-fly forced peaky alignment and CTC class embeddings. Experimental results on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM2 corpora show that the proposed CJST achieves an effective text injection without the need of duration handling, leading to the best performance for both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. We also provide a comprehensive study on CTC compressor, covering various compression modes, edge case handling and behavior under both clean and noisy data conditions, which reveals the most robust setting to use CTC compressor for decoder-only models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudarshan Regmi</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensure the safe deployment of deep learning models in critical applications. Deep learning models can often misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This vulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training set. Likewise, in fine-grained classification settings, detection of fine-grained OOD samples becomes inherently challenging due to their high similarity to ID samples. However, current research on OOD detection has largely ignored these challenging scenarios, focusing instead on relatively easier (conventional) cases. In this work, we present a unified Approach to Spurious, fine-grained, and Conventional OOD Detection (ASCOOD). First, we propose synthesizing virtual outliers from ID data by approximating the destruction of invariant features. We identify invariant features with the pixel attribution method using the model being learned. This approach eliminates the burden of curating external OOD datasets. Then, we simultaneously incentivize ID classification and predictive uncertainty towards the virtual outliers leveraging standardized feature representation. Our approach effectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations and encourages capturing fine-grained attributes. Extensive experiments across six datasets demonstrate the merit of ASCOOD in spurious, fine-grained, and conventional settings. The code is available at: https://github.com/sudarshanregmi/ASCOOD/</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achieving optimal performance of video diffusion transformers within given data and compute budget is crucial due to their high training costs. This necessitates precisely determining the optimal model size and training hyperparameters before large-scale training. While scaling laws are employed in language models to predict performance, their existence and accurate derivation in visual generation models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically analyze scaling laws for video diffusion transformers and confirm their presence. Moreover, we discover that, unlike language models, video diffusion models are more sensitive to learning rate and batch size, two hyperparameters often not precisely modeled. To address this, we propose a new scaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and compute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance and reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods, within a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more generalized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and compute budget. This enables performance prediction for non-optimal model sizes, which may also be appealed under practical inference cost constraints, achieving a better trade-off.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their outstanding performance in handling graph-related tasks, such as social network analysis, protein design, and so on. Despite their widespread application, recent research has demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, implemented by injecting triggers into the training datasets. Trained on the poisoned data, GNNs will predict target labels when attaching trigger patterns to inputs. This vulnerability poses significant security risks for applications of GNNs in sensitive domains, such as drug discovery. While there has been extensive research into backdoor defenses for images, strategies to safeguard GNNs against such attacks remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, we point out that conventional backdoor defense methods designed for images cannot work well when directly implemented on graph data. In this paper, we first analyze the key difference between image backdoor and graph backdoor attacks. Then we tackle the graph defense problem by presenting a novel approach called MADE, which devises an adversarial mask generation mechanism that selectively preserves clean sub-graphs and further leverages masks on edge weights to eliminate the influence of triggers effectively. Extensive experiments across various graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MADE in significantly reducing the attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a high classification accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly necessary to quickly produce diverse and high-quality motion plans for downstream learning applications, such as distillation and imitation learning. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide a theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</p>

Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Ye, Yuyi Mao, Xianghao Yu, Shu Sun, Liqun Fu, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system for low-altitude economy (LAE), where a ground base station (GBS) provides communication and navigation services for authorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while sensing the low-altitude airspace to monitor the unauthorized mobile target. The expected communication sum-rate over a given flight period is maximized by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the GBS and UAVs' trajectories, subject to the constraints on the average signal-to-noise ratio requirement for sensing, the flight mission and collision avoidance of UAVs, as well as the maximum transmit power at the GBS. Typically, this is a sequential decision-making problem with the given flight mission. Thus, we transform it to a specific Markov decision process (MDP) model called episode task. Based on this modeling, we propose a novel LAE-oriented ISAC scheme, referred to as Deep LAE-ISAC (DeepLSC), by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. In DeepLSC, a reward function and a new action selection policy termed constrained noise-exploration policy are judiciously designed to fulfill various constraints. To enable efficient learning in episode tasks, we develop a hierarchical experience replay mechanism, where the gist is to employ all experiences generated within each episode to jointly train the neural network. Besides, to enhance the convergence speed of DeepLSC, a symmetric experience augmentation mechanism, which simultaneously permutes the indexes of all variables to enrich available experience sets, is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with benchmarks, DeepLSC yields a higher sum-rate while meeting the preset constraints, achieves faster convergence, and is more robust against different settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Schwimmbeck, Serouj Khajarian, Konstantin Holzapfel, Johannes Schmidt, Stefanie Remmele</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of medical Augmented Reality (AR) applications, object tracking is a key challenge and requires a significant amount of annotation masks. As segmentation foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) begin to emerge, zero-shot segmentation requires only minimal human participation obtaining high-quality object masks. We introduce a HoloLens-Object-Labeling (HOLa) Unity and Python application based on the SAM-Track algorithm that offers fully automatic single object annotation for HoloLens 2 while requiring minimal human participation. HOLa does not have to be adjusted to a specific image appearance and could thus alleviate AR research in any application field. We evaluate HOLa for different degrees of image complexity in open liver surgery and in medical phantom experiments. Using HOLa for image annotation can increase the labeling speed by more than 500 times while providing Dice scores between 0.875 and 0.982, which are comparable to human annotators. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mschwimmbeck/HOLa</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05313">{\lambda}: A Benchmark for Data-Efficiency in Long-Horizon Indoor Mobile Manipulation Robotics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Jaafar, Shreyas Sundara Raman, Yichen Wei, Sofia Juliani, Anneke Wernerfelt, Benedict Quartey, Ifrah Idrees, Jason Xinyu Liu, Stefanie Tellex</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuning Han, Bingyin Zhao, Rui Chu, Feng Luo, Biplab Sikdar, Yingjie Lao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that diffusion models (DMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks impose unconcealed triggers (e.g., a gray box and eyeglasses) that contain evident patterns, rendering remarkable attack effects yet easy detection upon human inspection and defensive algorithms. While it is possible to improve stealthiness by reducing the strength of the backdoor, doing so can significantly compromise its generality and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose UIBDiffusion, the universal imperceptible backdoor attack for diffusion models, which allows us to achieve superior attack and generation performance while evading state-of-the-art defenses. We propose a novel trigger generation approach based on universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and reveal that such perturbations, which are initially devised for fooling pre-trained discriminative models, can be adapted as potent imperceptible backdoor triggers for DMs. We evaluate UIBDiffusion on multiple types of DMs with different kinds of samplers across various datasets and targets. Experimental results demonstrate that UIBDiffusion brings three advantages: 1) Universality, the imperceptible trigger is universal (i.e., image and model agnostic) where a single trigger is effective to any images and all diffusion models with different samplers; 2) Utility, it achieves comparable generation quality (e.g., FID) and even better attack success rate (i.e., ASR) at low poison rates compared to the prior works; and 3) Undetectability, UIBDiffusion is plausible to human perception and can bypass Elijah and TERD, the SOTA defenses against backdoors for DMs. We will release our backdoor triggers and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Brouwer, Jan Erik van Woerden, Gertjan Burghouts, Matias Valdenegro-Toro, Marco Zullich</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot, fine-grained classification in computer vision poses significant challenges due to the need to differentiate subtle class distinctions with limited data. This paper presents a novel method that enhances the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model through adaptive prompt tuning, guided by real-time visual inputs. Unlike existing techniques such as Context Optimization (CoOp) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), which are constrained by static prompts or visual token reliance, the proposed approach leverages a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically refine text prompts for the image at hand. This enables an image-specific alignment of textual features with image patches extracted from the Vision Transformer, making the model more effective for datasets with high intra-class variance and low inter-class differences. The method is evaluated on several datasets, including CUBirds, Oxford Flowers, and FGVC Aircraft, showing significant performance gains over static prompt tuning approaches. To ensure these performance gains translate into trustworthy predictions, we integrate Monte-Carlo Dropout in our approach to improve the reliability of the model predictions and uncertainty estimates. This integration provides valuable insights into the model's predictive confidence, helping to identify when predictions can be trusted and when additional verification is necessary. This dynamic approach offers a robust solution, advancing the state-of-the-art for few-shot fine-grained classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni, Christian Marinoni, Emilian Postolache, Marco Comunit\`a, Luca Cosmo, Joshua D. Reiss, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Sound designers and Foley artists usually sonorize a scene, such as from a movie or video game, by manually annotating and sonorizing each action of interest in the video. In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning, yet their potential in finance remains underexplored due to the complexity and specialization of financial knowledge. In this work, we report the development of the Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain. Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. At the same time, Baichuan4-Finance demonstrates even more impressive performance on financial application scenarios, showcasing its potential to foster community innovation in the financial LLM field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Huang, Peili Mao, Ke Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern software systems are often highly configurable to tailor varied requirements from diverse stakeholders. Understanding the mapping between configurations and the desired performance attributes plays a fundamental role in advancing the controllability and tuning of the underlying system, yet has long been a dark hole of knowledge due to its black-box nature. While there have been previous efforts in performance analysis for these systems, they analyze the configurations as isolated data points without considering their inherent spatial relationships. This renders them incapable of interrogating many important aspects of the configuration space like local optima. In this work, we advocate a novel perspective to rethink performance analysis -- modeling the configuration space as a structured ``landscape''. To support this proposition, we designed \our, an open-source, graph data mining empowered fitness landscape analysis (FLA) framework. By applying this framework to $86$M benchmarked configurations from $32$ running workloads of $3$ real-world systems, we arrived at $6$ main findings, which together constitute a holistic picture of the landscape topography, with thorough discussions about their implications on both configuration tuning and performance modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxu Han, Zhenting Wang, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Cassidy, Marta Andronic, Samuel Coward, George A. Constantinides</p>
<p>Abstract: Lookup tables (LUTs) are frequently used to efficiently store arrays of precomputed values for complex mathematical computations. When used in the context of neural networks, these functions exhibit a lack of recognizable patterns which presents an unusual challenge for conventional logic synthesis techniques. Several approaches are known to break down a single large lookup table into multiple smaller ones that can be recombined. Traditional methods, such as plain tabulation, piecewise linear approximation, and multipartite table methods, often yield inefficient hardware solutions when applied to LUT-based NNs.
  This paper introduces ReducedLUT, a novel method to reduce the footprint of the LUTs by injecting don't cares into the compression process. This additional freedom introduces more self-similarities which can be exploited using known decomposition techniques. We then demonstrate a particular application to machine learning; by replacing unobserved patterns within the training data of neural network models with don't cares, we enable greater compression with minimal model accuracy degradation. In practice, we achieve up to $1.63\times$ reduction in Physical LUT utilization, with a test accuracy drop of no more than $0.01$ accuracy points.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study focuses on a method for detecting and classifying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, such as SYN Flooding, ACK Flooding, HTTP Flooding, and UDP Flooding, using neural networks. Machine learning, particularly neural networks, is highly effective in detecting malicious traffic. A dataset containing normal traffic and various DDoS attacks was used to train a neural network model with a 24-106-5 architecture. The model achieved high Accuracy (99.35%), Precision (99.32%), Recall (99.54%), and F-score (0.99) in the classification task. All major attack types were correctly identified. The model was also further tested in the lab using virtual infrastructures to generate normal and DDoS traffic. The results showed that the model can accurately classify attacks under near-real-world conditions, demonstrating 95.05% accuracy and balanced F-score scores for all attack types. This confirms that neural networks are an effective tool for detecting DDoS attacks in modern information security systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19111">Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-Anchor Guidance for Infrared-Visible Person Re-Identification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Ge, Zhihao Chen, Ziyang Wang, Jiaju Kang, Mingya Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of deep learning has facilitated the application of person re-identification (ReID) technology in intelligent security. Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrians across infrared and visible modality images enabling 24-hour surveillance. Current studies relying on unsupervised modality transformations as well as inefficient embedding constraints to bridge the spectral differences between infrared and visible images, however, limit their potential performance. To tackle the limitations of the above approaches, this paper introduces a simple yet effective Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-anchor Guidance Network, named SEPG-Net. Specifically, we propose a more homogeneous spectral enhancement scheme based on frequency domain information and greyscale space, which avoids the information loss typically caused by inefficient modality transformations. Further, a Pseudo Anchor-guided Bidirectional Aggregation (PABA) loss is introduced to bridge local modality discrepancies while better preserving discriminative identity embeddings. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEPG-Net against other state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a debiasing method for smooth nonparametric estimators. While machine learning techniques such as random forests and neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive performance, their theoretical properties remain relatively underexplored. Specifically, many modern algorithms lack assurances of pointwise asymptotic normality and uniform convergence, which are critical for statistical inference and robustness under covariate shift and have been well-established for classical methods like Nadaraya-Watson regression. To address this, we introduce a model-free debiasing method that guarantees these properties for smooth estimators derived from any nonparametric regression approach. By adding a correction term that estimates the conditional expected residual of the original estimator, or equivalently, its estimation error, we obtain a debiased estimator with proven pointwise asymptotic normality, and uniform convergence. These properties enable statistical inference and enhance robustness to covariate shift, making the method broadly applicable to a wide range of nonparametric regression problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an advanced mapping system that combines drone imagery with machine learning and computer vision to overcome challenges in speed, accuracy, and adaptability across diverse terrains. By automating processes like feature detection, image matching, and stitching, the system produces seamless, high-resolution maps with minimal latency, offering strategic advantages in defense operations. Developed in Python, the system utilizes OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for efficient computations, and Concurrent[dot]futures for parallel execution. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is employed for feature detection, while FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) ensures accurate keypoint matching. Homography transformations align overlapping images, resulting in distortion-free maps in real time. This automation eliminates manual intervention, enabling live updates essential in rapidly changing environments. Designed for versatility, the system performs reliably under various lighting conditions and rugged terrains, making it highly suitable for aerospace and defense applications. Testing has shown notable improvements in processing speed and accuracy compared to conventional methods, enhancing situational awareness and informed decision-making. This scalable solution leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide actionable, reliable data for mission-critical operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of conditional variance estimation and confidence interval construction in nonparametric regression using dense networks with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. We present a residual-based framework for conditional variance estimation, deriving nonasymptotic bounds for variance estimation under both heteroscedastic and homoscedastic settings. We relax the sub-Gaussian noise assumption, allowing the proposed bounds to accommodate sub-Exponential noise and beyond. Building on this, for a ReLU neural network estimator, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for both its conditional mean and variance estimation, representing the first result for variance estimation using ReLU networks. Furthermore, we develop a ReLU network based robust bootstrap procedure (Efron, 1992) for constructing confidence intervals for the true mean that comes with a theoretical guarantee on the coverage, providing a significant advancement in uncertainty quantification and the construction of reliable confidence intervals in deep learning settings.</p>
