<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix George, Harshit Kumar, Divya Pathak, Kaustabha Ray, Mudit Verma, Pratibha Moogi</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10651">Data Analysis and Performance Evaluation of Simulation Deduction Based on LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shansi Zhang, Min Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Arias Gonzalez, Steve DiPaola</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Desheng Kong, Xiangshuo Cui, Jiaying Jin, Jing Xu, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654">Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Mar\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10655">Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning II: Semantic Node Merging, Entailment Filtering, and Knowledge Graph Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Kiruluta, Priscilla Burity</p>
<p>Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Liu, Ning Xu, Junming Yang, Xin Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Zuo (ALMAnaCH), Kim Gerdes (LISN), Eric Villemonte de La Clergerie (ALMAnaCH), Beno\^it Sagot (ALMAnaCH)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikram Aggarwal, Jay Kulkarni, Aditi Mascarenhas, Aakriti Narang, Siddarth Raman, Ajay Shah, Susan Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Zhang, Muchen Li, Ziao Wang, Renjie Liao, Lele Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Longjohn, Shang Wu, Saatvik Kher, Catarina Bel\'em, Padhraic Smyth</p>
<p>Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxuan Xia, Qianye Wu, Hongbin Guan, Sixuan Tian, Yilun Hao, Xiaoyu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristina Pinneri, Christos Louizos</p>
<p>Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sichao Li, Xinyue Xu, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanlin Wang, Di Yuan, Shani Dettman, Dawn Choo, Emily Shimeng Xu, Denise Thomas, Maura E Ryan, Patrick C M Wong, Nancy M Young</p>
<p>Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Gao, Yazheng Yang, Zhibin Lan, Yidong Chen, Min Zhang, Daimeng Wei, Hui Huang, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Morbiato, Luca Romano, Alessandro Persona</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengxu Yang, Weitong Chen, Jack D. Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Cook, Kelly Patel, Sivapriya Vellaichamy, Saba Rahimi, Zhen Zeng, Sumitra Ganesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Jiang, Taihang Wang, Youzheng Liu, Yimin Wang, Yuhan Xia, Yunfei Long</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shien Zhu, Samuel Bohl, Robin Oester, Gustavo Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anupama Sitaraman, Bharathan Balaji, Yuvraj Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiago Machado, Maysa Malfiza Garcia de Macedo, Rogerio Abreu de Paula, Marcelo Carpinette Grave, Aminat Adebiyi, Luan Soares de Souza, Enrico Santarelli, Claudio Pinhanez</p>
<p>Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahang He, Rishi Ramachandran, Neel Ramachandran, Aryan Katakam, Kevin Zhu, Sunishchal Dev, Ashwinee Panda, Aryan Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Kattamuri, Arpita Vats, Harshwardhan Fartale, Rahul Raja, Akshata Kishore Moharir, Ishita Prasad</p>
<p>Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntu Zhao, Jialing Zhang, Chongxuan Li, Dequan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Chen, Wenjun Zhang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyal Rabin, Zohar Elyoseph, Rotem Israel-Fishelson, Adi Dali, Ravit Nussinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Following an instruction involves distinct sub-processes, such as reading content, reading the instruction, executing it, and producing an answer. We ask where, along the layer stack, instruction following begins, the point where reading gives way to doing. We introduce three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and two hop compositions of these tasks. Using activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs, we measure a layer-wise flip rate that indicates when substituting selected residual activations changes the predicted answer. Across models in the Llama family, we observe an inflection point, which we term onset, where interventions that change predictions before this point become largely ineffective afterward. Multi-hop compositions show a similar onset location. These results provide a simple, replicable way to locate where instruction following begins and to compare this location across tasks and model sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonghyeon Choi, Yeonjun Choi, Hyun-chul Kim, Beakcheol Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $\pi$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + \pi \log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $\pi$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce TEDxTN, the first publicly available Tunisian Arabic to English speech translation dataset. This work is in line with the ongoing effort to mitigate the data scarcity obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects. We collected, segmented, transcribed and translated 108 TEDx talks following our internally developed annotations guidelines. The collected talks represent 25 hours of speech with code-switching that cover speakers with various accents from over 11 different regions of Tunisia. We make the annotation guidelines and corpus publicly available. This will enable the extension of TEDxTN to new talks as they become available. We also report results for strong baseline systems of Speech Recognition and Speech Translation using multiple pre-trained and fine-tuned end-to-end models. This corpus is the first open source and publicly available speech translation corpus of Code-Switching Tunisian dialect. We believe that this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research on the natural language processing of Tunisian Dialect.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.</p>

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebecca Dorn, Christina Chance, Casandra Rusti, Charles Bickham Jr., Kai-Wei Chang, Fred Morstatter, Kristina Lerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Horoi, Sangwoo Cho, Supriyo Chakraborty, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Sambit Sahu, Guy Wolf, Genta Indra Winata</p>
<p>Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parisa Rabbani, Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10881">A Multifaceted Analysis of Negative Bias in Large Language Models through the Lens of Parametric Knowledge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongyoon Song, Sangwon Yu, Sungroh Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishant Mishra, Wilker Aziz, Iacer Calixto</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10899">From Proof to Program: Characterizing Tool-Induced Reasoning Hallucinations in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Farima Fatahi Bayat, Pouya Pezeshkpour, Estevam Hruschka</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueren Ge, Sahil Murtaza, Anthony Cortez, Homa Alemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating academic workflows, existing systems for academic peer review remain constrained by text-only inputs, limited contextual grounding, and a lack of actionable feedback. In this work, we present an interactive web-based system for multimodal, community-aware peer review simulation to enable effective manuscript revisions before paper submission. Our framework integrates textual and visual information through multimodal LLMs, enhances review quality via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounded in web-scale OpenReview data, and converts generated reviews into actionable to-do lists using the proposed Action:Objective[\#] format, providing structured and traceable guidance. The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramya Kumar, Dhruv Gulwani, Sonit Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across diverse domains, yet their performance on rare disease diagnosis from narrative medical cases remains underexplored. We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.</p>

This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aladin Djuhera, Farhan Ahmed, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Syed Zawad, Heiko Ludwig, Holger Boche</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Ren, Youran Sun, Haoyu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + \mu$, where $\mu$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $\sigma$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $\sigma$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $\sigma$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $\mu$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $\mu$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.</p>

We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Shi, Wenlong Meng, Zhenyuan Guo, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Rong, Yixin Zhang, Ziyi Wang, Deyang Jiang, Yunlong Zhao, Haoran Wu, Shiyu Zhou, Bo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udo Schlegel, Franziska Weeber, Jian Lan, Thomas Seidl</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a widely used multimodal model that aligns text and image representations through large-scale training. While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jooyoung Lee, Jader Martins Camboim de S\'a</p>
<p>Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jader Martins Camboim de S\'a, Jooyoung Lee, C\'edric Pruski, Marcos Da Silveira</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sania Nayab, Marco Simoni, Giulio Rossolini, Andrea Saracino</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Fan, JinYi Yoon, Bo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saadat Rafid Ahmed, Rubayet Shareen, Radoan Sharkar, Nazia Hossain, Mansur Mahi, Farig Yousuf Sadeque</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jawad Ibn Ahad, Muhammad Rafsan Kabir, Robin Krambroeckers, Sifat Momen, Nabeel Mohammed, Shafin Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility. We introduce NOVA, an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code. NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guilin Hu, Malek Itani, Tuochao Chen, Shyamnath Gollakota</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Ding, Yuhao Wang, Tengyue Xiao, Haoying Wang, Guojun Ma, Mingyang Wan, Caigui Jiang, Ning Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Hsuan Yang, Tanwi Mallick, Le Chen, Krishnan Raghavan, Azton Wells, Amal Gueroudji, Ian T. Foster, Rajeev Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhao, Hualei Zhu, Tingyu Jiang, Shen Li, Xiaohang Xu, Hao Henry Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runpeng Geng, Yanting Wang, Chenlong Yin, Minhao Cheng, Ying Chen, Jinyuan Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10788">From Efficiency to Adaptivity: A Deeper Look at Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Wu, Baoheng Li, Mingchen Gao, Zhenyi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elyes Hajji, Aymen Bouguerra, Fabio Arnez</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiechao Gao, Chang Liu, Yuangang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Crystal Min Hui Poon, Pai Chet Ng, Xiaoxiao Miao, Immanuel Jun Kai Loh, Bowen Zhang, Haoyu Song, Ian Mcloughlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-guided text-to-speech (TTS) research has reached a maturity level where excellent speech generation quality is possible on demand, yet two coupled biases persist: accent bias, where models default to dominant phonetic patterns, and linguistic bias, where dialect-specific lexical and cultural cues are ignored. These biases are interdependent, as authentic accent generation requires both accent fidelity and localized text. We present Contextual Linguistic Adaptation and Retrieval for Inclusive TTS sYnthesis (CLARITY), a backbone-agnostic framework that addresses these biases through dual-signal optimization: (i) contextual linguistic adaptation that localizes input text to the target dialect, and (ii) retrieval-augmented accent prompting (RAAP) that supplies accent-consistent speech prompts. Across twelve English accents, CLARITY improves accent accuracy and fairness while maintaining strong perceptual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayong Liang, Xiao-Yong Wei, Changmeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melika Behjati, James Henderson</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikel Robredo, Matteo Esposito, Davide Taibi, Rafael Pe\~naloza, Valentina Lenarduzzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Software quality research increasingly relies on large-scale datasets that measure both the product and process aspects of software systems. However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics. The dataset is publicly available on ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17566690).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sven Schultze, Meike Verena Kietzmann, Nils-Lucas Sch\"onfeld, Ruth Stock-Homburg</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing deployment of autonomous AI agents on the web is hampered by a fundamental misalignment: agents must infer affordances from human-oriented user interfaces, leading to brittle, inefficient, and insecure interactions. To address this, we introduce VOIX, a web-native framework that enables websites to expose reliable, auditable, and privacy-preserving capabilities for AI agents through simple, declarative HTML elements. VOIX introduces <tool> and <context> tags, allowing developers to explicitly define available actions and relevant state, thereby creating a clear, machine-readable contract for agent behavior. This approach shifts control to the website developer while preserving user privacy by disconnecting the conversational interactions from the website. We evaluated the framework's practicality, learnability, and expressiveness in a three-day hackathon study with 16 developers. The results demonstrate that participants, regardless of prior experience, were able to rapidly build diverse and functional agent-enabled web applications. Ultimately, this work provides a foundational mechanism for realizing the Agentic Web, enabling a future of seamless and secure human-AI collaboration on the web.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prabodh Katti, Sangwoo Park, Bipin Rajendran, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Massimo Rizzoli, Simone Alghisi, Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Giuseppe Riccardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dena Mujtaba, Brian Hu, Anthony Hoogs, Arslan Basharat</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangxuan Xiao, Junxian Guo, Kasra Mazaheri, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective solution for few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs). However, how LLMs leverage demonstrations to specify a task and learn a corresponding computational function through ICL is underexplored. Drawing from the way humans learn from content-label mappings in demonstrations, we categorize the tokens in an ICL prompt into content, stopword, and template tokens. Our goal is to identify the types of tokens whose representations directly influence LLM's performance, a property we refer to as being performance-critical. By ablating representations from the attention of the test example, we find that the representations of informative content tokens have less influence on performance compared to template and stopword tokens, which contrasts with the human attention to informative words. We give evidence that the representations of performance-critical tokens aggregate information from the content tokens. Moreover, we demonstrate experimentally that lexical meaning, repetition, and structural cues are the main distinguishing characteristics of these tokens. Our work sheds light on how large language models learn to perform tasks from demonstrations and deepens our understanding of the roles different types of tokens play in large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how explicit theoretical features are encoded in opaque neural systems is a central challenge now common to neuroscience and AI. We introduce Metric Learning Encoding Models (MLEMs) to address this challenge most directly as a metric learning problem: we fit the distance in the space of theoretical features to match the distance in neural space. Our framework improves on univariate encoding and decoding methods by building on second-order isomorphism methods, such as Representational Similarity Analysis, and extends them by learning a metric that efficiently models feature as well as interactions between them. The effectiveness of MLEM is validated through two sets of simulations. First, MLEMs recover ground-truth importance features in synthetic datasets better than state-of-the-art methods, such as Feature Reweighted RSA (FR-RSA). Second, we deploy MLEMs on real language data, where they show stronger robustness to noise in calculating the importance of linguistic features (gender, tense, etc.). MLEMs are applicable to any domains where theoretical features can be identified, such as language, vision, audition, etc. We release optimized code applicable to measure feature importance in the representations of any artificial neural networks or empirical neural data at https://github.com/LouisJalouzot/MLEM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jader Martins Camboim de S\'a, Marcos Da Silveira, C\'edric Pruski</p>
<p>Abstract: Live languages continuously evolve to integrate the cultural change of human societies. This evolution manifests through neologisms (new words) or \textbf{semantic changes} of words (new meaning to existing words). Understanding the meaning of words is vital for interpreting texts coming from different cultures (regionalism or slang), domains (e.g., technical terms), or periods. In computer science, these words are relevant to computational linguistics algorithms such as translation, information retrieval, question answering, etc. Semantic changes can potentially impact the quality of the outcomes of these algorithms. Therefore, it is important to understand and characterize these changes formally. The study of this impact is a recent problem that has attracted the attention of the computational linguistics community. Several approaches propose methods to detect semantic changes with good precision, but more effort is needed to characterize how the meaning of words changes and to reason about how to reduce the impact of semantic change. This survey provides an understandable overview of existing approaches to the \textit{characterization of semantic changes} and also formally defines three classes of characterizations: if the meaning of a word becomes more general or narrow (change in dimension) if the word is used in a more pejorative or positive/ameliorated sense (change in orientation), and if there is a trend to use the word in a, for instance, metaphoric or metonymic context (change in relation). We summarized the main aspects of the selected publications in a table and discussed the needs and trends in the research activities on semantic change characterization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE Transformers underperform vanilla Transformers in many downstream tasks, significantly diminishing the practical value of MoE models. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model are joint determinants of its downstream task performance. MoE models, in comparison to vanilla models, have poorer transfer capability, leading to their subpar performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models guided by vanilla models can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance in downstream tasks. We design a specific distillation method and conduct experiments on the BERT architecture. Experimental results show a significant improvement in downstream performance of MoE models, and many further evidences also strongly support the concept of transfer capability distillation. Finally, we attempt to interpret transfer capability distillation and provide some insights from the perspective of model feature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging the demonstration within the input context to adapt to new tasks. However, LLM is sensitive to the selection of demonstrations. To address the hallucination issue inherent in LLM, retrieval-augmented LLM (RAL) offers a solution by retrieving pertinent information from an established database. Nonetheless, existing research work lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented large language models on different biomedical NLP tasks. This deficiency makes it challenging to ascertain the capabilities of RAL within the biomedical domain. Moreover, the outputs from RAL are affected by retrieving the unlabeled, counterfactual, or diverse knowledge that is not well studied in the biomedical domain. However, such knowledge is common in the real world. Finally, exploring the self-awareness ability is also crucial for the RAL system. So, in this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of RALs on 5 different biomedical tasks (triple extraction, link prediction, classification, question answering, and natural language inference). We analyze the performance of RALs in four fundamental abilities, including unlabeled robustness, counterfactual robustness, diverse robustness, and negative awareness. To this end, we proposed an evaluation framework to assess the RALs' performance on different biomedical NLP tasks and establish four different testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities. Then, we evaluate 3 representative LLMs with 3 different retrievers on 5 tasks over 9 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Hofweber, Peter Hase, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Do norms of rationality apply to machine learning models, in particular language models? In this paper we investigate this question by focusing on a special subset of rational norms: coherence norms. We consider both logical coherence norms as well as coherence norms tied to the strength of belief. To make sense of the latter, we introduce the Minimal Assent Connection (MAC) and propose a new account of credence, which captures the strength of belief in language models. This proposal uniformly assigns strength of belief simply on the basis of model internal next token probabilities. We argue that rational norms tied to coherence do apply to some language models, but not to others. This issue is significant since rationality is closely tied to predicting and explaining behavior, and thus it is connected to considerations about AI safety and alignment, as well as understanding model behavior more generally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Schumacher, Fatemeh Haji, Tara Grey, Niharika Bandlamudi, Nupoor Karnik, Gagana Uday Kumar, Jason Cho-Yu Chiang, Paul Rad, Nishant Vishwamitra, Anthony Rios</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal question answering (TQA) remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when retrieved content may be irrelevant, outdated, or temporally inconsistent. This is especially critical in applications like clinical event ordering, and policy tracking, which require reliable temporal reasoning even under noisy or outdated information. To address this challenge, we introduce RASTeR: \textbf{R}obust, \textbf{A}gentic, and \textbf{S}tructured, \textbf{Te}mporal \textbf{R}easoning, a prompting framework that separates context evaluation from answer generation. RASTeR first assesses the relevance and temporal coherence of the retrieved context, then constructs a temporal knolwedge graph (TKG) to better facilitate reasoning. When inconsistencies are detected, RASTeR selectively corrects or discards context before generating an answer. Across multiple datasets and LLMs, RASTeR consistently improves robustness\footnote{\ Some TQA work defines robustness as handling diverse temporal phenomena. Here, we define it as the ability to answer correctly despite suboptimal context}. We further validate our approach through a ``needle-in-the-haystack'' study, in which relevant context is buried among distractors. With forty distractors, RASTeR achieves 75\% accuracy, over 12\% ahead of the runner up</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allison Keith, Antonio Rojas Castro, Hanno Ehrlicher, Kerstin Jung, Sebastian Pad\'o</p>
<p>Abstract: In theatre, playwrights use the portrayal of characters to explore culturally based gender norms. In this paper, we develop quantitative methods to study gender depiction in the non-religious works (comedias) of Pedro Calder\'on de la Barca, a prolific Spanish 17th century author. We gather insights from a corpus of more than 100 plays by using a gender classifier and applying model explainability (attribution) methods to determine which text features are most influential in the model's decision to classify speech as 'male' or 'female', indicating the most gendered elements of dialogue in Calder\'on's comedias in a human accessible manner. We find that female and male characters are portrayed differently and can be identified by the gender prediction model at practically useful accuracies (up to f=0.83). Analysis reveals semantic aspects of gender portrayal, and demonstrates that the model is even useful in providing a relatively accurate scene-by-scene prediction of cross-dressing characters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinu Nyachhyon, Mridul Sharma, Prajwal Thapa, Bal Krishna Bal</p>
<p>Abstract: The Nepali language has distinct linguistic features, especially its complex script (Devanagari script), morphology, and various dialects,which pose a unique challenge for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. While the Nepali Language Understanding Evaluation (Nep-gLUE) benchmark provides a foundation for evaluating models, it remains limited in scope, covering four tasks. This restricts their utility for comprehensive assessments of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. To address this limitation, we introduce twelve new datasets, creating a new benchmark, the Nepali /Language Understanding Evaluation (NLUE) benchmark for evaluating the performance of models across a diverse set of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. The added tasks include Single-Sentence Classification, Similarity and Paraphrase Tasks, Natural Language Inference (NLI), and General Masked Evaluation Task (GMET). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing top models struggle with the added complexity of these tasks. We also find that the best multilingual model outperforms the best monolingual models across most tasks, highlighting the need for more robust solutions tailored to the Nepali language. This expanded benchmark sets a new standard for evaluating, comparing, and advancing models, contributing significantly to the broader goal of advancing NLP research for low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruochen Li, Liqiang Jing, Chi Han, Jiawei Zhou, Xinya Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in automating the scientific research ideation. Existing approaches primarily focus on prompting techniques, often producing ideas misaligned with expert standards - novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, which are widely recognized by the research community as the three key subdimensions of high-quality ideas. Also, balancing these dimensions remains challenging due to their inherent trade-offs. To address these limitations, we propose the first framework that employs a two-stage approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the task. In the SFT stage, the model learns foundational patterns from pairs of research papers and their corresponding follow-up ideas. In the RL stage, multi-dimensional reward models guided by fine-grained feedback evaluate and optimize the model across key dimensions. During inference, dimensional controllers coordinated by a sentence-level decoder enable dynamic context-aware steering of the idea generation process. Our framework provides a balanced approach to research idea generation, achieving high-quality outcomes in the experiment by dynamically navigating the trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfeng Zhu, Hailong Jiang, Yulan Wang, Karin G. Coifman, Ruoming Jin, Deric R. Kenne</p>
<p>Abstract: Early substance use during adolescence increases the risk of later substance use disorders and mental health problems, yet the emotional and contextual factors driving these behaviors remain poorly understood. This study analyzed 23000 substance-use related posts and an equal number of non-substance posts from Reddit's r/teenagers community (2018-2022). Posts were annotated for six discrete emotions (sadness, anger, joy, guilt, fear, disgust) and contextual factors (family, peers, school) using large language models (LLMs). Statistical analyses compared group differences, and interpretable machine learning (SHAP) identified key predictors of substance-use discussions. LLM-assisted thematic coding further revealed latent psychosocial themes linking emotions with contexts. Negative emotions, especially sadness, guilt, fear, and disgust, were significantly more common in substance-use posts, while joy dominated non-substance discussions. Guilt and shame diverged in function: guilt often reflected regret and self-reflection, whereas shame reinforced risky behaviors through peer performance. Peer influence emerged as the strongest contextual factor, closely tied to sadness, fear, and guilt. Family and school environments acted as both risk and protective factors depending on relational quality and stress levels. Overall, adolescent substance-use discussions reflected a dynamic interplay of emotion, social context, and coping behavior. By integrating statistical analysis, interpretable models, and LLM-based thematic exploration, this study demonstrates the value of mixed computational approaches for uncovering the emotional and contextual mechanisms underlying adolescent risk behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on metaphor has steadily increased over the last decades, as this phenomenon opens a window into a range of linguistic and cognitive processes. At the same time, the demand for rigorously constructed and extensively normed experimental materials increased as well. Here, we present the Figurative Archive, an open database of 996 metaphors in Italian enriched with rating and corpus-based measures (from familiarity to semantic distance and preferred interpretations), derived by collecting stimuli used across 11 studies. It includes both everyday and literary metaphors, varying in structure and semantic domains, and is validated based on correlations between familiarity and other measures. The Archive has several aspects of novelty: it is increased in size compared to previous resources; it offers a measure of metaphor inclusiveness, to comply with recommendations for non-discriminatory language use; it is displayed in a web-based interface, with features for a customized consultation. We provide guidelines for using the Archive to source materials for studies investigating metaphor processing and relationships between metaphor features in humans and computational models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chart Question Answering (CQA) evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual understanding and reasoning over chart data. However, existing benchmarks mostly test surface-level parsing, such as reading labels and legends, while overlooking deeper scientific reasoning. We propose DomainCQA, a framework for constructing domain-specific CQA benchmarks that emphasize both visual comprehension and knowledge-intensive reasoning. It integrates complexity-aware chart selection, multitier QA generation, and expert validation. Applied to astronomy, DomainCQA yields AstroChart, a benchmark of 1,690 QA pairs over 482 charts, exposing persistent weaknesses in fine-grained perception, numerical reasoning, and domain knowledge integration across 21 MLLMs. Fine-tuning on AstroChart improves performance across fundamental and advanced tasks. Pilot QA sets in biochemistry, economics, medicine, and social science further demonstrate DomainCQA's generality. Together, our results establish DomainCQA as a unified pipeline for constructing and augmenting domain-specific chart reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wissam Antoun, Beno\^it Sagot, Djam\'e Seddah</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained transformer-encoder models like DeBERTaV3 and ModernBERT introduce architectural advancements aimed at improving efficiency and performance. Although the authors of ModernBERT report improved performance over DeBERTaV3 on several benchmarks, the lack of disclosed training data and the absence of comparisons using a shared dataset make it difficult to determine whether these gains are due to architectural improvements or differences in training data. In this work, we conduct a controlled study by pretraining ModernBERT on the same dataset as CamemBERTaV2, a DeBERTaV3 French model, isolating the effect of model design. Our results show that the previous model generation remains superior in sample efficiency and overall benchmark performance, with ModernBERT's primary advantage being its support for long context, faster training, and inference speed. However, the new proposed model still provides meaningful architectural improvements compared to earlier models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Additionally, we observe that high-quality pre-training data accelerates convergence but does not significantly improve final performance, suggesting potential benchmark saturation. These findings show the importance of disentangling pretraining data from architectural innovations when evaluating transformer models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Zechen Zhang, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can internalize new information and accurately internalize their implications to perform downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the information (news) is explicitly given as context, adequately integrating the information into model weights via fine-tuning remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce New News, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. First, we demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications, and Self-QA -- designed to distill the knowledge processed by the model with context into the weights of the model, which we term System-2 Fine-tuning (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the Self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news while preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we discover the contextual shadowing effect, where training with the news in context followed by its rephrases or QAs catastrophically degrades learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Yao, Shuqi Liu, Zehua Liu, Qintong Li, Mingyang Liu, Xiongwei Han, Zhijiang Guo, Han Wu, Linqi Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on reconciling the reasoning capabilities of System 2 with the efficiency of System 1. While existing training-based and prompt-based approaches face significant challenges in terms of efficiency and stability, model merging emerges as a promising strategy to integrate the diverse capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs) into a unified model. However, conventional model merging methods often assume uniform importance across layers, overlooking the functional heterogeneity inherent in neural components. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{A}ctivation-Guided \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{M}erging (\textbf{ACM}), a plug-and-play merging framework that determines layer-specific merging coefficients based on mutual information between activations of pre-trained and fine-tuned models. ACM effectively preserves task-specific capabilities without requiring gradient computations or additional training. Extensive experiments on Long-to-Short (L2S) and general merging tasks demonstrate that ACM consistently outperforms all baseline methods. For instance, in the case of Qwen-7B models, TIES-Merging equipped with ACM achieves a \textbf{55.3\%} reduction in response length while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy by \textbf{1.3} points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaru Zou, Yikun Ban, Zihao Li, Yunzhe Qi, Ruizhong Qiu, Ling Yang, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keshav Ramji, Tahira Naseem, Ram\'on Fernandez Astudillo</p>
<p>Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes that guide model reasoning toward human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ a form of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains that our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Liu, Mayi Xu, Qiankun Pi, Wenli Li, Ming Zhong, Yuanyuan Zhu, Mengchi Liu, Tieyun Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including texts, tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Yet it remains unclear whether such biases are systematic, which data-level factors drive them, and what internal mechanisms underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of format bias in LLMs through a three-stage empirical analysis. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage examines how key data-level factors influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its effectiveness. Our results show that format bias is consistent across model families, driven by information richness, structure quality, and representation type, and is closely associated with attention imbalance within the LLMs. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: enhancing data pre-processing through format repair and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015 through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shariar Kabir, Kevin Esterling, Yue Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) display recognizable political leanings, yet they vary significantly in their ability to represent a political orientation consistently. In this paper, we define ideological depth as (i) a model's ability to follow political instructions without failure (steerability), and (ii) the feature richness of its internal political representations measured with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), an unsupervised sparse dictionary learning (SDL) approach. Using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-IT as candidates, we compare prompt-based and activation-steering interventions and probe political features with publicly available SAEs. We find large, systematic differences: Gemma is more steerable in both directions and activates approximately 7.3x more distinct political features than Llama. Furthermore, causal ablations of a small targeted set of Gemma's political features to create a similar feature-poor setting induce consistent shifts in its behavior, with increased rates of refusals across topics. Together, these results indicate that refusals on benign political instructions or prompts can arise from capability deficits rather than safety guardrails. Ideological depth thus emerges as a measurable property of LLMs, and steerability serves as a window into their latent political architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taihei Sone</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS), a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index (PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and social media.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederic Kirstein, Sonu Kumar, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: Meeting summarization with large language models (LLMs) remains error-prone, often producing outputs with hallucinations, omissions, and irrelevancies. We present FRAME, a modular pipeline that reframes summarization as a semantic enrichment task. FRAME extracts and scores salient facts, organizes them thematically, and uses these to enrich an outline into an abstractive summary. To personalize summaries, we introduce SCOPE, a reason-out-loud protocol that has the model build a reasoning trace by answering nine questions before content selection. For evaluation, we propose P-MESA, a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework to assess if a summary fits a target reader. P-MESA reliably identifies error instances, achieving >= 89% balanced accuracy against human annotations and strongly aligns with human severity ratings (r >= 0.70). On QMSum and FAME, FRAME reduces hallucination and omission by 2 out of 5 points (measured with MESA), while SCOPE improves knowledge fit and goal alignment over prompt-only baselines. Our findings advocate for rethinking summarization to improve control, faithfulness, and personalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakir Hasan, Shubhashis Roy Dipta</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects. BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect, developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of 24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakib Yazdani, Yasser Hamidullah, Cristina Espa\~na-Bonet, Eleftherios Avramidis, Josef van Genabith</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models (LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Canhui Wu, Qiong Cao, Chao Xue, Wei Xi, Xiaodong He</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF} (\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs, enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyan Zheng, Herun Wan, Minnan Luo, Junhang Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing social bot detectors perform well on benchmarks, their robustness across diverse real-world scenarios remains limited due to unclear ground truth and varied misleading cues. In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\% under shortcut scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hearing-impaired individuals often face significant barriers in daily communication due to the inherent challenges of producing clear speech. To address this, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To address the distinctive pronunciation patterns of hearing-impaired speech and the limited adaptability of existing models, we develop a multimodal preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively evaluates sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. Architecturally, we employs a novel unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode the lip dynamics, which is critical for accurate interpretation. Experiments on purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. Our work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifeng Cai, Hao Liang, Chang Xu, Tao Xie, Wentao Zhang, Bin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixiang Jiang, Lingbo Liu, Changwen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the demonstrated parameter efficiency of prompt-based fusion, its limited adaptivity and expressiveness hinder its effectiveness for multimodal applications at scale. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study addressing these limitations. Our key motivation is to ``divide and conquer'' the vanilla prompt, traditionally shared across all instances, by generating instance-specific prompts. Specifically, we propose the Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE), a framework that significantly enhances prompt adaptivity and expressiveness by dynamically generating instance-specific prompts. MoPE leverages multimodal pairings as additional evidence, allowing the model to adaptively select optimal prompts tailored to each individual instance. Unlike traditional prompt-fusion methods, which encounter scalability bottlenecks when optimizing long unified prompts, MoPE maintains fixed prompt length while effectively scaling the number of specialized experts. Moreover, we investigate regularization terms to encourage expert specialization, resulting in highly adaptive and interpretable prompting. MoPE fundamentally changes the scaling dynamic, unlocking greater expressiveness and adaptability to complex multimodal relationships, enabling the model to selectively attend to task-relevant sub-sequences based on instance-specific multimodal input. Extensive experiments across six multimodal datasets spanning four modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for multimodal fusion, matching or surpassing the performance of fine-tuning while requiring only 0.8% of the trainable parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Storytelling video generation (SVG) aims to produce coherent and visually rich multi-scene videos that follow a structured narrative. Existing methods primarily employ LLM for high-level planning to decompose a story into scene-level descriptions, which are then independently generated and stitched together. However, these approaches struggle with generating high-quality videos aligned with the complex single-scene description, as visualizing such complex description involves coherent composition of multiple characters and events, complex motion synthesis and multi-character customization. To address these challenges, we propose DREAMRUNNER, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout planning. Next, DREAMRUNNER presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel spatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for fine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame spatial-temporal semantic control. We compare DREAMRUNNER with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions. Additionally, DREAMRUNNER exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following ability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming baselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DREAMRUNNER's robust ability to generate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Shivanshu Shekhar, Boyao Wang, Shizhe Diao, Jipeng Zhang, Xingyuan Pan, Renjie Pi, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings enables privacy-preserving adaptation but suffers from cross-client interference due to model aggregation. Existing federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, primarily based on FedAvg, struggle with data heterogeneity, leading to harmful cross-client interference and suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedALT}, a novel personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning algorithm that fundamentally departs from FedAvg. Instead of using an aggregated model to initialize local training, each client continues training its individual LoRA while incorporating shared knowledge through a separate Rest-of-World (RoW) LoRA component. To effectively balance local adaptation and global information, FedALT introduces an adaptive mixer that dynamically learns input-specific weightings between the individual and RoW LoRA components, drawing conceptual foundations from the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm. Through extensive experiments on NLP benchmarks, we demonstrate that FedALT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, achieving superior local adaptation without sacrificing computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqing He, Zhibo Wang, Huiyu Xu, Hejun Lin, Wenhui Zhang, Zhixuan Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities in generation tasks but are prone to producing harmful, misleading, or biased content, posing significant ethical and safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, representation engineering, which steer model behavior toward desired attributes by injecting carefully designed steering vectors into LLM's representations at inference time, has emerged as a promising alternative to fine-tuning approaches. However, due to the semantically entangled nature of LLM's representation, existing representation engineering methods still suffer from several limitations: limited fine-grained controllability, content quality degradation, and conflict in multi-attribute control. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sparse Representation Steering (SRS), a novel framework that achieves fine-grained and interpretable control over LLM behavior by first disentangling internal activations into a sparse, semantically meaningful representation space, and then selectively steering relevant dimensions. Specifically, SRS leverages a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to transform dense, entangled activation patterns into a sparse monosemantic feature space. To identify relevant features, SRS contrasts sparse activations from positive and negative prompt pairs and measures their bidirectional KL divergence to locate dimensions most associated with the target attribute. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Gemma-2 series model across three alignment dimensions, i.e., safety, fairness, and truthfulness, to evaluate the effectiveness of SRS. Results show that SRS consistently outperforms existing steering methods, which achieves significantly improved controllability across both single and multiple attribute settings, while preserving high linguistic quality and general ability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools, making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Zheng, Haotong Qin, Yuye Li, Haoran Chu, Jiakai Wang, Jinyang Guo, Michele Magno, Xianglong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by performing a first-order Taylor expansion around the pre-quantization weights. This yields an approximation based on the difference between latent and full-precision weights as well as the Hessian matrix. When substituted into the theoretical solution, the formulation eliminates the need to explicitly compute the Hessian, thereby avoiding the high computational cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient methods. This design introduces only minimal additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 17.3% and increases the 5-shot MMLU accuracy from 53.8% achieved by GPTAQ to 56.1%. Moreover, FOEM can be seamlessly combined with advanced techniques such as SpinQuant, delivering additional gains under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting and further narrowing the performance gap with full-precision baselines, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuqiang Zheng, Yiyan Xu, Xinyu Lin, Chongming Gao, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379">Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ofir Azachi, Kfir Eliyahu, Eyal El Ani, Rom Himelstein, Roi Reichart, Yuval Pinter, Nitay Calderon</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Li, Zhicai Wang, Yuan Sheng, Xingyu Zhu, Yanbin Hao, Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soufiane Essahli, Oussama Sarsar, Ahmed Bentajer, Anas Motii, Imane Fouad</p>
<p>Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenization, Transformer inference, and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal data leaves the device. FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum: baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss, adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantization. Evaluated on a dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1% macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to 14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest performance loss. By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10067">Enhancing the Medical Context-Awareness Ability of LLMs via Multifaceted Self-Refinement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhou, Yubin Wang, Bin Wang, Chen Ning, Xien Liu, Ji Wu, Jianye Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).
