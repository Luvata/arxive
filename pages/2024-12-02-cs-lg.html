<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Zubair Khan, David Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to binary classification using dynamic logistic ensemble models. The proposed method addresses the challenges posed by datasets containing inherent internal clusters that lack explicit feature-based separations. By extending traditional logistic regression, we develop an algorithm that automatically partitions the dataset into multiple subsets, constructing an ensemble of logistic models to enhance classification accuracy. A key innovation in this work is the recursive probability calculation, derived through algebraic manipulation and mathematical induction, which enables scalable and efficient model construction. Compared to traditional ensemble methods such as Bagging and Boosting, our approach maintains interpretability while offering competitive performance. Furthermore, we systematically employ maximum likelihood and cost functions to facilitate the analytical derivation of recursive gradients as functions of ensemble depth. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on a custom dataset created by introducing noise and shifting data to simulate group structures, resulting in significant performance improvements with layers. Implemented in Python, this work balances computational efficiency with theoretical rigor, providing a robust and interpretable solution for complex classification tasks with broad implications for machine learning applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Morales-Brotons, Thijs Vogels, Hadrien Hendrikx</p>
<p>Abstract: Weight averaging of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) iterates is a popular method for training deep learning models. While it is often used as part of complex training pipelines to improve generalization or serve as a `teacher' model, weight averaging lacks proper evaluation on its own. In this work, we present a systematic study of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of weights. We first explore the training dynamics of EMA, give guidelines for hyperparameter tuning, and highlight its good early performance, partly explaining its success as a teacher. We also observe that EMA requires less learning rate decay compared to SGD since averaging naturally reduces noise, introducing a form of implicit regularization. Through extensive experiments, we show that EMA solutions differ from last-iterate solutions. EMA models not only generalize better but also exhibit improved i) robustness to noisy labels, ii) prediction consistency, iii) calibration and iv) transfer learning. Therefore, we suggest that an EMA of weights is a simple yet effective plug-in to improve the performance of deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiong Wang, Maria Paskevich, Hui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The mobile gaming industry, particularly the free-to-play sector, has been around for more than a decade, yet it still experiences rapid growth. The concept of games-as-service requires game developers to pay much more attention to recommendations of content in their games. With recommender systems (RS), the inevitable problem of bias in the data comes hand in hand. A lot of research has been done on the case of bias in RS for online retail or services, but much less is available for the specific case of the game industry. Also, in previous works, various debiasing techniques were tested on explicit feedback datasets, while it is much more common in mobile gaming data to only have implicit feedback. This case study aims to identify and categorize potential bias within datasets specific to model-based recommendations in mobile games, review debiasing techniques in the existing literature, and assess their effectiveness on real-world data gathered through implicit feedback. The effectiveness of these methods is then evaluated based on their debiasing quality, data requirements, and computational demands.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrey Ganatra, Spandan Anaokar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: Have you ever considered the sheer volume of actions we perform using IoT (Internet of Things) devices within our homes, offices, and daily environments? From the mundane act of flicking a light switch to the precise adjustment of room temperatures, we are surrounded by a wealth of data, each representing a glimpse into user behaviour. While existing research has sought to decipher user behaviours from these interactions and their timestamps, a critical dimension still needs to be explored: the timing of these actions. Despite extensive efforts to understand and forecast user behaviours, the temporal dimension of these interactions has received scant attention. However, the timing of actions holds profound implications for user experience, efficiency, and overall satisfaction with intelligent systems. In our paper, we venture into the less-explored realm of human-centric AI by endeavoring to predict user actions and their timing. To achieve this, we contribute a meticulously synthesized dataset comprising 11k sequences of actions paired with their respective date and time stamps. Building upon this dataset, we propose our model, which employs advanced machine learning techniques for k-class classification over time intervals within a day. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at time prediction for smart homes. We achieve a 40% (96-class) accuracy across all datasets and an 80% (8-class) accuracy on the dataset containing exact timestamps, showcasing the efficacy of our approach in predicting the temporal dynamics of user actions within smart environments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18729">Multi-Task Model Merging via Adaptive Weight Disentanglement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Xiong, Runxi Cheng, Wang Chen, Zhanqiu Zhang, Yiwen Guo, Chun Yuan, Ruifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention as an efficient and effective technique for integrating task-specific weights from various tasks into a unified multi-task model without retraining or additional data. As a representative approach, Task Arithmetic (TA) has demonstrated that combining task vectors through arithmetic operations facilitates efficient capability transfer between different tasks. In this framework, task vectors are obtained by subtracting the parameter values of a pre-trained model from those of individually fine-tuned models initialized from it. Despite the notable effectiveness of TA, interference among task vectors can adversely affect the performance of the merged model. In this paper, we relax the constraints of Task Arithmetic Property and propose Task Consistency Property, which can be regarded as being free from task interference. Through theoretical derivation, we show that such a property can be approximately achieved by seeking orthogonal task vectors. Guiding by this insight, we propose Adaptive Weight Disentanglement (AWD), which decomposes traditional task vectors into a redundant vector and several disentangled task vectors. The primary optimization objective of AWD is to achieve orthogonality among the disentangled task vectors, thereby closely approximating the desired solution. Notably, these disentangled task vectors can be seamlessly integrated into existing merging methodologies. Experimental results demonstrate that our AWD consistently and significantly improves upon previous merging approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magdalini Paschali, Zhihong Chen, Louis Blankemeier, Maya Varma, Alaa Youssef, Christian Bluethgen, Curtis Langlotz, Sergios Gatidis, Akshay Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have witnessed the emergence of large-scale deep learning models capable of interpreting and generating both textual and imaging data. Such models, typically referred to as foundation models, are trained on extensive corpora of unlabeled data and demonstrate high performance across various tasks. Foundation models have recently received extensive attention from academic, industry, and regulatory bodies. Given the potentially transformative impact that foundation models can have on the field of radiology, this review aims to establish a standardized terminology concerning foundation models, with a specific focus on the requirements of training data, model training paradigms, model capabilities, and evaluation strategies. We further outline potential pathways to facilitate the training of radiology-specific foundation models, with a critical emphasis on elucidating both the benefits and challenges associated with such models. Overall, we envision that this review can unify technical advances and clinical needs in the training of foundation models for radiology in a safe and responsible manner, for ultimately benefiting patients, providers, and radiologists.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaojiao Zhang, Linglingzhi Zhu, Dominik Fay, Mikael Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a locally differentially private (LDP) algorithm for online federated learning that employs temporally correlated noise to improve utility while preserving privacy. To address challenges posed by the correlated noise and local updates with streaming non-IID data, we develop a perturbed iterate analysis that controls the impact of the noise on the utility. Moreover, we demonstrate how the drift errors from local updates can be effectively managed for several classes of nonconvex loss functions. Subject to an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP budget, we establish a dynamic regret bound that quantifies the impact of key parameters and the intensity of changes in the dynamic environment on the learning performance. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqiu You, Youngja Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the attack patterns associated with a cyberattack is crucial for comprehending the attacker's behaviors and implementing the right mitigation measures. However, majority of the information regarding new attacks is typically presented in unstructured text, posing significant challenges for security analysts in collecting necessary information. In this paper, we present a sentence classification system that can identify the attack techniques described in natural language sentences from cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. We propose a new method for utilizing auxiliary data with the same labels to improve classification for the low-resource cyberattack classification task. The system first trains the model using the augmented training data and then trains more using only the primary data. We validate our model using the TRAM data1 and the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Experiments show that our method enhances Macro-F1 by 5 to 9 percentage points and keeps Micro-F1 scores competitive when compared to the baseline performance on the TRAM dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dheeman Saha, Aaron Segura, Biraj Tiwari</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing large datasets and summarizing it into useful information is the heart of the data mining process. In healthcare, information can be converted into knowledge about patient historical patterns and possible future trends. During the COVID-19 pandemic, data mining COVID-19 patient information poses an opportunity to discover patterns that may signal that the patient is at high risk for death. COVID-19 patients die from sepsis, a complex disease process involving multiple organ systems. We extracted the variables physicians are most concerned about regarding viral septic infections. With the aim of distinguishing COVID-19 patients who survive their hospital stay and those COVID-19 who do not, the authors of this study utilize the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Random Forest (RF) classification techniques to classify patients according to their demographics, laboratory test results, and preexisting health conditions. After conducting a 10-fold validation procedure, we assessed the performance of the classification through a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and a Confusion Matrix was used to determine the accuracy of the classifiers. We also performed a cluster analysis on the binary factors, such as if the patient had a preexisting condition and if sepsis was identified, and the numeric values from patient demographics and laboratory test results as predictors.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18788">Investigating Plausibility of Biologically Inspired Bayesian Learning in ANNs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ram Zaveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has been the leading issue in the domain of lifelong learning in artificial systems. Current artificial systems are reasonably good at learning domains they have seen before; however, as soon as they encounter something new, they either go through a significant performance deterioration or if you try to teach them the new distribution of data, they forget what they have learned before. Additionally, they are also prone to being overly confident when performing inference on seen as well as unseen data, causing significant reliability issues when lives are at stake. Therefore, it is extremely important to dig into this problem and formulate an approach that will be continually adaptable as well as reliable. If we move away from the engineering domain of such systems and look into biological systems, we can realize that these very systems are very efficient at computing the reliance as well as the uncertainty of accurate predictions that further help them refine the inference in a life-long setting. These systems are not perfect; however, they do give us a solid understanding of the reasoning under uncertainty which takes us to the domain of Bayesian reasoning. We incorporate this Bayesian inference with thresholding mechanism as to mimic more biologically inspired models, but only at spatial level. Further, we reproduce a recent study on Bayesian Inference with Spiking Neural Networks for Continual Learning to compare against it as a suitable biologically inspired Bayesian framework. Overall, we investigate the plausibility of biologically inspired Bayesian Learning in artificial systems on a vision dataset, MNIST, and show relative performance improvement under the conditions when the model is forced to predict VS when the model is not.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Khalid, Fadeel Sher Khan, John Broussard, Arko Barman</p>
<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis and discovery of therapeutic drug targets are crucial objectives for the effective management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Current approaches for AD diagnosis and treatment planning are based on radiological imaging and largely inaccessible for population-level screening due to prohibitive costs and limited availability. Recently, blood tests have shown promise in diagnosing AD and highlighting possible biomarkers that can be used as drug targets for AD management. Blood tests are significantly more accessible to disadvantaged populations, cost-effective, and minimally invasive. However, biomarker discovery in the context of AD diagnosis is complex as there exist important associations between various biomarkers. Here, we introduce BRAIN (Biomarker Representation, Analysis, and Interpretation Network), a novel machine learning (ML) framework to jointly optimize the diagnostic accuracy and biomarker discovery processes to identify all relevant biomarkers that contribute to AD diagnosis. Using a holistic graph-based representation for biomarkers, we highlight their inter-dependencies and explain why different ML models identify different discriminative biomarkers. We apply BRAIN to a publicly available blood biomarker dataset, revealing three novel biomarker sub-networks whose interactions vary between the control and AD groups, offering a new paradigm for drug discovery and biomarker analysis for AD.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18797">UOE: Unlearning One Expert Is Enough For Mixture-of-experts LLMS</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Zhuang, Yihua Zhang, Kehan Guo, Jinghan Jia, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. However, despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have received little attention and remain largely unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance and highly efficient inference processes, we ask: How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? And will traditional unlearning methods be applicable to MoE architectures? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. Specifically, unlearning disrupts the router's expert selection, causing significant selection shift from the most unlearning target-related experts to irrelevant ones. As a result, more experts than necessary are affected, leading to excessive forgetting and loss of control over which knowledge is erased. To address this, we propose a novel single-expert unlearning framework, referred to as UOE, for MoE LLMs. Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged expert for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning that preserves model utility. The proposed UOE framework is also compatible with various unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UOE enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks, LLM architectures, while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Sietsema, Zerrin Vural, James Chapman, Yotam Yaniv, Deanna Needell</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) decompose non-negative high-dimensional data into non-negative low-rank components. NMF and NTF methods are popular for their intrinsic interpretability and effectiveness on large-scale data. Recent work developed Stratified-NMF, which applies NMF to regimes where data may come from different sources (strata) with different underlying distributions, and seeks to recover both strata-dependent information and global topics shared across strata. Applying Stratified-NMF to multi-modal data requires flattening across modes, and therefore loses geometric structure contained implicitly within the tensor. To address this problem, we extend Stratified-NMF to the tensor setting by developing a multiplicative update rule and demonstrating the method on text and image data. We find that Stratified-NTF can identify interpretable topics with lower memory requirements than Stratified-NMF. We also introduce a regularized version of the method and demonstrate its effects on image data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Martin Xavier, Ludovic Chamoin, Jawher Jerray, Laurent Fribourg</p>
<p>Abstract: The early stopping strategy consists in stopping the training process of a neural network (NN) on a set $S$ of input data before training error is minimal. The advantage is that the NN then retains good generalization properties, i.e. it gives good predictions on data outside $S$, and a good estimate of the statistical error (``population loss'') is obtained. We give here an analytical estimation of the optimal stopping time involving basically the initial training error vector and the eigenvalues of the ``neural tangent kernel''. This yields an upper bound on the population loss which is well-suited to the underparameterized context (where the number of parameters is moderate compared with the number of data). Our method is illustrated on the example of an NN simulating the MPC control of a Van der Pol oscillator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roozbeh Yousefzadeh, Xuenan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Using AI to write formal proofs for mathematical problems is a challenging task that has seen some advancements in recent years. Automated systems such as Lean can verify the correctness of proofs written in formal language, yet writing the proofs in formal language can be challenging for humans and machines. The miniF2F benchmark has 20 IMO problems in its testing set, yet formal proofs are available only for 7 of these problems (3 of which are written only by mathematicians). The model with best accuracy can only prove 4 of these 20 IMO problems, from 1950s and 60s, while its training set is a secret. In this work, we write complete, original formal proofs for the remaining 13 IMO problems in Lean along with 3 extra problems from IMO 2022 and 2023. This effort expands the availability of proof currently in the public domain by creating 5,150 lines of Lean proof. The goal of the paper is to pave the way for developing AI models that can automatically write the formal proofs for all the IMO problems in miniF2F and beyond. In this pursuit, we devise a method to decompose the proof of these problems into their building blocks, constructing a dataset of about 900 lemmas with 25,500 lines of Lean code. These lemmas are not trivial, yet they are approachable, providing the opportunity to evaluate and diagnose the failures and successes of AI models. We then evaluate the ability of GPT-4 in writing formal proofs for these lemmas with zero shot prompting, CoT reasoning and lemma retrieval. In evaluating the responses, we also analyze the confounding factor of LLM's ability to write the proofs in natural language vs Lean language.</p>

To bridge this gap, we evaluate nine SI algorithms-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cuckoo Search, Bat Algorithm, Bee Colony, Ant Colony Optimization, Fish Swarm, Glow Worm, and Intelligent Water Droplet-across four experimental scenarios: fixed client participation, dynamic participation patterns, hetergeneous non-IID data distributions, and adversarial noise conditions. Results indicate that GWO exhibits superior adaptability and robustness, achieving the highest accuracy, recall and F1-scoress across all configurations, while PSO and Cuckoo Search also demonstrate strong performance. These findings underscore the potential of SI algorithms to address decentralized and adversarial FL challenges, offereing scalable and resilient solutions for cybersecurity applications, including intrusion detection in IoT and large-scale networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Karvonen, Can Rager, Samuel Marks, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are an interpretability technique aimed at decomposing neural network activations into interpretable units. However, a major bottleneck for SAE development has been the lack of high-quality performance metrics, with prior work largely relying on unsupervised proxies. In this work, we introduce a family of evaluations based on SHIFT, a downstream task from Marks et al. (Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> De Li, Haodong Qian, Qiyu Li, Zhou Tan, Zemin Gan, Jinyan Wang, Xianxian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm based on graph neural networks, enabling secure and collaborative modeling of local graph data among clients. However, label noise can degrade the global model's generalization performance. Existing federated label noise learning methods, primarily focused on computer vision, often yield suboptimal results when applied to FGL. To address this, we propose a robust federated graph learning method with label noise, termed FedRGL. FedRGL introduces dual-perspective consistency noise node filtering, leveraging both the global model and subgraph structure under class-aware dynamic thresholds. To enhance client-side training, we incorporate graph contrastive learning, which improves encoder robustness and assigns high-confidence pseudo-labels to noisy nodes. Additionally, we measure model quality via predictive entropy of unlabeled nodes, enabling adaptive robust aggregation of the global model. Comparative experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedRGL outperforms 12 baseline methods across various noise rates, types, and numbers of clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnou Vinayagame, Gregory Senay, Luis Mart\'i</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical reasoning capabilities are increasing with tool-augmented language agents, but methods often rely either on closed-source or large models, external data, or extensive prompt engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel cost-effective method to train LLM agents for tabular data problems through reasoning, planning, and tool use. With a progressive self-improvement paradigm and an iterative weak supervision, it empowers 3.8B/8B Small Language Models (SLMs), particularly suited for local hosting and sensitive business contexts where data privacy is crucial. By employing a flexible and reusable tools across different datasets, it achieves robust performance with effective scalability across shared tasks. Experiments show that MATATA reaches state-of-the-art performances on FinQA and TAT-QA among reasoning frameworks based on open-source models. Moreover, MATATA models compete with GPT-4 based frameworks on TabMWP, while being SLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18919">Federated Continual Graph Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinlin Zhu, Xunkai Li, Miao Hu, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of big data, managing evolving graph data poses substantial challenges due to storage costs and privacy issues. Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such evolving data usually causes catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they predominantly operate in centralized architectures and overlook the potential of distributed graph databases to harness collective intelligence for enhanced performance optimization. To address these challenges, we present a pioneering study on Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL), which adapts GNNs to multiple evolving graphs within decentralized settings while adhering to storage and privacy constraints. Our work begins with a comprehensive empirical analysis of FCGL, assessing its data characteristics, feasibility, and effectiveness, and reveals two principal challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where local GNNs forget prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To tackle these, we propose the POWER framework, which mitigates LGF by preserving and replaying experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage at each client and addresses GEC by using a pseudo prototype reconstruction strategy and trajectory-aware knowledge transfer at the central server. Extensive evaluations across multiple graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superior performance over straightforward federated extensions of the centralized CGL algorithms and vision-focused federated continual learning algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Al Ghossein, Emile Contal, Alexandre Robicquet</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform new tasks by conditioning on prompts with relevant information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances ICL by incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM's context at query time. However, traditional retrieval methods focus on semantic relevance, treating retrieval as a search problem. In this paper, we propose reframing retrieval for ICL as a recommendation problem, aiming to select documents that maximize utility in ICL tasks. We introduce the In-Context Learning Embedding and Reranker Benchmark (ICLERB), a novel evaluation framework that compares retrievers based on their ability to enhance LLM accuracy in ICL settings. Additionally, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning-to-Rank from AI Feedback (RLRAIF) algorithm, designed to fine-tune retrieval models using minimal feedback from the LLM. Our experimental results reveal notable differences between ICLERB and existing benchmarks, and demonstrate that small models fine-tuned with our RLRAIF algorithm outperform large state-of-the-art retrieval models. These findings highlight the limitations of existing evaluation methods and the need for specialized benchmarks and training strategies adapted to ICL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaomin Wang, Chaolong Ying, Xiaodong Luo, Tianshu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninnart Fuengfusin, Hakaru Tamukoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have enabled smart applications on hardware devices. However, these hardware devices are vulnerable to unintended faults caused by aging, temperature variance, and write errors. These faults can cause bit-flips in DNN weights and significantly degrade the performance of DNNs. Thus, protection against these faults is crucial for the deployment of DNNs in critical applications. Previous works have proposed error correction codes based methods, however these methods often require high overheads in both memory and computation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to harden DNN weights by multiplying weights by constants before storing them to fault-prone medium. When used, these weights are divided back by the same constants to restore the original scale. Our method is based on the observation that errors from bit-flips have properties similar to additive noise, therefore by dividing by constants can reduce the absolute error from bit-flips. To demonstrate our method, we conduct experiments across four ImageNet 2012 pre-trained models along with three different data types: 32-bit floating point, 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point. This method demonstrates that by only multiplying weights with constants, Top-1 Accuracy of 8-bit fixed point ResNet50 is improved by 54.418 at bit-error rate of 0.0001.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atchutaram K. Kocharlakota, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, Robert W. Heath Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based downlink power control in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems offers a promising alternative to conventional iterative optimization algorithms, which are computationally intensive due to online iterative steps. Existing learning-based methods, however, often fail to exploit the intrinsic structure of channel data and neglect pilot allocation information, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in large-scale networks with many users. This paper introduces the pilot contamination-aware power control (PAPC) transformer neural network, a novel approach that integrates pilot allocation data into the network, effectively handling pilot contamination scenarios. PAPC employs the attention mechanism with a custom masking technique to utilize structural information and pilot data. The architecture includes tailored preprocessing and post-processing stages for efficient feature extraction and adherence to power constraints. Trained in an unsupervised learning framework, PAPC is evaluated against the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm, showing comparable spectral efficiency fairness performance while significantly improving computational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate PAPC's superior performance over fully connected networks (FCNs) that lack pilot information, its scalability to large-scale CFmMIMO networks, and its computational efficiency improvement over APG. Additionally, by employing padding techniques, PAPC adapts to the dynamically varying number of users without retraining.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19027">Enhancing Neural Network Robustness Against Fault Injection Through Non-linear Weight Transformations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ninnart Fuengfusin, Hakaru Tamukoh</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world environments poses challenges due to faults that can manifest in physical hardware from radiation, aging, and temperature fluctuations. To address this, previous works have focused on protecting DNNs via activation range restriction using clipped ReLU and finding the optimal clipping threshold. However, this work instead focuses on constraining DNN weights by applying saturated activation functions (SAFs): Tanh, Arctan, and others. SAFs prevent faults from causing DNN weights to become excessively large, which can lead to model failure. These methods not only enhance the robustness of DNNs against fault injections but also improve DNN performance by a small margin. Before deployment, DNNs are trained with weights constrained by SAFs. During deployment, the weights without applied SAF are written to mediums with faults. When read, weights with faults are applied with SAFs and are used for inference. We demonstrate our proposed method across three datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet 2012) and across three datatypes (32-bit floating point (FP32), 16-bit floating point, and 8-bit fixed point). We show that our method enables FP32 ResNet18 with ImageNet 2012 to operate at a bit-error rate of 0.00001 with minor accuracy loss, while without the proposed method, the FP32 DNN only produces random guesses. Furthermore, to accelerate the training process, we demonstrate that an ImageNet 2012 pre-trained ResNet18 can be adapted to SAF by training for a few epochs with a slight improvement in Top-1 accuracy while still ensuring robustness against fault injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushant Agarwal, Yukti Makhija, Rishi Saket, Aravindan Raghuveer</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Regression (MIR) and Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) are learning frameworks arising in many applications, where the training data is partitioned into disjoint sets or bags, and only an aggregate label i.e., bag-label for each bag is available to the learner. In the case of MIR, the bag-label is the label of an undisclosed instance from the bag, while in LLP, the bag-label is the mean of the bag's labels. In this paper, we study for various loss functions in MIR and LLP, what is the optimal way to partition the dataset into bags such that the utility for downstream tasks like linear regression is maximized. We theoretically provide utility guarantees, and show that in each case, the optimal bagging strategy (approximately) reduces to finding an optimal clustering of the feature vectors or the labels with respect to natural objectives such as $k$-means. We also show that our bagging mechanisms can be made label-differentially private, incurring an additional utility error. We then generalize our results to the setting of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Finally, we experimentally validate our theoretical results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sub-seasonal wind speed forecasts provide valuable guidance for wind power system planning and operations, yet the forecasting skills of surface winds decrease sharply after two weeks. However, large-scale variables exhibit greater predictability on this time scale. This study explores the potential of leveraging non-linear relationships between 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) and surface wind speed to improve subs-seasonal wind speed forecasting skills in Europe. Our proposed framework uses a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress surface wind speed from Z500. Evaluations on ERA5 reanalysis indicate that the CNN performs better due to their non-linearity. Applying these models to sub-seasonal forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, various verification metrics demonstrate the advantages of non-linearity. Yet, this is partly explained by the fact that these statistical models are under-dispersive since they explain only a fraction of the target variable variance. Introducing stochastic perturbations to represent the stochasticity of the unexplained part from the signal helps compensate for this issue. Results show that the perturbed CNN performs better than the perturbed MLR only in the first weeks, while the perturbed MLR's performance converges towards that of the perturbed CNN after two weeks. The study finds that introducing stochastic perturbations can address the issue of insufficient spread in these statistical models, with improvements from the non-linearity varying with the lead time of the forecasts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dae-Young Yun, Hee-Youl Kwak, Yongjune Kim, Sang-Hyo Kim, Jong-Seon No</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural window decoder (NWD) for spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes. The proposed NWD retains the conventional window decoder (WD) process but incorporates trainable neural weights. To train the weights of NWD, we introduce two novel training strategies. First, we restrict the loss function to target variable nodes (VNs) of the window, which prunes the neural network and accordingly enhances training efficiency. Second, we employ the active learning technique with a normalized loss term to prevent the training process from biasing toward specific training regions. Next, we develop a systematic method to derive non-uniform schedules for the NWD based on the training results. We introduce trainable damping factors that reflect the relative importance of check node (CN) updates. By skipping updates with less importance, we can omit $\mathbf{41\%}$ of CN updates without performance degradation compared to the conventional WD. Lastly, we address the error propagation problem inherent in SC-LDPC codes by deploying a complementary weight set, which is activated when an error is detected in the previous window. This adaptive decoding strategy effectively mitigates error propagation without requiring modifications to the code and decoder structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing environmentally sustainable refrigerants is critical for mitigating the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on global warming. This study presents a predictive modeling framework to estimate the 100-year global warming potential (GWP 100) of single-component refrigerants using a fully connected neural network implemented on the Multi-Sigma platform. Molecular descriptors from RDKit, Mordred, and alvaDesc were utilized to capture various chemical features. The RDKit-based model achieved the best performance, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 481.9 and an R2 score of 0.918, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and generalizability. Dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and quantile transformation were applied to address the high-dimensional and skewed nature of the dataset,enhancing model stability and performance. Factor analysis identified vital molecular features, including molecular weight, lipophilicity, and functional groups, such as nitriles and allylic oxides, as significant contributors to GWP values. These insights provide actionable guidance for designing environmentally sustainable refrigerants. Integrating RDKit descriptors with Multi-Sigma's framework, which includes PCA, quantile transformation, and neural networks, provides a scalable solution for the rapid virtual screening of low-GWP refrigerants. This approach can potentially accelerate the identification of eco-friendly alternatives, directly contributing to climate mitigation by enabling the design of next-generation refrigerants aligned with global sustainability objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have made significant strides in modeling dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their generalization capabilities across varying scenarios remain limited. To overcome this limitation, we propose PIDO, a novel physics-informed neural PDE solver designed to generalize effectively across diverse PDE configurations, including varying initial conditions, PDE coefficients, and training time horizons. PIDO exploits the shared underlying structure of dynamical systems with different properties by projecting PDE solutions into a latent space using auto-decoding. It then learns the dynamics of these latent representations, conditioned on the PDE coefficients. Despite its promise, integrating latent dynamics models within a physics-informed framework poses challenges due to the optimization difficulties associated with physics-informed losses. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that diagnoses and mitigates these issues within the latent space. This strategy employs straightforward yet effective regularization techniques, enhancing both the temporal extrapolation performance and the training stability of PIDO. We validate PIDO on a range of benchmarks, including 1D combined equations and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of its learned representations to downstream applications such as long-term integration and inverse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Zhang, Zhen Qin, Zhaomin Wu, Shuiguang Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: A large amount of instructional text data is essential to enhance the performance of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks. This data can contain sensitive information and therefore cannot be shared in practice, resulting in data silos that limit the effectiveness of LLMs on various tasks. Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative fine-tuning across different clients without sharing their data. Nonetheless, in practice, this instructional text data is highly heterogeneous in both quantity and distribution across clients, necessitating distinct model structures to best accommodate the variations. However, existing federated fine-tuning approaches either enforce the same model structure or rely on predefined ad-hoc architectures unaware of data distribution, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedAMoLE, a lightweight personalized federated fine-tuning framework that leverages data-driven heterogeneous model architectures. FedAMoLE introduces the Adaptive Mixture of LoRA Experts (AMoLE) module, which facilitates model heterogeneity with minimal communication overhead by allocating varying numbers of LoRA-based domain experts to each client. Furthermore, we develop a reverse selection-based expert assignment (RSEA) strategy, which enables data-driven model architecture adjustment during fine-tuning by allowing domain experts to select clients that best align with their knowledge domains. Extensive experiments across six different scenarios of data heterogeneity demonstrate that FedAMoLE significantly outperforms existing methods for federated LLM fine-tuning, achieving superior accuracy while maintaining good scalability.</p>

We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their adoption is limited by high computational costs during inference. While increasing parameter counts enhances accuracy, it also widens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a framework to accelerate LLM inference on specific hardware while preserving their capabilities. Through an innovative application of neural architecture search (NAS) at an unprecedented scale, Puzzle systematically optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters under hardware constraints. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization.
  We demonstrate the real-world impact of our framework through Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while preserving 98.4% of the original model's capabilities. Nemotron-51B currently stands as the most accurate language model capable of inference on a single GPU with large batch sizes. Remarkably, this transformation required just 45B training tokens, compared to over 15T tokens used for the 70B model it was derived from. This establishes a new paradigm where powerful models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible compromise of their capabilities, demonstrating that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection. With the release of Nemotron-51B and the presentation of the Puzzle framework, we provide practitioners immediate access to state-of-the-art language modeling capabilities at significantly reduced computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Guo, Fei Zhu, Fanhu Zeng, Bing Liu, Xu-Yao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip models with the ability to retain previously learned knowledge like a human. Recent work incorporating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning has revitalized the field by introducing lightweight extension modules. However, existing methods usually overlook the issue of information leakage caused by the fact that the experiment data have been used in pre-trained models. Once these duplicate data are removed in the pre-training phase, their performance can be severely affected. In this paper, we propose a new LoRA-based rehearsal-free method named DESIRE. Our method avoids imposing additional constraints during training to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, thereby maximizing the learning of new classes. To integrate knowledge from old and new tasks, we propose two efficient post-processing modules. On the one hand, we retain only two sets of LoRA parameters for merging and propose dynamic representation consolidation to calibrate the merged feature representation. On the other hand, we propose decision boundary refinement to address classifier bias when training solely on new class data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and strikes an effective balance between stability and plasticity. Our code will be publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19181">Large width penalization for neural network-based prediction interval estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Worachit Amnuaypongsa, Jitkomut Songsiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting accuracy in highly uncertain environments is challenging due to the stochastic nature of systems. Deterministic forecasting provides only point estimates and cannot capture potential outcomes. Therefore, probabilistic forecasting has gained significant attention due to its ability to quantify uncertainty, where one of the approaches is to express it as a prediction interval (PI), that explicitly shows upper and lower bounds of predictions associated with a confidence level. High-quality PI is characterized by a high PI coverage probability (PICP) and a narrow PI width. In many real-world applications, the PI width is generally used in risk management to prepare resources that improve reliability and effectively manage uncertainty. A wider PI width results in higher costs for backup resources as decision-making processes often focus on the worst-case scenarios arising with large PI widths under extreme conditions. This study aims to reduce the large PI width from the PI estimation method by proposing a new PI loss function that penalizes the average of the large PI widths more heavily. The proposed formulation is compatible with gradient-based algorithms, the standard approach to training neural networks (NNs), and integrating state-of-the-art NNs and existing deep learning techniques. Experiments with the synthetic dataset reveal that our formulation significantly reduces the large PI width while effectively maintaining the PICP to achieve the desired probability. The practical implementation of our proposed loss function is demonstrated in solar irradiance forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness in minimizing the large PI width in data with high uncertainty and showcasing its compatibility with more complex neural network models. Therefore, reducing large PI widths from our method can lead to significant cost savings by over-allocation of reserve resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pekka Malo, Lauri Viitasaari, Antti Suominen, Eeva Vilkkumaa, Olli Tahvonen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon dynamic decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints. Such safety-constrained decision processes are central to applications in autonomous systems, finance, and resource management, where policies must satisfy strict, state-dependent constraints. We consider a doubly-regularized RL framework that combines reward and parameter regularization to address these constraints within continuous state-action spaces. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Our approach leverages recent developments in mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows to model policies as elements of an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with policy updates evolving via gradient flows on the space of parameter distributions. Our main contributions include establishing solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, defining smooth and bounded approximations that facilitate gradient flows, and demonstrating exponential convergence towards global solutions under sufficient regularization. We provide general conditions on regularization functions, encompassing standard entropy regularization as a special case. The results also enable a particle method implementation for practical RL applications. The theoretical insights and convergence guarantees presented here offer a robust framework for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional decision-making problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxu Wei, Kanhao Zhao, Yong Jiao, Nancy B. Carlisle, Hua Xie, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively utilizing extensive unlabeled high-density EEG data to improve performance in scenarios with limited labeled low-density EEG data presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we address this by framing it as a graph transfer learning and knowledge distillation problem. We propose a Unified Pre-trained Graph Contrastive Masked Autoencoder Distiller, named EEG-DisGCMAE, to bridge the gap between unlabeled/labeled and high/low-density EEG data. To fully leverage the abundant unlabeled EEG data, we introduce a novel unified graph self-supervised pre-training paradigm, which seamlessly integrates Graph Contrastive Pre-training and Graph Masked Autoencoder Pre-training. This approach synergistically combines contrastive and generative pre-training techniques by reconstructing contrastive samples and contrasting the reconstructions. For knowledge distillation from high-density to low-density EEG data, we propose a Graph Topology Distillation loss function, allowing a lightweight student model trained on low-density data to learn from a teacher model trained on high-density data, effectively handling missing electrodes through contrastive distillation. To integrate transfer learning and distillation, we jointly pre-train the teacher and student models by contrasting their queries and keys during pre-training, enabling robust distillers for downstream tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on four classification tasks across two clinical EEG datasets with abundant unlabeled data and limited labeled data. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms contemporary methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of client participation in federated learning, where traditional methods typically rely on a random selection of a small subset of clients for each training round. In contrast, we propose FedBack, a deterministic approach that leverages control-theoretic principles to manage client participation in ADMM-based federated learning. FedBack models client participation as a discrete-time dynamical system and employs an integral feedback controller to adjust each client's participation rate individually, based on the client's optimization dynamics. We provide global convergence guarantees for our approach by building on the recent federated learning research. Numerical experiments on federated image classification demonstrate that FedBack achieves up to 50\% improvement in communication and computational efficiency over algorithms that rely on a random selection of clients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianming Pan, Zeqi Ye, Xiao Yang, Xu Yang, Weiqing Liu, Lewen Wang, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven decision-making processes increasingly utilize end-to-end learnable deep neural networks to render final decisions. Sometimes, the output of the forward functions in certain layers is determined by the solutions to mathematical optimization problems, leading to the emergence of differentiable optimization layers that permit gradient back-propagation. However, real-world scenarios often involve large-scale datasets and numerous constraints, presenting significant challenges. Current methods for differentiating optimization problems typically rely on implicit differentiation, which necessitates costly computations on the Jacobian matrices, resulting in low efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BPQP, a differentiable convex optimization framework designed for efficient end-to-end learning. To enhance efficiency, we reformulate the backward pass as a simplified and decoupled quadratic programming problem by leveraging the structural properties of the KKT matrix. This reformulation enables the use of first-order optimization algorithms in calculating the backward pass gradients, allowing our framework to potentially utilize any state-of-the-art solver. As solver technologies evolve, BPQP can continuously adapt and improve its efficiency. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that BPQP achieves a significant improvement in efficiency--typically an order of magnitude faster in overall execution time compared to other differentiable optimization layers. Our results not only highlight the efficiency gains of BPQP but also underscore its superiority over differentiable optimization layer baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasting irregular time series presents significant challenges due to two key issues: the vulnerability of models to mean regression, driven by the noisy and complex nature of the data, and the limitations of traditional error-based evaluation metrics, which fail to capture meaningful patterns and penalize unrealistic forecasts. These problems result in forecasts that often misalign with human intuition. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning framework with a deep analysis of adversarial components. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of balancing the modeling of global distribution (overall patterns) and transition dynamics (localized temporal changes) to better capture the nuances of irregular time series. Overall, this research provides practical insights for improving models and evaluation metrics, and pioneers the application of adversarial learning in the domian of irregular time-series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhi Hu, Geoffrey Ye Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Future communication networks are expected to connect massive distributed artificial intelligence (AI). Exploiting aligned priori knowledge of AI pairs, it is promising to convert high-dimensional data transmission into highly-compressed semantic communications (SC). However, to accommodate the local data distribution and user preferences, AIs generally adapt to different domains, which fundamentally distorts the SC alignment. In this paper, we propose a zero-forget domain adaptation (ZFDA) framework to preserve SC alignment. To prevent the DA from changing substantial neural parameters of AI, we design sparse additive modifications (SAM) to the parameters, which can be efficiently stored and switched-off to restore the SC alignment. To optimize the SAM, we decouple it into tractable continuous variables and a binary mask, and then handle the binary mask by a score-based optimization. Experimental evaluations on a SC system for image transmissions validate that the proposed framework perfectly preserves the SC alignment with almost no loss of DA performance, even improved in some cases, at a cost of less than 1% of additional memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address two fundamental challenges in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): (1) the lack of theoretical support for invariance learning, a critical property in image processing, and (2) the absence of a unified model capable of excelling on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets. To tackle these issues, we establish and prove scale invariance in graphs, extending this key property to graph learning, and validate it through experiments on real-world datasets. Leveraging directed multi-scaled graphs and an adaptive self-loop strategy, we propose ScaleNet, a unified network architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance across four homophilic and two heterophilic benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that through graph transformation based on scale invariance, uniform weights can replace computationally expensive edge weights in digraph inception networks while maintaining or improving performance. For another popular GNN approach to digraphs, we demonstrate the equivalence between Hermitian Laplacian methods and GraphSAGE with incidence normalization. ScaleNet bridges the gap between homophilic and heterophilic graph learning, offering both theoretical insights into scale invariance and practical advancements in unified graph learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giang Do, Kha Pham, Hung Le, Truyen Tran</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) is an effective solution for scaling up model capacity without increasing the computational costs. A crucial component of SMoE is the router, responsible for directing the input to relevant experts; however, it also presents a major weakness, leading to routing inconsistencies and representation collapse issues. Instead of fixing the router like previous works, we propose an alternative that assigns experts to input via indirection, which employs the discrete representation of input that points to the expert. The discrete representations are learnt via vector quantization, resulting in a new architecture dubbed Vector-Quantized Mixture of Experts (VQMoE). We provide theoretical support and empirical evidence demonstrating the VQMoE's ability to overcome the challenges present in traditional routers. Through extensive evaluations on both large language models and vision tasks for pre-training and fine-tuning, we show that VQMoE achieves a 28% improvement in robustness compared to other SMoE routing methods, while maintaining strong performance in fine-tuning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhant Agarwal, Harshit Sikchi, Peter Stone, Amy Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Having explored an environment, intelligent agents should be able to transfer their knowledge to most downstream tasks within that environment. Referred to as "zero-shot learning," this ability remains elusive for general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms. While recent works have attempted to produce zero-shot RL agents, they make assumptions about the nature of the tasks or the structure of the MDP. We present \emph{Proto Successor Measure}: the basis set for all possible solutions of Reinforcement Learning in a dynamical system. We provably show that any possible policy can be represented using an affine combination of these policy independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these basis corresponding to the optimal policy. We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using only interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions.

<p>Abstract: Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from gradient exchanging of neural networks during federated learning. However, none of the existing works have studied the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attack. To answer this question, the present paper studies the problem of whether private data can be recovered from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and { proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG)}. Two widely-used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on recovery are extensively discussed. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, it is shown that parts of the graph data can be leaked from the gradients.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space model (SSM) parameters primarily rely on the HiPPO framework \citep{gu2023how}, which is based on online function approximation with the SSM kernel basis. However, the HiPPO framework does not explicitly account for the effects of the temporal structures of input sequences on the optimization of SSMs. In this paper, we take a further step to investigate the roles of SSM initialization schemes by considering the autocorrelation of input sequences. Specifically, we: (1) rigorously characterize the dependency of the SSM timescale on sequence length based on sequence autocorrelation; (2) find that with a proper timescale, allowing a zero real part for the eigenvalues of the SSM state matrix mitigates the curse of memory while still maintaining stability at initialization; (3) show that the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the SSM state matrix determines the conditioning of SSM optimization problems, and uncover an approximation-estimation tradeoff when training SSMs with a specific class of target functions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current random feature models typically rely on fixed activation functions, limiting their ability to capture diverse patterns in data. To address this, we introduce the Random Feature model with Learnable Activation Functions (RFLAF), a novel model that significantly enhances the expressivity and interpretability of traditional random feature (RF) models. We begin by studying the RF model with a single radial basis function, where we discover a new kernel and provide the first theoretical analysis on it. By integrating the basis functions with learnable weights, we show that RFLAF can represent a broad class of random feature models whose activation functions belong in $C_c(\mathbb{R})$. Theoretically, we prove that the model requires only about twice the parameter number compared to a traditional RF model to achieve the significant leap in expressivity. Experimentally, RFLAF demonstrates two key advantages: (1) it performs better across various tasks compared to traditional RF model with the same number of parameters, and (2) the optimized weights offer interpretability, as the learned activation function can be directly inferred from these weights. Our model paves the way for developing more expressive and interpretable frameworks within random feature models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debapriya Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is a long-standing problem area in data mining. The centroid-based classical approaches to clustering mainly face difficulty in the case of high dimensional inputs such as images. With the advent of deep neural networks, a common approach to this problem is to map the data to some latent space of comparatively lower dimensions and then do the clustering in that space. Network architectures adopted for this are generally autoencoders that reconstruct a given input in the output. To keep the input in some compact form, the encoder in AE's learns to extract useful features that get decoded at the reconstruction end. A well-known centroid-based clustering algorithm is K-means. In the context of deep feature learning, recent works have empirically shown the importance of learning the representations and the cluster centroids together. However, in this aspect of joint learning, recently a continuous variant of K-means has been proposed; where the softmax function is used in place of argmax to learn the clustering and network parameters jointly using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, unlike K-means, where the input space stays constant, here the learning of the centroid is done in parallel to the learning of the latent space for every batch of data. Such batch updates disagree with the concept of classical K-means, where the clustering space remains constant as it is the input space itself. To this end, we propose to alternatively learn a clustering-friendly data representation and K-means based cluster centers. Experiments on some benchmark datasets have shown improvements of our approach over the previous approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure subtype classification enhances clinical diagnosis efficiency. Source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation (SF-SSDA), which transfers a pre-trained model to a new dataset with no source data and limited labeled target data, can be used for privacy-preserving seizure subtype classification. This paper considers two challenges in SF-SSDA for EEG-based seizure subtype classification: 1) How to effectively fuse both raw EEG data and expert knowledge in classifier design? 2) How to align the source and target domain distributions for SF-SSDA? We propose a Knowledge-Data Fusion based SF-SSDA approach, KDF-MutualSHOT, for EEG-based seizure subtype classification. In source model training, KDF uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to facilitate mutual learning between a feature-driven Decision Tree-based model and a data-driven Transformer-based model. To adapt KDF to a new target dataset, an SF-SSDA algorithm, MutualSHOT, is developed, which features a consistency-based pseudo-label selection strategy. Experiments on the public TUSZ and CHSZ datasets demonstrated that KDF-MutualSHOT outperformed other supervised and source-free domain adaptation approaches in cross-subject seizure subtype classification.</p>

However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19517">RL-MILP Solver: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programs with Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tae-Hoon Lee, Min-Soo Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is an optimization technique widely used in various fields. Primal heuristics, which reduce the search space of MILP, have enabled traditional solvers (e.g., Gurobi) to efficiently find high-quality solutions. However, traditional primal heuristics rely on expert knowledge, motivating the advent of machine learning (ML)-based primal heuristics that learn repetitive patterns in MILP. Nonetheless, existing ML-based primal heuristics do not guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) and primarily focus on prediction for binary decision variables. When addressing MILP involving non-binary integer variables using ML-based approaches, feasibility issues can become even more pronounced. Since finding an optimal solution requires satisfying all constraints, addressing feasibility is critical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that interacts with MILP to find feasible solutions, rather than delegating sub-problems to traditional solvers. We design reward functions tailored for MILP, which enables the RL agent to learn relationships between decision variables and constraints. Additionally, to effectively model complex relationships among decision variables, we leverage a Transformer encoder-based graph neural network (GNN). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can solve MILP problems and find near-optimal solutions without delegating the remainder to traditional solvers. The proposed method provides a meaningful step forward as an initial study in solving MILP problems end-to-end based solely on ML.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosi Gu, Tomoyuki Obuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning methodology that leverages unlabeled data in conjunction with a limited amount of labeled data. Although SSL has been applied in various applications and its effectiveness has been empirically demonstrated, it is still not fully understood when and why SSL performs well. Some existing theoretical studies have attempted to address this issue by modeling classification problems using the so-called Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These studies provide notable and insightful interpretations. However, their analyses are focused on specific purposes, and a thorough investigation of the properties of GMM in the context of SSL has been lacking. In this paper, we conduct such a detailed analysis of the properties of the high-dimensional GMM for binary classification in the SSL setting. To this end, we employ the approximate message passing and state evolution methods, which are widely used in high-dimensional settings and originate from statistical mechanics. We deal with two estimation approaches: the Bayesian one and the l2-regularized maximum likelihood estimation (RMLE). We conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two approaches, examining aspects such as the global phase diagram, estimation error for the parameters, and prediction error for the labels. A specific comparison is made between the Bayes-optimal (BO) estimator and RMLE, as the BO setting provides optimal estimation performance and is ideal as a benchmark. Our analysis shows that with appropriate regularizations, RMLE can achieve near-optimal performance in terms of both the estimation error and prediction error, especially when there is a large amount of unlabeled data. These results demonstrate that the l2 regularization term plays an effective role in estimation and prediction in SSL approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parjanya Prashant, Ignavier Ng, Kun Zhang, Biwei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering causal structures with latent variables from observational data is a fundamental challenge in causal discovery. Existing methods often rely on constraint-based, iterative discrete searches, limiting their scalability to large numbers of variables. Moreover, these methods frequently assume linearity or invertibility, restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. We present new theoretical results on the identifiability of nonlinear latent hierarchical causal models, relaxing previous assumptions in literature about the deterministic nature of latent variables and exogenous noise. Building on these insights, we develop a novel differentiable causal discovery algorithm that efficiently estimates the structure of such models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a differentiable causal discovery method for nonlinear latent hierarchical models. Our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and scalability. We demonstrate its practical utility by learning interpretable hierarchical latent structures from high-dimensional image data and demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Lin, Siyu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rubiks Cube, with its vast state space and sparse reward structure, presents a significant challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) due to the difficulty of reaching rewarded states. Previous research addressed this by propagating cost-to-go estimates from the solved state and incorporating search techniques. These approaches differ from human strategies that start from fully scrambled cubes, which can be tricky for solving a general sparse-reward problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel RL algorithm using policy gradient methods to solve the Rubiks Cube without relying on near solved-state sampling. Our approach employs a neural network to predict cost patterns between states, allowing the agent to learn directly from scrambled states. Our method was tested on the 2x2x2 Rubiks Cube, where the cube was scrambled 50,000 times, and the model successfully solved it in over 99.4% of cases. Notably, this result was achieved using only the policy network without relying on tree search as in previous methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in sparse-reward problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hemal Mahmud, Hasan Mahmud</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis (SA) is a process of identifying the emotional tone or polarity within a given text and aims to uncover the user's complex emotions and inner feelings. While sentiment analysis has been extensively studied for languages like English, research in Bengali, remains limited, particularly for fine-grained sentiment categorization. This work aims to connect this gap by developing a novel approach that integrates rule-based algorithms with pre-trained language models. We developed a dataset from scratch, comprising over 15,000 manually labeled reviews. Next, we constructed a Lexicon Data Dictionary, assigning polarity scores to the reviews. We developed a novel rule based algorithm Bangla Sentiment Polarity Score (BSPS), an approach capable of generating sentiment scores and classifying reviews into nine distinct sentiment categories. To assess the performance of this method, we evaluated the classified sentiments using BanglaBERT, a pre-trained transformer-based language model. We also performed sentiment classification directly with BanglaBERT on the original data and evaluated this model's results. Our analysis revealed that the BSPS + BanglaBERT hybrid approach outperformed the standalone BanglaBERT model, achieving higher accuracy, precision, and nuanced classification across the nine sentiment categories. The results of our study emphasize the value and effectiveness of combining rule-based and pre-trained language model approaches for enhanced sentiment analysis in Bengali and suggest pathways for future research and application in languages with similar linguistic complexities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marlon Becker, Benjamin Risse</p>
<p>Abstract: We empirically investigate the impact of learning randomly generated labels in parallel to class labels in supervised learning on memorization, model complexity, and generalization in deep neural networks. To this end, we introduce a multi-head network architecture as an extension of standard CNN architectures. Inspired by methods used in fair AI, our approach allows for the unlearning of random labels, preventing the network from memorizing individual samples. Based on the concept of Rademacher complexity, we first use our proposed method as a complexity metric to analyze the effects of common regularization techniques and challenge the traditional understanding of feature extraction and classification in CNNs. Second, we propose a novel regularizer that effectively reduces sample memorization. However, contrary to the predictions of classical statistical learning theory, we do not observe improvements in generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaowen Wang, Anan Liu, Jian Xiao, Huan Liu, Yuekui Yang, Cong Xu, Qianqian Pu, Suncong Zheng, Wei Zhang, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern recommendation systems frequently employ online learning to dynamically update their models with freshly collected data. The most commonly used optimizer for updating neural networks in these contexts is the Adam optimizer, which integrates momentum ($m_t$) and adaptive learning rate ($v_t$). However, the volatile nature of online learning data, characterized by its frequent distribution shifts and presence of noises, poses significant challenges to Adam's standard optimization process: (1) Adam may use outdated momentum and the average of squared gradients, resulting in slower adaptation to distribution changes, and (2) Adam's performance is adversely affected by data noise. To mitigate these issues, we introduce CAdam, a confidence-based optimization strategy that assesses the consistence between the momentum and the gradient for each parameter dimension before deciding on updates. If momentum and gradient are in sync, CAdam proceeds with parameter updates according to Adam's original formulation; if not, it temporarily withholds updates and monitors potential shifts in data distribution in subsequent iterations. This method allows CAdam to distinguish between the true distributional shifts and mere noise, and adapt more quickly to new data distributions. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CAdam surpasses other well-known optimizers, including the original Adam, in efficiency and noise robustness. Furthermore, in large-scale A/B testing within a live recommendation system, CAdam significantly enhances model performance compared to Adam, leading to substantial increases in the system's gross merchandise volume (GMV).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianliang Li, Jun Luo, Zhiwei Zheng, Hanxiao Wang, Li Luo, Lingkun Wen, Linlong Wu, Sheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Momentum-based optimizers are widely adopted for training neural networks. However, the optimal selection of momentum coefficients remains elusive. This uncertainty impedes a clear understanding of the role of momentum in stochastic gradient methods. In this paper, we present a frequency domain analysis framework that interprets the momentum method as a time-variant filter for gradients, where adjustments to momentum coefficients modify the filter characteristics. Our experiments support this perspective and provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism involved. Moreover, our analysis reveals the following significant findings: high-frequency gradient components are undesired in the late stages of training; preserving the original gradient in the early stages, and gradually amplifying low-frequency gradient components during training both enhance generalization performance. Based on these insights, we propose Frequency Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (FSGDM), a heuristic optimizer that dynamically adjusts the momentum filtering characteristic with an empirically effective dynamic magnitude response. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSGDM over conventional momentum optimizers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqing Zhang, Yuchen Ding, Wei Tang, Wei Sun, Yong Liao, Peng Yuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Under stringent privacy constraints, whether federated recommendation systems can achieve group fairness remains an inadequately explored question. Taking gender fairness as a representative issue, we identify three phenomena in federated recommendation systems: performance difference, data imbalance, and preference disparity. We discover that the state-of-the-art methods only focus on the first phenomenon. Consequently, their imposition of inappropriate fairness constraints detrimentally affects the model training. Moreover, due to insufficient sensitive attribute protection of existing works, we can infer the gender of all users with 99.90% accuracy even with the addition of maximal noise. In this work, we propose Privacy-Preserving Orthogonal Aggregation (PPOA), which employs the secure aggregation scheme and quantization technique, to prevent the suppression of minority groups by the majority and preserve the distinct preferences for better group fairness. PPOA can assist different groups in obtaining their respective model aggregation results through a designed orthogonal mapping while keeping their attributes private. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PPOA enhances recommendation effectiveness for both females and males by up to 8.25% and 6.36%, respectively, with a maximum overall improvement of 7.30%, and achieves optimal fairness in most cases. Extensive ablation experiments and visualizations indicate that PPOA successfully maintains preferences for different gender groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre O. Falcao</p>
<p>Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a powerful statistical measure that quantifies shared information between random variables, particularly valuable in high-dimensional data analysis across fields like genomics, natural language processing, and network science. However, computing MI becomes computationally prohibitive for large datasets where it is typically required a pairwise computational approach where each column is compared to others. This work introduces a matrix-based algorithm that accelerates MI computation by leveraging vectorized operations and optimized matrix calculations. By transforming traditional pairwise computational approaches into bulk matrix operations, the proposed method enables efficient MI calculation across all variable pairs. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with computation times reduced up to 50,000 times in the largest dataset using optimized implementations, particularly when utilizing hardware optimized frameworks. The approach promises to expand MI's applicability in data-driven research by overcoming previous computational limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom\'as H\"uttebr\"aucker, Simone Fiorellino, Mohamed Sana, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Emilio Calvanese Strinati</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-user semantic communication, language mismatche poses a significant challenge when independently trained agents interact. We present a novel semantic equalization algorithm that enables communication between agents with different languages without additional retraining. Our algorithm is based on relative representations, a framework that enables different agents employing different neural network models to have unified representation. It proceeds by projecting the latent vectors of different models into a common space defined relative to a set of data samples called \textit{anchors}, whose number equals the dimension of the resulting space. A communication between different agents translates to a communication of semantic symbols sampled from this relative space. This approach, in addition to aligning the semantic representations of different agents, allows compressing the amount of information being exchanged, by appropriately selecting the number of anchors. Eventually, we introduce a novel anchor selection strategy, which advantageously determines prototypical anchors, capturing the most relevant information for the downstream task. Our numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach allowing seamless communication between agents with radically different models, including differences in terms of neural network architecture and datasets used for initial training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Tschannen, Andr\'e Susano Pinto, Alexander Kolesnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Removing modeling constraints and unifying architectures across domains has been a key driver of the recent progress in training large multimodal models. However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: In light of the inherently complex and dynamic nature of real-world environments, incorporating risk measures is crucial for the robustness evaluation of deep learning models. In this work, we propose a Risk-Averse Certification framework for Bayesian neural networks called RAC-BNN. Our method leverages sampling and optimisation to compute a sound approximation of the output set of a BNN, represented using a set of template polytopes. To enhance robustness evaluation, we integrate a coherent distortion risk measure--Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)--into the certification framework, providing probabilistic guarantees based on empirical distributions obtained through sampling. We validate RAC-BNN on a range of regression and classification benchmarks and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art method. The results show that RAC-BNN effectively quantifies robustness under worst-performing risky scenarios, and achieves tighter certified bounds and higher efficiency in complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heloisa Oss Boll, Ali Amirahmadi, Amira Soliman, Stefan Byttner, Mariana Recamonde-Mendoza</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: In modern healthcare, accurately predicting diseases is a crucial matter. This study introduces a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) and a Graph Transformer (GT) to predict the incidence of heart failure (HF) on a patient similarity graph at the next hospital visit. Materials and Methods: We used electronic health records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset and applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create a patient similarity graph using embeddings from diagnoses, procedures, and medications. Three models - GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Network (GAT), and Graph Transformer (GT) - were implemented to predict HF incidence. Model performance was evaluated using F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC metrics, and results were compared against baseline algorithms. An interpretability analysis was performed to understand the model's decision-making process. Results: The GT model demonstrated the best performance (F1 score: 0.5361, AUROC: 0.7925, AUPRC: 0.5168). Although the Random Forest (RF) baseline achieved a similar AUPRC value, the GT model offered enhanced interpretability due to the use of patient relationships in the graph structure. A joint analysis of attention weights, graph connectivity, and clinical features provided insight into model predictions across different classification groups. Discussion and Conclusion: Graph-based approaches such as GNNs provide an effective framework for predicting HF. By leveraging a patient similarity graph, GNNs can capture complex relationships in EHR data, potentially improving prediction accuracy and clinical interpretability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant surge in complex AI systems for competitive programming, capable of performing at admirable levels against human competitors. While steady progress has been made, the highest percentiles still remain out of reach for these methods on standard competition platforms such as Codeforces. Here we instead focus on combinatorial competitive programming, where the target is to find as-good-as-possible solutions to otherwise computationally intractable problems, over specific given inputs. We hypothesise that this scenario offers a unique testbed for human-AI synergy, as human programmers can write a backbone of a heuristic solution, after which AI can be used to optimise the scoring function used by the heuristic. We deploy our approach on previous iterations of Hash Code, a global team programming competition inspired by NP-hard software engineering problems at Google, and we leverage FunSearch to evolve our scoring functions. Our evolved solutions significantly improve the attained scores from their baseline, successfully breaking into the top percentile on all previous Hash Code online qualification rounds, and outperforming the top human teams on several. Our method is also performant on an optimisation problem that featured in a recent held-out AtCoder contest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana\"is Berkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Building operations consume approximately 40% of global energy, with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems responsible for up to 50% of this consumption. As HVAC energy demands are expected to rise, optimising system efficiency is crucial for reducing future energy use and mitigating climate change. Existing control strategies lack generalisation and require extensive training and data, limiting their rapid deployment across diverse buildings. This paper introduces HVAC-DPT, a Decision-Pretrained Transformer using in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-zone HVAC control. HVAC-DPT frames HVAC control as a sequential prediction task, training a causal transformer on interaction histories generated by diverse RL agents. This approach enables HVAC-DPT to refine its policy in-context, without modifying network parameters, allowing for deployment across different buildings without the need for additional training or data collection. HVAC-DPT reduces energy consumption in unseen buildings by 45% compared to the baseline controller, offering a scalable and effective approach to mitigating the increasing environmental impact of HVAC systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaican Li, Weiyan Xie, Yongxiang Huang, Didan Deng, Lanqing Hong, Zhenguo Li, Ricardo Silva, Nevin L. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models often compromises their robustness to distribution shifts. To remedy this, most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pre-trained features. However, not all pre-trained features are robust and those methods are largely indifferent to which ones to preserve. We propose dual risk minimization (DRM), which combines empirical risk minimization with worst-case risk minimization, to better preserve the core features of downstream tasks. In particular, we utilize core-feature descriptions generated by LLMs to induce core-based zero-shot predictions which then serve as proxies to estimate the worst-case risk. DRM balances two crucial aspects of model robustness: expected performance and worst-case performance, establishing a new state of the art on various real-world benchmarks. DRM significantly improves the out-of-distribution performance of CLIP ViT-L/14@336 on ImageNet (75.9 to 77.1), WILDS-iWildCam (47.1 to 51.8), and WILDS-FMoW (50.7 to 53.1); opening up new avenues for robust fine-tuning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahabeh Saadati, Mohammad Manthouri</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of price behavior in the foreign exchange market is crucial. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages technical indicators and deep neural networks. The proposed architecture consists of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and attention mechanism. Initially, trend and oscillation technical indicators are employed to extract statistical features from Forex currency pair data, providing insights into price trends, market volatility, relative price strength, and overbought and oversold conditions. Subsequently, the LSTM and CNN networks are utilized in parallel to predict future price movements, leveraging the strengths of both recurrent and convolutional architectures. The LSTM network captures long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the data, while the CNN network extracts local patterns. The outputs of the parallel LSTM and CNN networks are then fed into an attention mechanism, which learns to weigh the importance of each feature and temporal dependency, generating a context-aware representation of the input data. The attention-weighted output is then used to predict future price movements, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and temporal dependencies. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple Forex currency pairs, we demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting price behavior and outperforming benchmark models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of stock market trends is crucial for informed investment decisions and effective portfolio management, ultimately leading to enhanced wealth creation and risk mitigation. This study proposes a novel approach for predicting stock prices in the stock market by integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, using sentiment analysis of social network data and candlestick data (price). The proposed methodology consists of two primary components: sentiment analysis of social network and candlestick data. By amalgamating candlestick data with insights gleaned from Twitter, this approach facilitates a more detailed and accurate examination of market trends and patterns, ultimately leading to more effective stock price predictions. Additionally, a Random Forest algorithm is used to classify tweets as either positive or negative, allowing for a more subtle and informed assessment of market sentiment. This study uses CNN and LSTM networks to predict stock prices. The CNN extracts short-term features, while the LSTM models long-term dependencies. The integration of both networks enables a more comprehensive analysis of market trends and patterns, leading to more accurate stock price predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeheon Woo, Seonghwan Kim, Jun Hyeong Kim, Woo Youn Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a modified score matching method aimed at generating molecular structures with high energy accuracy. The denoising process of score matching or diffusion models mirrors molecular structure optimization, where scores act like physical force fields that guide particles toward equilibrium states. To achieve energetically accurate structures, it can be advantageous to have the score closely approximate the gradient of the actual potential energy surface. Unlike conventional methods that simply design the target score based on structural differences in Euclidean space, we propose a Riemannian score matching approach. This method represents molecular structures on a manifold defined by physics-informed internal coordinates to efficiently mimic the energy landscape, and performs noising and denoising within this space. Our method has been evaluated by refining several types of starting structures on the QM9 and GEOM datasets, demonstrating that the proposed Riemannian score matching method significantly improves the accuracy of the generated molecular structures, attaining chemical accuracy. The implications of this study extend to various applications in computational chemistry, offering a robust tool for accurate molecular structure prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armin Saghafian, Amirmohammad Izadi, Negin Hashemi Dijujin, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah</p>
<p>Abstract: Grounding the instruction in the environment is a key step in solving language-guided goal-reaching reinforcement learning problems. In automated reinforcement learning, a key concern is to enhance the model's ability to generalize across various tasks and environments. In goal-reaching scenarios, the agent must comprehend the different parts of the instructions within the environmental context in order to complete the overall task successfully. In this work, we propose CAREL (Cross-modal Auxiliary REinforcement Learning) as a new framework to solve this problem using auxiliary loss functions inspired by video-text retrieval literature and a novel method called instruction tracking, which automatically keeps track of progress in an environment. The results of our experiments suggest superior sample efficiency and systematic generalization for this framework in multi-modal reinforcement learning problems. Our code base is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Natalie Collina, Surbhi Goel, Varun Gupta, Aaron Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an efficient reduction that converts any machine learning algorithm into an interactive protocol, enabling collaboration with another party (e.g., a human) to achieve consensus on predictions and improve accuracy. This approach imposes calibration conditions on each party, which are computationally and statistically tractable relaxations of Bayesian rationality. These conditions are sensible even in prior-free settings, representing a significant generalization of Aumann's classic "agreement theorem."
  In our protocol, the model first provides a prediction. The human then responds by either agreeing or offering feedback. The model updates its state and revises its prediction, while the human may adjust their beliefs. This iterative process continues until the two parties reach agreement. Initially, we study a setting that extends Aumann's Agreement Theorem, where parties aim to agree on a one-dimensional expectation by iteratively sharing their current estimates. Here, we recover the convergence theorem of Aaronson'05 under weaker assumptions. We then address the case where parties hold beliefs over distributions with d outcomes, exploring two feedback mechanisms. The first involves vector-valued estimates of predictions, while the second adopts a decision-theoretic approach: the human, needing to take an action from a finite set based on utility, communicates their utility-maximizing action at each round. In this setup, the number of rounds until agreement remains independent of d. Finally, we generalize to scenarios with more than two parties, where computational complexity scales linearly with the number of participants. Our protocols rely on simple, efficient conditions and produce predictions that surpass the accuracy of any individual party's alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenguang Xiao, Shuo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data Heterogeneity is a major challenge of Federated Learning performance. Recently, momentum based optimization techniques have beed proved to be effective in mitigating the heterogeneity issue. Along with the model updates, the momentum updates are transmitted to the server side and aggregated. Therefore, the local training initialized with a global momentum is guided by the global history of the gradients. However, we spot a problem in the traditional cumulation of the momentum which is suboptimal in the Federated Learning systems. The momentum used to weight less on the historical gradients and more on the recent gradients. This however, will engage more biased local gradients in the end of the local training. In this work, we propose a new way to calculate the estimated momentum used in local initialization. The proposed method is named as Reversed Momentum Federated Learning (RMFL). The key idea is to assign exponentially decayed weights to the gradients with the time going forward, which is on the contrary to the traditional momentum cumulation. The effectiveness of RMFL is evaluated on three popular benchmark datasets with different heterogeneity levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Yunhui Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Architecture plays an important role in deciding the performance of deep neural networks. However, the search for the optimal architecture is often hindered by the vast search space, making it a time-intensive process. Recently, a novel approach known as training-free neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged, aiming to discover the ideal architecture without necessitating extensive training. Training-free NAS leverages various indicators for architecture selection, including metrics such as the count of linear regions, the density of per-sample losses, and the stability of the finite-width Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrix. Despite the competitive empirical performance of current training-free NAS techniques, they suffer from certain limitations, including inconsistent performance and a lack of deep understanding. In this paper, we introduce GradAlign, a simple yet effective method designed for inferring model performance without the need for training. At its core, GradAlign quantifies the extent of conflicts within per-sample gradients during initialization, as substantial conflicts hinder model convergence and ultimately result in worse performance. We evaluate GradAlign against established training-free NAS methods using standard NAS benchmarks, showing a better overall performance. Moreover, we show that the widely adopted metric of linear region count may not suffice as a dependable criterion for selecting network architectures during at initialization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19853">Towards Class-wise Robustness Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tejaswini Medi, Julia Grabinski, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: While being very successful in solving many downstream tasks, the application of deep neural networks is limited in real-life scenarios because of their susceptibility to domain shifts such as common corruptions, and adversarial attacks. The existence of adversarial examples and data corruption significantly reduces the performance of deep classification models. Researchers have made strides in developing robust neural architectures to bolster decisions of deep classifiers. However, most of these works rely on effective adversarial training methods, and predominantly focus on overall model robustness, disregarding class-wise differences in robustness, which are critical. Exploiting weakly robust classes is a potential avenue for attackers to fool the image recognition models. Therefore, this study investigates class-to-class biases across adversarially trained robust classification models to understand their latent space structures and analyze their strong and weak class-wise properties. We further assess the robustness of classes against common corruptions and adversarial attacks, recognizing that class vulnerability extends beyond the number of correct classifications for a specific class. We find that the number of false positives of classes as specific target classes significantly impacts their vulnerability to attacks. Through our analysis on the Class False Positive Score, we assess a fair evaluation of how susceptible each class is to misclassification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Peng, Jeffrey Quesnelle, Diederik P. Kingma</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large neural networks typically requires sharing gradients between accelerators through specialized high-speed interconnects. Drawing from the signal processing principles of frequency decomposition and energy compaction, we demonstrate that synchronizing full optimizer states and model parameters during training is unnecessary. By decoupling momentum updates and allowing controlled divergence in optimizer states across accelerators, we achieve improved convergence compared to state-of-the-art optimizers. We introduce {\textbf{De}}coupled {\textbf{Mo}}mentum (DeMo), a fused optimizer and data parallel algorithm that reduces inter-accelerator communication requirements by several orders of magnitude. This enables training of large neural networks even with limited network bandwidth and heterogeneous hardware. Our method is topology-agnostic and architecture-independent and supports scalable clock-synchronous distributed training with negligible compute and memory overhead. Empirical results show that models trained with DeMo match or exceed the performance of equivalent models trained with AdamW, while eliminating the need for high-speed interconnects when pre-training large scale foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guiran Liu, Binrong Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigated the dynamic connectivity patterns between EEG and fMRI modalities, contributing to our understanding of brain network interactions. By employing a comprehensive approach that integrated static and dynamic analyses of EEG-fMRI data, we were able to uncover distinct connectivity states and characterize their temporal fluctuations. The results revealed modular organization within the intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) of the brain, highlighting the significant roles of sensory systems and the default mode network. The use of a sliding window technique allowed us to assess how functional connectivity varies over time, further elucidating the transient nature of brain connectivity. Additionally, our findings align with previous literature, reinforcing the notion that cognitive states can be effectively identified through short-duration data, specifically within the 30-60 second timeframe. The established relationships between connectivity strength and cognitive processes, particularly during different visual states, underscore the relevance of our approach for future research into brain dynamics. Overall, this study not only enhances our understanding of the interplay between EEG and fMRI signals but also paves the way for further exploration into the neural correlates of cognitive functions and their implications in clinical settings. Future research should focus on refining these methodologies and exploring their applications in various cognitive and clinical contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parjanya Prashant, Seyedeh Baharan Khatami, Bruno Ribeiro, Babak Salimi</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where the distribution shift is due to an unobserved confounder ($Z$) affecting both the covariates ($X$) and the labels ($Y$). In this setting, traditional assumptions of covariate and label shift are unsuitable due to the confounding, which introduces heterogeneity in the predictor, i.e., $\hat{Y} = f_Z(X)$. OOD generalization differs from traditional domain adaptation by not assuming access to the covariate distribution ($X^\text{te}$) of the test samples during training. These conditions create a challenging scenario for OOD robustness: (a) $Z^\text{tr}$ is an unobserved confounder during training, (b) $P^\text{te}{Z} \neq P^\text{tr}{Z}$, (c) $X^\text{te}$ is unavailable during training, and (d) the posterior predictive distribution depends on $P^\text{te}(Z)$, i.e., $\hat{Y} = E_{P^\text{te}(Z)}[f_Z(X)]$. In general, accurate predictions are unattainable in this scenario, and existing literature has proposed complex predictors based on identifiability assumptions that require multiple additional variables. Our work investigates a set of identifiability assumptions that tremendously simplify the predictor, whose resulting elegant simplicity outperforms existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max M. Chumley, Firas A. Khasawneh</p>
<p>Abstract: Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models. Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diya Vatsavai, Anya Iyer, Ashwin A. Nair</p>
<p>Abstract: Parkinsons disease, the fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder globally, has seen a 50 percent increase in cases within just two years. As speech, memory, and motor symptoms worsen over time, early diagnosis is crucial for preserving patients quality of life. While machine-learning-based detection has shown promise, relying on a single feature for classification can be error-prone due to the variability of symptoms between patients. To address this limitation we utilized the mPower database, which includes 150,000 samples across four key biomarkers: voice, gait, tapping, and demographic data. From these measurements, we extracted 64 features and trained a baseline Random Forest model to select the features above the 80th percentile. For classification, we designed a simulatable quantum support vector machine (qSVM) that detects high-dimensional patterns, leveraging recent advancements in quantum machine learning. With a novel, simulatable architecture that can be run on standard hardware rather than resource-intensive quantum computers, our model achieves an accuracy of 90 percent and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing benchmark models. By utilizing an innovative classification framework built on a diverse set of features, our model offers a pathway for accessible global Parkinsons screening.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyung Hong, Yearim Kim, Keun Hee Park, Sangyu Han, Nojun Kwak, Theodore P. Pavlic</p>
<p>Abstract: Inner interpretability is a promising field focused on uncovering the internal mechanisms of AI systems and developing scalable, automated methods to understand these systems at a mechanistic level. While significant research has explored top-down approaches starting from high-level problems or algorithmic hypotheses and bottom-up approaches building higher-level abstractions from low-level or circuit-level descriptions, most efforts have concentrated on analyzing large language models. Moreover, limited attention has been given to applying inner interpretability to large-scale image tasks, primarily focusing on architectural and functional levels to visualize learned concepts. In this paper, we first present a conceptual framework that supports inner interpretability and multilevel analysis for large-scale image classification tasks. We introduce the Bi-directional Interaction between Concept and Input Embeddings (Bi-ICE) module, which facilitates interpretability across the computational, algorithmic, and implementation levels. This module enhances transparency by generating predictions based on human-understandable concepts, quantifying their contributions, and localizing them within the inputs. Finally, we showcase enhanced transparency in image classification, measuring concept contributions and pinpointing their locations within the inputs. Our approach highlights algorithmic interpretability by demonstrating the process of concept learning and its convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their outstanding performance in handling graph-related tasks, such as social network analysis, protein design, and so on. Despite their widespread application, recent research has demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, implemented by injecting triggers into the training datasets. Trained on the poisoned data, GNNs will predict target labels when attaching trigger patterns to inputs. This vulnerability poses significant security risks for applications of GNNs in sensitive domains, such as drug discovery. While there has been extensive research into backdoor defenses for images, strategies to safeguard GNNs against such attacks remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, we point out that conventional backdoor defense methods designed for images cannot work well when directly implemented on graph data. In this paper, we first analyze the key difference between image backdoor and graph backdoor attacks. Then we tackle the graph defense problem by presenting a novel approach called MADE, which devises an adversarial mask generation mechanism that selectively preserves clean sub-graphs and further leverages masks on edge weights to eliminate the influence of triggers effectively. Extensive experiments across various graph classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MADE in significantly reducing the attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a high classification accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans recognize objects after observing only a few examples, a remarkable capability enabled by their inherent language understanding of the real-world environment. Developing verbalized and interpretable representation can significantly improve model generalization in low-data settings. In this work, we propose Verbalized Representation Learning (VRL), a novel approach for automatically extracting human-interpretable features for object recognition using few-shot data. Our method uniquely captures inter-class differences and intra-class commonalities in the form of natural language by employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify key discriminative features between different classes and shared characteristics within the same class. These verbalized features are then mapped to numeric vectors through the VLM. The resulting feature vectors can be further utilized to train and infer with downstream classifiers. Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller mode. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> J\'er\'emie Sublime</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's world, AI programs powered by Machine Learning are ubiquitous, and have achieved seemingly exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks, from medical diagnosis and credit rating in banking, to theft detection via video analysis, and even predicting political or sexual orientation from facial images. These predominantly deep learning methods excel due to their extraordinary capacity to process vast amounts of complex data to extract complex correlations and relationship from different levels of features.
  In this paper, we contend that the designers and final users of these ML methods have forgotten a fundamental lesson from statistics: correlation does not imply causation. Not only do most state-of-the-art methods neglect this crucial principle, but by doing so they often produce nonsensical or flawed causal models, akin to social astrology or physiognomy. Consequently, we argue that current efforts to make AI models more ethical by merely reducing biases in the training data are insufficient. Through examples, we will demonstrate that the potential for harm posed by these methods can only be mitigated by a complete rethinking of their core models, improved quality assessment metrics and policies, and by maintaining humans oversight throughout the process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is the de facto standard for compressing large-scale models into smaller ones. Prior works have explored ever more complex KD strategies involving different objective functions, teacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an alternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective distillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch selection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-, data- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation strategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively combined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and scalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across 27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders for training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting, outperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual question-answering tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language-conditioned robot models (i.e., robotic foundation models) enable robots to perform a wide range of tasks based on natural language instructions. Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of these models is challenging due to the complexity of testing all possible language variations. Current benchmarks have two key limitations: they rely on a limited set of human-generated instructions, missing many challenging cases, and they focus only on task performance without assessing safety, such as avoiding damage. To address these gaps, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), a new evaluation method that generates diverse and challenging instructions to test these models. ERT uses automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to create contextually grounded, difficult instructions. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art models frequently fail or behave unsafely on ERT tests, underscoring the shortcomings of current benchmarks in evaluating real-world performance and safety.

<p>Abstract: Match-cuts are powerful cinematic tools that create seamless transitions between scenes, delivering strong visual and metaphorical connections. However, crafting match-cuts is a challenging, resource-intensive process requiring deliberate artistic planning. In MatchDiffusion, we present the first training-free method for match-cut generation using text-to-video diffusion models. MatchDiffusion leverages a key property of diffusion models: early denoising steps define the scene's broad structure, while later steps add details. Guided by this insight, MatchDiffusion employs "Joint Diffusion" to initialize generation for two prompts from shared noise, aligning structure and motion. It then applies "Disjoint Diffusion", allowing the videos to diverge and introduce unique details. This approach produces visually coherent videos suited for match-cuts. User studies and metrics demonstrate MatchDiffusion's effectiveness and potential to democratize match-cut creation.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks: carefully crafted image-prompt pairs that compel the model to generate harmful content. In this work, we first highlight a critical safety gap, demonstrating that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model during decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of Immune, offering provable guarantees against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chicago Y. Park, Michael T. McCann, Cristina Garcia-Cardona, Brendt Wohlberg, Ulugbek S. Kamilov</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a simple template for designing generative diffusion model algorithms based on an interpretation of diffusion sampling as a sequence of random walks. Score-based diffusion models are widely used to generate high-quality images. Diffusion models have also been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in many inverse problems. While these algorithms are often surprisingly simple, the theory behind them is not, and multiple complex theoretical justifications exist in the literature. Here, we provide a simple and largely self-contained theoretical justification for score-based-diffusion models that avoids using the theory of Markov chains or reverse diffusion, instead centering the theory of random walks and Tweedie's formula. This approach leads to unified algorithmic templates for network training and sampling. In particular, these templates cleanly separate training from sampling, e.g., the noise schedule used during training need not match the one used during sampling. We show that several existing diffusion models correspond to particular choices within this template and demonstrate that other, more straightforward algorithmic choices lead to effective diffusion models. The proposed framework has the added benefit of enabling conditional sampling without any likelihood approximation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eoin M. Kenny, Akshay Dharmavaram, Sang Uk Lee, Tung Phan-Minh, Shreyas Rajesh, Yunqing Hu, Laura Major, Momchil S. Tomov, Julie A. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-driving cars increasingly rely on deep neural networks to achieve human-like driving. However, the opacity of such black-box motion planners makes it challenging for the human behind the wheel to accurately anticipate when they will fail, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Here, we introduce concept-wrapper network (i.e., CW-Net), a method for explaining the behavior of black-box motion planners by grounding their reasoning in human-interpretable concepts. We deploy CW-Net on a real self-driving car and show that the resulting explanations refine the human driver's mental model of the car, allowing them to better predict its behavior and adjust their own behavior accordingly. Unlike previous work using toy domains or simulations, our study presents the first real-world demonstration of how to build authentic autonomous vehicles (AVs) that give interpretable, causally faithful explanations for their decisions, without sacrificing performance. We anticipate our method could be applied to other safety-critical systems with a human in the loop, such as autonomous drones and robotic surgeons. Overall, our study suggests a pathway to explainability for autonomous agents as a whole, which can help make them more transparent, their deployment safer, and their usage more ethical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Morales-Brotons, Grigorios Chrysos, Stratis Tzoumas, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised deep learning requires massive labeled datasets, but obtaining annotations is not always easy or possible, especially for dense tasks like semantic segmentation. To overcome this issue, numerous works explore Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), which uses a labeled dataset from another domain (source), or Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), which trains on a partially labeled set. Despite the success of UDA and SSL, reaching supervised performance at a low annotation cost remains a notoriously elusive goal. To address this, we study the promising setting of Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA). We propose a simple SSDA framework that combines consistency regularization, pixel contrastive learning, and self-training to effectively utilize a few target-domain labels. Our method outperforms prior art in the popular GTA-to-Cityscapes benchmark and shows that as little as 50 target labels can suffice to achieve near-supervised performance. Additional results on Synthia-to-Cityscapes, GTA-to-BDD and Synthia-to-BDD further demonstrate the effectiveness and practical utility of the method. Lastly, we find that existing UDA and SSL methods are not well-suited for the SSDA setting and discuss design patterns to adapt them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengwei Tian, Ravi Tandon</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring privacy during inference stage is crucial to prevent malicious third parties from reconstructing users' private inputs from outputs of public models. Despite a large body of literature on privacy preserving learning (which ensures privacy of training data), there is no existing systematic framework to ensure the privacy of users' data during inference. Motivated by this problem, we introduce the notion of Inference Privacy (IP), which can allow a user to interact with a model (for instance, a classifier, or an AI-assisted chat-bot) while providing a rigorous privacy guarantee for the users' data at inference. We establish fundamental properties of the IP privacy notion and also contrast it with the notion of Local Differential Privacy (LDP). We then present two types of mechanisms for achieving IP: namely, input perturbations and output perturbations which are customizable by the users and can allow them to navigate the trade-off between utility and privacy. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our framework via experiments and highlight the resulting trade-offs between utility and privacy during inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwook Kim, Aly Khalifa, Thomas G. Purdie, Chris McIntosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based automated contouring and treatment planning has been proven to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiotherapy. However, conventional radiotherapy treatment planning process has the automated contouring and treatment planning as separate tasks. Moreover in deep learning (DL), the contouring and dose prediction tasks for automated treatment planning are done independently. In this study, we applied the multi-task learning (MTL) approach in order to seamlessly integrate automated contouring and voxel-based dose prediction tasks, as MTL can leverage common information between the two tasks and be able able to increase the efficiency of the automated tasks. We developed our MTL framework using the two datasets: in-house prostate cancer dataset and the publicly available head and neck cancer dataset, OpenKBP. Compared to the sequential DL contouring and treatment planning tasks, our proposed method using MTL improved the mean absolute difference of dose volume histogram metrics of prostate and head and neck sites by 19.82% and 16.33%, respectively. Our MTL model for automated contouring and dose prediction tasks demonstrated enhanced dose prediction performance while maintaining or sometimes even improving the contouring accuracy. Compared to the baseline automated contouring model with the dice score coefficients of 0.818 for prostate and 0.674 for head and neck datasets, our MTL approach achieved average scores of 0.824 and 0.716 for these datasets, respectively. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed automated contouring and planning using MTL to support the development of efficient and accurate automated treatment planning for radiotherapy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangqi Li, Hieu Le, Jingyi Xu, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating realistic images from arbitrary text prompts. However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised \textit{Rel}ative \textit{Con}trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Chen, Matthew Gombolay</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ram Zaveri, Shivang Patel, Yu Gu, Gianfranco Doretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training. Also, it directly addresses OOD tracking generalization by including a fast backward-free dynamic test-time adaptation method that continuously adapts the model according to the dynamic visual changes of the target. Our extensive experiments suggest that SiamABC shows remarkable performance gains in OOD sets while maintaining accurate performance on the ID benchmarks. SiamABC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 7.6\% on the OOD AVisT benchmark while being 3x faster (100 FPS) on a CPU.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized various fields, but their deployment on GPUs often leads to significant energy consumption. Unlike existing methods for reducing GPU energy consumption, which are either hardware-inflexible or limited by workload constraints, this paper addresses the problem at the GPU kernel level. We propose a novel search-based compilation method to generate energy-efficient GPU kernels by incorporating energy efficiency into the search process. To accelerate the energy evaluation process, we develop an accurate energy cost model based on high-level kernel features. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic updating strategy for the energy cost model, reducing the need for on-device energy measurements and accelerating the search process. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach can generate GPU kernels with up to 21.69% reduced energy consumption while maintaining low latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) aims to support communication-impaired patients by translating neural signals into speech. A notable research topic in BCI involves Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that measure the electrical activity in the brain. While significant advancements have been made in BCI EEG research, a major limitation still exists: the scarcity of publicly available EEG datasets for non-English languages, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we introduce in this paper ArEEG_Words dataset, a novel EEG dataset recorded from 22 participants with mean age of 22 years (5 female, 17 male) using a 14-channel Emotiv Epoc X device. The participants were asked to be free from any effects on their nervous system, such as coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and so 8 hours before recording. They were asked to stay calm in a clam room during imagining one of the 16 Arabic Words for 10 seconds. The words include 16 commonly used words such as up, down, left, and right. A total of 352 EEG recordings were collected, then each recording was divided into multiple 250ms signals, resulting in a total of 15,360 EEG signals. To the best of our knowledge, ArEEG_Words data is the first of its kind in Arabic EEG domain. Moreover, it is publicly available for researchers as we hope that will fill the gap in Arabic EEG research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environments. Drawing from the foundations of trial and error, RL equips agents to make informed decisions through feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL, meticulously analyzing a wide range of algorithms, from foundational tabular methods to advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. We categorize and evaluate these algorithms based on key criteria such as scalability, sample efficiency, and suitability. We compare the methods in the form of their strengths and weaknesses in diverse settings. Additionally, we offer practical insights into the selection and implementation of RL algorithms, addressing common challenges like convergence, stability, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. This paper serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness the full potential of RL in solving complex, real-world problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings can be contaminated by electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when the monitored muscle is closed to the heart. Traditional signal-processing-based approaches, such as high-pass filtering and template subtraction, have been used to remove ECG interference but are often limited in their effectiveness. Recently, neural-network-based methods have shown greater promise for sEMG denoising, but they still struggle to balance both efficiency and effectiveness. In this study, we introduce MSEMG, a novel system that integrates the Mamba State Space Model with a convolutional neural network to serve as a lightweight sEMG denoising model. We evaluated MSEMG using sEMG data from the Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics database and ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The results show that MSEMG outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality sEMG signals with fewer parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakshi Agarwal, Gabe Hoope, Erik B. Sudderth</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models learn to remove noise that is artificially added to the data during training. Novel data, like images, may then be generated from Gaussian noise through a sequence of denoising operations. While this Markov process implicitly defines a joint distribution over noise-free data, it is not simple to condition the generative process on masked or partial images. A number of heuristic sampling procedures have been proposed for solving inverse problems with diffusion priors, but these approaches do not directly approximate the true conditional distribution imposed by inference queries, and are often ineffective for large masked regions. Moreover, many of these baselines cannot be applied to latent diffusion models which use image encodings for efficiency. We instead develop a hierarchical variational inference algorithm that analytically marginalizes missing features, and uses a rigorous variational bound to optimize a non-Gaussian Markov approximation of the true diffusion posterior. Through extensive experiments with both pixel-based and latent diffusion models of images, we show that our VIPaint method significantly outperforms previous approaches in both the plausibility and diversity of imputations, and is easily generalized to other inverse problems like deblurring and superresolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancheng Zhang, Peiran Dong, Yongyong Chen, Yin-Ping Zhao, Song Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have gained great attention in adversarial purification. Current diffusion-based works focus on designing effective condition-guided mechanisms while ignoring a fundamental problem, i.e., the original DDPM sampling is intended for stable generation, which may not be the optimal solution for adversarial purification. Inspired by the stability of the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM), we propose an opposite sampling scheme called random sampling. In brief, random sampling will sample from a random noisy space during each diffusion process, while DDPM and DDIM sampling will continuously sample from the adjacent or original noisy space. Thus, random sampling obtains more randomness and achieves stronger robustness against adversarial attacks. Correspondingly, we also introduce a novel mediator conditional guidance to guarantee the consistency of the prediction under the purified image and clean image input. To expand awareness of guided diffusion purification, we conduct a detailed evaluation with different sampling methods and our random sampling achieves an impressive improvement in multiple settings. Leveraging mediator-guided random sampling, we also establish a baseline method named DiffAP, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in performance and defensive stability. Remarkably, under strong attack, our DiffAP even achieves a more than 20% robustness advantage with 10$\times$ sampling acceleration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Bhan, Peijia Qin, Miroslav Krstic, Yuanyuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes. These numerical schemes, typically combining finite difference and successive approximations, become computationally prohibitive when the dynamics of the system are expensive to compute. To alleviate this issue, we propose approximating the predictor mapping via a neural operator. In particular, we introduce a new perspective on predictor designs by recasting the predictor formulation as an operator learning problem. We then prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated-predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - namely, one can increase the set of initial states as large as desired but this will naturally increase the difficulty of training a neural operator approximation which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, we emphasize that our result holds not just for neural operators, but any black-box predictor satisfying a universal approximation error bound. From a computational perspective, the advantage of the neural operator approach is clear as it requires training once, offline and then is deployed with very little computational cost in the feedback controller. We conduct experiments controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different state-of-the-art neural operator architectures demonstrating speedups on the magnitude of $10^2$ compared to traditional predictor approximation schemes.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the phase retrieval problem, the aim is the recovery of an unknown image from intensity-only measurements such as Fourier intensity. Although there are several solution approaches, solving this problem is challenging due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature. Recently, learning-based approaches have emerged as powerful alternatives to the analytical methods for several inverse problems. In the context of phase retrieval, a novel plug-and-play approach that exploits learning-based prior and e!cient update steps has been presented at the Computational Optical Sensing and Imaging topical meeting, with demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. The key idea was to incorporate learning-based prior to the hybrid input-output method (HIO) through plug-and-play regularization. In this paper, we present the mathematical development of the method including the derivation of its analytical update steps based on half-quadratic splitting and comparatively evaluate its performance through extensive simulations on a large test dataset. The results show the e"ectiveness of the method in terms of both image quality, computational e!ciency, and robustness to initialization and noise.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-annotated content is often used to train machine learning (ML) models. However, recently, language and multi-modal foundational models have been used to replace and scale-up human annotator's efforts. This study compares human-generated and ML-generated annotations of images representing diverse socio-economic contexts. We aim to understand differences in perception and identify potential biases in content interpretation. Our dataset comprises images of people from various geographical regions and income levels washing their hands. We compare human and ML-generated annotations semantically and evaluate their impact on predictive models. Our results show low similarity between human and machine annotations from a low-level perspective, i.e., types of words that appear and sentence structures, but are alike in how similar or dissimilar they perceive images across different regions. Additionally, human annotations resulted in best overall and most balanced region classification performance on the class level, while ML Objects and ML Captions performed best for income regression. Humans and machines' similarity in their lack of bias when perceiving images highlights how they are more alike than what was initially perceived. The superior and fairer performance of using human annotations for region classification and machine annotations for income regression show how important the quality of the images and the discriminative features in the annotations are.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susmita Das, Arpita Dutta, Kingshuk Roy, Abir Mondal, Arnab Mukhopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: The expanding influence of social media platforms over the past decade has impacted the way people communicate. The level of obscurity provided by social media and easy accessibility of the internet has facilitated the spread of hate speech. The terms and expressions related to hate speech gets updated with changing times which poses an obstacle to policy-makers and researchers in case of hate speech identification. With growing number of individuals using their native languages to communicate with each other, hate speech in these low-resource languages are also growing. Although, there is awareness about the English-related approaches, much attention have not been provided to these low-resource languages due to lack of datasets and online available data. This article provides a detailed survey of hate speech detection in low-resource languages around the world with details of available datasets, features utilized and techniques used. This survey further discusses the prevailing surveys, overlapping concepts related to hate speech, research challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Ganon, Alon Zolfi, Omer Hofman, Inderjeet Singh, Hisashi Kojima, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, conversational large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in tasks such as casual conversation, question answering, and personalized dialogue, making significant advancements in domains like virtual assistance, social interaction, and online customer engagement. However, they often generate responses that are not aligned with human values (e.g., ethical standards, safety, or social norms), leading to potentially unsafe or inappropriate outputs. While several techniques have been proposed to address this problem, they come with a cost, requiring computationally expensive training or dramatically increasing the inference time. In this paper, we present DIESEL, a lightweight inference guidance technique that can be seamlessly integrated into any autoregressive LLM to semantically filter undesired concepts from the response. DIESEL can function either as a standalone safeguard or as an additional layer of defense, enhancing response safety by reranking the LLM's proposed tokens based on their similarity to predefined negative concepts in the latent space. This approach provides an efficient and effective solution for maintaining alignment with human values. Our evaluation demonstrates DIESEL's effectiveness on state-of-the-art conversational models (e.g., Llama 3), even in challenging jailbreaking scenarios that test the limits of response safety. We further show that DIESEL can be generalized to use cases other than safety, providing a versatile solution for general-purpose response filtering with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dazhuang Liu, Yanqi Qiao, Rui Wang, Kaitai Liang, Georgios Smaragdakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Current black-box backdoor attacks in convolutional neural networks formulate attack objective(s) as single-objective optimization problems in single domain. Designing triggers in single domain harms semantics and trigger robustness as well as introduces visual and spectral anomaly. This work proposes a multi-objective black-box backdoor attack in dual domains via evolutionary algorithm (LADDER), the first instance of achieving multiple attack objectives simultaneously by optimizing triggers without requiring prior knowledge about victim model. In particular, we formulate LADDER as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) and solve it via multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). MOEA maintains a population of triggers with trade-offs among attack objectives and uses non-dominated sort to drive triggers toward optimal solutions. We further apply preference-based selection to MOEA to exclude impractical triggers. We state that LADDER investigates a new dual-domain perspective for trigger stealthiness by minimizing the anomaly between clean and poisoned samples in the spectral domain. Lastly, the robustness against preprocessing operations is achieved by pushing triggers to low-frequency regions. Extensive experiments comprehensively showcase that LADDER achieves attack effectiveness of at least 99%, attack robustness with 90.23% (50.09% higher than state-of-the-art attacks on average), superior natural stealthiness (1.12x to 196.74x improvement) and excellent spectral stealthiness (8.45x enhancement) as compared to current stealthy attacks by the average $l_2$-norm across 5 public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conrad Borchers, Ryan S. Baker</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic bias continues to be a key concern of learning analytics. We study the statistical properties of the Absolute Between-ROC Area (ABROCA) metric. This fairness measure quantifies group-level differences in classifier performance through the absolute difference in ROC curves. ABROCA is particularly useful for detecting nuanced performance differences even when overall Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values are similar. We sample ABROCA under various conditions, including varying AUC differences and class distributions. We find that ABROCA distributions exhibit high skewness dependent on sample sizes, AUC differences, and class imbalance. When assessing whether a classifier is biased, this skewness inflates ABROCA values by chance, even when data is drawn (by simulation) from populations with equivalent ROC curves. These findings suggest that ABROCA requires careful interpretation given its distributional properties, especially when used to assess the degree of bias and when classes are imbalanced.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Othmane Echchabi, Nizar Talty, Josh Manto, Aya Lahlou, Ka Leung Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Clean water and sanitation are essential for health, well-being, and sustainable development, yet significant global disparities remain. Although the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 has clear targets for universal access to clean water and sanitation, data coverage and openness remain obstacles for tracking progress in many countries. Nontraditional data sources are needed to fill this gap. This study incorporated Afrobarometer survey data, satellite imagery (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2), and deep learning techniques (Meta's DINO model) to develop a modelling framework for evaluating access to piped water and sewage systems across diverse African regions. The modelling framework demonstrated high accuracy, achieving over 96% and 97% accuracy in identifying areas with piped water access and sewage system access respectively using satellite imagery. It can serve as a screening tool for policymakers and stakeholders to potentially identify regions for more targeted and prioritized efforts to improve water and sanitation infrastructure. When coupled with spatial population data, the modelling framework can also estimate and track the national-level percentages of the population with access to piped water and sewage systems. In the future, this approach could potentially be extended to evaluate other SDGs, particularly those related to critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Abstract: NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) is a feature that enables system designers to reconfigure one large GPU into multiple smaller GPU slices. This work characterizes this emerging GPU and evaluates its effectiveness in designing high-performance AI inference servers. Our study reveals that the data preprocessing stage of AI inference causes significant performance bottlenecks to MIG. To this end, we present PREBA, which is a hardware/software co-design targeting MIG inference servers. Our first proposition is an FPGA-based data preprocessing accelerator that unlocks the full potential of MIG with domain-specific acceleration of data preprocessing. The MIG inference server unleashed from preprocessing overheads is then augmented with our dynamic batching system that enables high-performance inference. PREBA is implemented end-to-end in real systems, providing a 3.7x improvement in throughput, 3.4x reduction in tail latency, 3.5x improvement in energy-efficiency, and 3.0x improvement in cost-efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaco du Toit, Herman Redelinghuys, Marcel Dunaiski</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task with the objective to classify text documents into a set of classes from a structured class hierarchy. Many HTC approaches have been proposed which attempt to leverage the class hierarchy information in various ways to improve classification performance. Machine learning-based classification approaches require large amounts of training data and are most-commonly compared through three established benchmark datasets, which include the Web Of Science (WOS), Reuters Corpus Volume 1 Version 2 (RCV1-V2) and New York Times (NYT) datasets. However, apart from the RCV1-V2 dataset which is well-documented, these datasets are not accompanied with detailed description methodologies. In this paper, we introduce three new HTC benchmark datasets in the domain of research publications which comprise the titles and abstracts of papers from the Web of Science publication database. We first create two baseline datasets which use existing journal-and citation-based classification schemas. Due to the respective shortcomings of these two existing schemas, we propose an approach which combines their classifications to improve the reliability and robustness of the dataset. We evaluate the three created datasets with a clustering-based analysis and show that our proposed approach results in a higher quality dataset where documents that belong to the same class are semantically more similar compared to the other datasets. Finally, we provide the classification performance of four state-of-the-art HTC approaches on these three new datasets to provide baselines for future studies on machine learning-based techniques for scientific publication classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oriol Corcoll Andreu, Athanasios Vlontzos, Michael O'Riordan, Ciaran M. Gilligan-Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal effects is vital for decision making. In standard causal effect estimation, treatments are usually binary- or continuous-valued. However, in many important real-world settings, treatments can be structured, high-dimensional objects, such as text, video, or audio. This provides a challenge to traditional causal effect estimation. While leveraging the shared structure across different treatments can help generalize to unseen treatments at test time, we show in this paper that using such structure blindly can lead to biased causal effect estimation. We address this challenge by devising a novel contrastive approach to learn a representation of the high-dimensional treatments, and prove that it identifies underlying causal factors and discards non-causally relevant factors. We prove that this treatment representation leads to unbiased estimates of the causal effect, and empirically validate and benchmark our results on synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Vaidhyanathan, Florian Marquardt, Mark T. Mitchison, Natalia Ares</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through a supervised learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes well to the control of non-Markovian systems. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Most of current computer vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) perform detection and tracking of objects quite successfully under regular conditions. However, under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, and in complex situations with many overlapping objects, these systems are not completely reliable. The spectral reflectance of the different objects in a driving scene beyond the visible spectrum can offer additional information to increase the reliability of these systems, especially under challenging driving conditions. Furthermore, this information may be significant enough to develop vision systems that allow for a better understanding and interpretation of the whole driving scene. In this work we explore the use of snapshot, video-rate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cameras in ADAS on the assumption that the near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance of different materials can help to better segment the objects in real driving scenarios. To do this, we have used the HSI-Drive 1.1 dataset to perform various experiments on spectral classification algorithms. However, the information retrieval of hyperspectral recordings in natural outdoor scenarios is challenging, mainly because of deficient colour constancy and other inherent shortcomings of current snapshot HSI technology, which poses some limitations to the development of pure spectral classifiers. In consequence, in this work we analyze to what extent the spatial features codified by standard, tiny fully convolutional network (FCN) models can improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems for ADAS applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berta Casas, Xavier Bonet-Monroig, Adri\'an P\'erez-Salinas</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has surged as a prominent area of research with the objective to go beyond the capabilities of classical machine learning models. A critical aspect of any learning task is the process of data embedding, which directly impacts model performance. Poorly designed data-embedding strategies can significantly impact the success of a learning task. Despite its importance, rigorous analyses of data-embedding effects are limited, leaving many cases without effective assessment methods. In this work, we introduce a metric for binary classification tasks, the class margin, by merging the concepts of average randomness and classification margin. This metric analytically connects data-induced randomness with classification accuracy for a given data-embedding map. We benchmark a range of data-embedding strategies through class margin, demonstrating that data-induced randomness imposes a limit on classification performance. We expect this work to provide a new approach to evaluate QML models by their data-embedding processes, addressing gaps left by existing analytical tools.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19297">Enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision Transformers through Frequency-Based Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Son Thai Ly, Hien V. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting vision transformer foundation models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods has become increasingly popular. These methods optimize a limited subset of parameters, enabling efficient adaptation without the need to fine-tune the entire model while still achieving competitive performance. However, traditional PEFT methods may limit the model's capacity to capture complex patterns, especially those associated with high-frequency spectra. This limitation becomes particularly problematic as existing research indicates that high-frequency features are crucial for distinguishing subtle image structures. To address this issue, we introduce FreqFit, a novel Frequency Fine-tuning module between ViT blocks to enhance model adaptability. FreqFit is simple yet surprisingly effective, and can be integrated with all existing PEFT methods to boost their performance. By manipulating features in the frequency domain, our approach allows models to capture subtle patterns more effectively. Extensive experiments on 24 datasets, using both supervised and self-supervised foundational models with various state-of-the-art PEFT methods, reveal that FreqFit consistently improves performance over the original PEFT methods with performance gains ranging from 1% to 16%. For instance, FreqFit-LoRA surpasses the performances of state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR100 by more than 10% even without applying regularization or strong augmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anamaria Mojica-Hanke, David Nader Palacio, Denys Poshyvanyk, Mario Linares-V\'asquez, Steffen Herbold</p>
<p>Abstract: Context: Machine Learning (ML) significantly impacts Software Engineering (SE), but studies mainly focus on practitioners, neglecting researchers. This overlooks practices and challenges in teaching, researching, or reviewing ML applications in SE.
  Objective: This study aims to contribute to the knowledge, about the synergy between ML and SE from the perspective of SE researchers, by providing insights into the practices followed when researching, teaching, and reviewing SE studies that apply ML.
  Method: We analyzed SE researchers familiar with ML or who authored SE articles using ML, along with the articles themselves. We examined practices, SE tasks addressed with ML, challenges faced, and reviewers' and educators' perspectives using grounded theory coding and qualitative analysis.
  Results: We found diverse practices focusing on data collection, model training, and evaluation. Some recommended practices (e.g., hyperparameter tuning) appeared in less than 20\% of literature. Common challenges involve data handling, model evaluation (incl. non-functional properties), and involving human expertise in evaluation. Hands-on activities are common in education, though traditional methods persist.
  Conclusion: Despite accepted practices in applying ML to SE, significant gaps remain. By enhancing guidelines, adopting diverse teaching methods, and emphasizing underrepresented practices, the SE community can bridge these gaps and advance the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengpeng Xiao, Phillip Si, Peng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Data assimilation techniques are crucial for correcting the trajectory when modeling complex physical systems. A recently developed data assimilation method, Latent Ensemble Score Filter (Latent-EnSF), has shown great promise in addressing the key limitation of EnSF for highly sparse observations in high-dimensional and nonlinear data assimilation problems. It performs data assimilation in a latent space for encoded states and observations in every assimilation step, and requires costly full dynamics to be evolved in the original space. In this paper, we introduce Latent Dynamics EnSF (LD-EnSF), a novel methodology that completely avoids the full dynamics evolution and significantly accelerates the data assimilation process, which is especially valuable for complex dynamical problems that require fast data assimilation in real time. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel variant of Latent Dynamics Networks (LDNets) to effectively capture and preserve the system's dynamics within a very low-dimensional latent space. Additionally, we propose a new method for encoding sparse observations into the latent space using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which leverage not only the current step's observations, as in Latent-EnSF, but also all previous steps, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of the observation encoding. We demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for two challenging dynamical systems with highly sparse (in both space and time) and noisy observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhang, Kaiyuan Zheng, Zhaorun Chen, Joel Jang, Yi Li, Chaoqi Wang, Mingyu Ding, Dieter Fox, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the recent advancements of vision-language-action (VLA) models on a variety of robotics tasks, they suffer from critical issues such as poor generalizability to unseen tasks, due to their reliance on behavior cloning exclusively from successful rollouts. Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 60.36%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 44.31% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sima Soltanpour, Arnold Chang, Dan Madularu, Praveen Kulkarni, Craig Ferris, Chris Joslin</p>
<p>Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is extensively used in clinical and preclinical settings to study brain function, however, fMRI data is inherently noisy due to physiological processes, hardware, and external noise. Denoising is one of the main preprocessing steps in any fMRI analysis pipeline. This process is challenging in preclinical data in comparison to clinical data due to variations in brain geometry, image resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserved algorithm based on a 3D Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a 3D dense U-net based discriminator called, 3D U-WGAN. We apply a 4D data configuration to effectively denoise temporal and spatial information in analyzing preclinical fMRI data. GAN-based denoising methods often utilize a discriminator to identify significant differences between denoised and noise-free images, focusing on global or local features. To refine the fMRI denoising model, our method employs a 3D dense U-Net discriminator to learn both global and local distinctions. To tackle potential over-smoothing, we introduce an adversarial loss and enhance perceptual similarity by measuring feature space distances. Experiments illustrate that 3D U-WGAN significantly improves image quality in resting-state and task preclinical fMRI data, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio without introducing excessive structural changes in existing methods. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to simulated and real data in a fMRI analysis pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Fazli Imam, Rufael Fedaku Marew, Jameel Hassan, Mustansar Fiaz, Alham Fikri Aji, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of foundation models, CLIP has emerged as a powerful tool for aligning text and visual modalities into a common embedding space. However, the alignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features for fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at extracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm. Yet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step, which relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method that leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models (DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to largely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled images. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual feature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging class-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot classification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These textual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment module that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based textual embeddings and DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune CLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained alignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of visual and textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient approach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods. Notably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute gain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFter across 11 diverse image classification datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test is a general task used to assess language models' (LMs') abilities to recall particular information from long input context. This framework however does not provide a means of analyzing what factors, beyond context length, contribute to LMs' abilities or inabilities to separate and recall needles from their haystacks. To provide a systematic means of assessing what features contribute to LMs' NIAH capabilities, we developed a synthetic benchmark called DENIAHL (Data-oriented Evaluation of NIAH for LLM's). Our work expands on previous NIAH studies by ablating NIAH features beyond typical context length including data type, size, and patterns. We find stark differences between GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 2-7B's performance on DENIAHL, and drops in recall performance when features like item size are increased, and to some degree when data type is changed from numbers to letters. This has implications for increasingly large context models, demonstrating factors beyond item-number impact NIAH capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of phase transitions is a central task in many-body physics. To automate this process, the task can be phrased as a classification problem. Classification problems can be approached in two fundamentally distinct ways: through either a discriminative or a generative method. In general, it is unclear which of these two approaches is most suitable for a given problem. The choice is expected to depend on factors such as the availability of system knowledge, dataset size, desired accuracy, computational resources, and other considerations. In this work, we answer the question of how one should approach the solution of phase-classification problems by performing a numerical case study on the thermal phase transition in the classical two-dimensional square-lattice ferromagnetic Ising model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Ding, Alexander Lerch</p>
<p>Abstract: More music foundation models are recently being released, promising a general, mostly task independent encoding of musical information. Common ways of adapting music foundation models to downstream tasks are probing and fine-tuning. These common transfer learning approaches, however, face challenges. Probing might lead to suboptimal performance because the pre-trained weights are frozen, while fine-tuning is computationally expensive and is prone to overfitting. Our work investigates the use of parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for music foundation models which integrates the advantage of probing and fine-tuning. We introduce three types of PETL methods: adapter-based methods, prompt-based methods, and reparameterization-based methods. These methods train only a small number of parameters, and therefore do not require significant computational resources. Results show that PETL methods outperform both probing and fine-tuning on music auto-tagging. On key detection and tempo estimation, they achieve similar results as fine-tuning with significantly less training cost. However, the usefulness of the current generation of foundation model on key and tempo tasks is questioned by the similar results achieved by training a small model from scratch.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) is a challenging task, as it requires a thorough understanding of medical images, integration of multiple temporal inputs, and accurate report generation. Effective interpretation of medical images, such as chest X-rays (CXRs), demands sophisticated visual-language reasoning to map visual findings to structured reports. Recent studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities by aligning with pre-trained vision encoders. However, current approaches predominantly focus on single-image analysis or utilise rule-based symbolic processing to handle multiple images, thereby overlooking the essential temporal information derived from comparing current images with prior ones. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce Libra, a temporal-aware MLLM tailored for CXR report generation using temporal images. Libra integrates a radiology-specific image encoder with a MLLM and utilises a novel Temporal Alignment Connector to capture and synthesise temporal information of images across different time points with unprecedented precision. Extensive experiments show that Libra achieves new state-of-the-art performance among the same parameter scale MLLMs for RRG tasks on the MIMIC-CXR. Specifically, Libra improves the RadCliQ metric by 12.9% and makes substantial gains across all lexical metrics compared to previous models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Pan, Zhuang Wang, Zhen Jia, Can Karakus, Luca Zancato, Tri Dao, Ravi Netravali, Yida Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shwetha Ram, Tal Neiman, Qianli Feng, Andrew Stuart, Son Tran, Trishul Chilimbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a small number of images of a subject, personalized image generation techniques can fine-tune large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to generate images of the subject in novel contexts, conditioned on text prompts. In doing so, a trade-off is made between prompt fidelity, subject fidelity and diversity. As the pre-trained model is fine-tuned, earlier checkpoints synthesize images with low subject fidelity but high prompt fidelity and diversity. In contrast, later checkpoints generate images with low prompt fidelity and diversity but high subject fidelity. This inherent trade-off limits the prompt fidelity, subject fidelity and diversity of generated images. In this work, we propose DreamBlend to combine the prompt fidelity from earlier checkpoints and the subject fidelity from later checkpoints during inference. We perform a cross attention guided image synthesis from a later checkpoint, guided by an image generated by an earlier checkpoint, for the same prompt. This enables generation of images with better subject fidelity, prompt fidelity and diversity on challenging prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly crucial for the scalability of robotics tasks and dataset generation diversity. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide an early theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritam Majumdar, Jack Teversham, Sonali Parbhoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating off-policy decisions using batch data poses significant challenges due to limited sample sizes leading to high variance. To improve Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE), we must identify and address the sources of this variance. Recent research on Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) shows that using human-explainable concepts can improve predictions and provide better understanding. We propose incorporating concepts into OPE to reduce variance. Our work introduces a family of concept-based OPE estimators, proving that they remain unbiased and reduce variance when concepts are known and predefined. Since real-world applications often lack predefined concepts, we further develop an end-to-end algorithm to learn interpretable, concise, and diverse parameterized concepts optimized for variance reduction. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show that both known and learned concept-based estimators significantly improve OPE performance. Crucially, we show that, unlike other OPE methods, concept-based estimators are easily interpretable and allow for targeted interventions on specific concepts, further enhancing the quality of these estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixi Hu, Keyang Xu, Bo Liu, Qiang Liu, Hongliang Fei</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios Karageorgiou, Symeon Papadopoulos, Ioannis Kompatsiaris, Efstratios Gavves</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Li, Kai Zhao, Yaqi Wang, Shuai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical image analysis, achieving fast, efficient, and accurate segmentation is essential for automated diagnosis and treatment. Although recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved segmentation accuracy, current models often face challenges in adaptability and generalization, particularly when processing multi-modal medical imaging data. These limitations stem from the substantial variations between imaging modalities and the inherent complexity of medical data. To address these challenges, we propose the Strategy-driven Interactive Segmentation Model (SISeg), built on SAM2, which enhances segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities by integrating a selection engine. To mitigate memory bottlenecks and optimize prompt frame selection during the inference of 2D image sequences, we developed an automated system, the Adaptive Frame Selection Engine (AFSE). This system dynamically selects the optimal prompt frames without requiring extensive prior medical knowledge and enhances the interpretability of the model's inference process through an interactive feedback mechanism. We conducted extensive experiments on 10 datasets covering 7 representative medical imaging modalities, demonstrating the SISeg model's robust adaptability and generalization in multi-modal tasks. The project page and code will be available at: [URL].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Fayad</p>
<p>Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a powerful probe of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze GW time-series data. By training on noise-only data, the VAE accurately reconstructs noise inputs while failing to reconstruct anomalies, such as GW signals, which results in measurable spikes in the reconstruction error. The method was applied to data from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. Evaluation on testing datasets containing both noise and GW events demonstrated reliable detection, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. This study introduces VAEs as a robust, unsupervised approach for identifying anomalies in GW data, which offers a scalable framework for detecting known and potentially new phenomena in physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Zhao, Chang Xu, Bailu Si</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual abstract reasoning tasks present challenges for deep neural networks, exposing limitations in their capabilities. In this work, we present a neural network model that addresses the challenges posed by Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Inspired by the two-stream hypothesis of visual processing, we introduce the Dual-stream Reasoning Network (DRNet), which utilizes two parallel branches to capture image features. On top of the two streams, a reasoning module first learns to merge the high-level features of the same image. Then, it employs a rule extractor to handle combinations involving the eight context images and each candidate image, extracting discrete abstract rules and utilizing an multilayer perceptron (MLP) to make predictions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed DRNet achieves state-of-the-art average performance across multiple RPM benchmarks. Furthermore, DRNet demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, even extending to various out-of-distribution scenarios. The dual streams within DRNet serve distinct functions by addressing local or spatial information. They are then integrated into the reasoning module, leveraging abstract rules to facilitate the execution of visual reasoning tasks. These findings indicate that the dual-stream architecture could play a crucial role in visual abstract reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zhang, Yuan Zhou, Zeyu Liu, Yuxuan Cai, Qiuyue Wang, Aidong Men, Huan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for generating human motion videos rely on extracting pose sequences from reference videos, which restricts flexibility and control. Additionally, due to the limitations of pose detection techniques, the extracted pose sequences can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to low-quality video outputs. We introduce a novel task aimed at generating human motion videos solely from reference images and natural language. This approach offers greater flexibility and ease of use, as text is more accessible than the desired guidance videos. However, training an end-to-end model for this task requires millions of high-quality text and human motion video pairs, which are challenging to obtain. To address this, we propose a new framework called Fleximo, which leverages large-scale pre-trained text-to-3D motion models. This approach is not straightforward, as the text-generated skeletons may not consistently match the scale of the reference image and may lack detailed information. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an anchor point based rescale method and design a skeleton adapter to fill in missing details and bridge the gap between text-to-motion and motion-to-video generation. We also propose a video refinement process to further enhance video quality. A large language model (LLM) is employed to decompose natural language into discrete motion sequences, enabling the generation of motion videos of any desired length. To assess the performance of Fleximo, we introduce a new benchmark called MotionBench, which includes 400 videos across 20 identities and 20 motions. We also propose a new metric, MotionScore, to evaluate the accuracy of motion following. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-conditioned image-to-video generation methods. All code and model weights will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing scale and complexity of video data, efficiently processing long video sequences poses significant challenges due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational demands associated with existing transformer-based Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). To address these issues, we introduce Video-Ma$^2$mba, a novel architecture that incorporates State Space Models (SSMs) within the Mamba-2 framework, replacing the attention mechanisms. This allows the LMMs to scale linearly in terms of time and memory requirements, making it feasible to handle long-duration video content. Furthermore, we enhance the memory efficiency introducing the Multi-Axis Gradient Checkpointing (MA-GC) method, which strategically manages memory by retaining only essential activations across multiple computational axes. Our approach significantly reduces the memory footprint compared to standard gradient checkpointing. Empirical analyses show that Video-Ma$^2$mba can process extensive video sequences-equivalent to millions of tokens or over two hours of continuous sequences at 1 FPS-on a single GPU. By maintaining a detailed capture of temporal dynamics, our model improves the accuracy and relevance of responses in long video understanding tasks, demonstrating substantial advantages over existing frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D surface reconstruction is essential across applications of virtual reality, robotics, and mobile scanning. However, RGB-based reconstruction often fails in low-texture, low-light, and low-albedo scenes. Handheld LiDARs, now common on mobile devices, aim to address these challenges by capturing depth information from time-of-flight measurements of a coarse grid of projected dots. Yet, these sparse LiDARs struggle with scene coverage on limited input views, leaving large gaps in depth information. In this work, we propose using an alternative class of "blurred" LiDAR that emits a diffuse flash, greatly improving scene coverage but introducing spatial ambiguity from mixed time-of-flight measurements across a wide field of view. To handle these ambiguities, we propose leveraging the complementary strengths of diffuse LiDAR with RGB. We introduce a Gaussian surfel-based rendering framework with a scene-adaptive loss function that dynamically balances RGB and diffuse LiDAR signals. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, diffuse LiDAR can outperform traditional sparse LiDAR, enabling robust 3D scanning with accurate color and geometry estimation in challenging environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Galaxy morphology analysis involves classifying galaxies by their shapes and structures. For this task, directly training domain-specific models on large, annotated astronomical datasets is effective but costly. In contrast, fine-tuning vision foundation models on a smaller set of astronomical images is more resource-efficient but generally results in lower accuracy. To harness the benefits of both approaches and address their shortcomings, we propose GalaxAlign, a novel method that fine-tunes pre-trained foundation models to achieve high accuracy on astronomical tasks. Specifically, our method extends a contrastive learning architecture to align three types of data in fine-tuning: (1) a set of schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2) textual labels of these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. This way, GalaxAlign not only eliminates the need for expensive pretraining but also enhances the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on galaxy classification and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating domain-specific multi-modal knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a general two-stage algorithm that enjoys a provable scaling law for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). Given an input problem, the proposed algorithm first generates $N$ candidate solutions, and then chooses the best one via a multiple-round knockout tournament where each pair of candidates are compared for $K$ times and only the winners move on to the next round. In a minimalistic implementation, both stages can be executed with a black-box LLM alone and nothing else (e.g., no external verifier or reward model), and a total of $N \times (K + 1)$ highly parallelizable LLM calls are needed for solving an input problem. Assuming that a generated candidate solution is correct with probability $p_{\text{gen}} > 0$ and a comparison between a pair of correct and incorrect solutions identifies the right winner with probability $p_{\text{comp}} > 0.5$ (i.e., better than a random guess), we prove theoretically that the failure probability of the proposed algorithm decays to zero exponentially with respect to $N$ and $K$: $$\mathbb{P}(\text{final output is incorrect}) \le (1 - p_{\text{gen}})^N + \lceil \log_2 N \rceil e^{-2 K (p_{\text{comp}} - 0.5)^2}.$$ Our empirical results with the challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark validate the technical assumptions, as well as the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and the gains from scaling up its test-time compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linshan Hou, Wei Luo, Zhongyun Hua, Songhua Chen, Leo Yu Zhang, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge and difficulties in building function workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of Tool-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring that the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by feeding the user-provided parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Gao, Yongqi Li, Ziqiang Cao, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to produce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their text-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the original image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal Chain-of-Thought, named \textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)}, which generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and textual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT requires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal content, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the required visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose \textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs. ADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the interleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies solely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and therefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum of VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different architectures. Extensive evaluations of three benchmarks have shown that ICoT prompting achieves substantial performance (up to 14\%) and interpretability improvements compared to existing multimodal CoT prompting methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qirui Wu, Denys Iliash, Daniel Ritchie, Manolis Savva, Angel X. Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing structured 3D scenes from RGB images using CAD objects unlocks efficient and compact scene representations that maintain compositionality and interactability. Existing works propose training-heavy methods relying on either expensive yet inaccurate real-world annotations or controllable yet monotonous synthetic data that do not generalize well to unseen objects or domains. We present Diorama, the first zero-shot open-world system that holistically models 3D scenes from single-view RGB observations without requiring end-to-end training or human annotations. We show the feasibility of our approach by decomposing the problem into subtasks and introduce robust, generalizable solutions to each: architecture reconstruction, 3D shape retrieval, object pose estimation, and scene layout optimization. We evaluate our system on both synthetic and real-world data to show we significantly outperform baselines from prior work. We also demonstrate generalization to internet images and the text-to-scene task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yuan, Yan Qiao, Zhenchun Wei, Zeyu Zhang, Minyue Li, Pei Zhao, Rongyao Hu, Wenjing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to network operation and maintenance relying heavily on network traffic monitoring, traffic matrix analysis has been one of the most crucial issues for network management related tasks. However, it is challenging to reliably obtain the precise measurement in computer networks because of the high measurement cost, and the unavoidable transmission loss. Although some methods proposed in recent years allowed estimating network traffic from partial flow-level or link-level measurements, they often perform poorly for traffic matrix estimation nowadays. Despite strong assumptions like low-rank structure and the prior distribution, existing techniques are usually task-specific and tend to be significantly worse as modern network communication is extremely complicated and dynamic. To address the dilemma, this paper proposed a diffusion-based traffic matrix analysis framework named Diffusion-TM, which leverages problem-agnostic diffusion to notably elevate the estimation performance in both traffic distribution and accuracy. The novel framework not only takes advantage of the powerful generative ability of diffusion models to produce realistic network traffic, but also leverages the denoising process to unbiasedly estimate all end-to-end traffic in a plug-and-play manner under theoretical guarantee. Moreover, taking into account that compiling an intact traffic dataset is usually infeasible, we also propose a two-stage training scheme to make our framework be insensitive to missing values in the dataset. With extensive experiments with real-world datasets, we illustrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-TM on several tasks. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that our method can obtain promising results even with $5\%$ known values left in the datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces SANGO (Socially Aware Navigation through Grouped Obstacles), a novel method that ensures socially appropriate behavior by dynamically grouping obstacles and adhering to social norms. Using deep reinforcement learning, SANGO trains agents to navigate complex environments leveraging the DBSCAN algorithm for obstacle clustering and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for path planning. The proposed approach improves safety and social compliance by maintaining appropriate distances and reducing collision rates. Extensive experiments conducted in custom simulation environments demonstrate SANGO's superior performance in significantly reducing discomfort (by up to 83.5%), reducing collision rates (by up to 29.4%) and achieving higher successful navigation in dynamic and crowded scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of SANGO for real-world applications, paving the way for advanced socially adept robotic navigation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lubin Meng, Xue Jiang, Tianwang Jia, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the preferred input signal in non-invasive BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. EEG-based BCIs have been successfully used in many applications, such as neurological rehabilitation, text input, games, and so on. However, EEG signals inherently carry rich personal information, necessitating privacy protection. This paper demonstrates that multiple types of private information (user identity, gender, and BCI-experience) can be easily inferred from EEG data, imposing a serious privacy threat to BCIs. To address this issue, we design perturbations to convert the original EEG data into privacy-protected EEG data, which conceal the private information while maintaining the primary BCI task performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the privacy-protected EEG data can significantly reduce the classification accuracy of user identity, gender and BCI-experience, but almost do not affect at all the classification accuracy of the primary BCI task, enabling user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Ashutosh Modi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, including arithmetic and reasoning; however, to gauge the intellectual capabilities of LLMs, causal reasoning has become a reliable proxy for validating a general understanding of the mechanics and intricacies of the world similar to humans. Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (~ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans. We further explore (the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs) using the backdoor criterion to determine the causal strength between events.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the preparation, deployment, and testing of an autoencoder trained for unbiased detection of new physics signatures in the CMS experiment Global Trigger (GT) test crate FPGAs during LHC Run 3. The GT makes the final decision whether to readout or discard the data from each LHC collision, which occur at a rate of 40 MHz, within a 50 ns latency. The Neural Network makes a prediction for each event within these constraints, which can be used to select anomalous events for further analysis. The GT test crate is a copy of the main GT system, receiving the same input data, but whose output is not used to trigger the readout of CMS, providing a platform for thorough testing of new trigger algorithms on live data, but without interrupting data taking. We describe the methodology to achieve ultra low latency anomaly detection, and present the integration of the DNN into the GT test crate, as well as the monitoring, testing, and validation of the algorithm during proton collisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Li, Ruobing Zheng, Minghui Yang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized audio-driven talking head synthesis. Beyond precise lip synchronization, diffusion-based methods excel in generating subtle expressions and natural head movements that are well-aligned with the audio signal. However, these methods are confronted by slow inference speed, insufficient fine-grained control over facial motions, and occasional visual artifacts largely due to an implicit latent space derived from Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which prevent their adoption in realtime interaction applications. To address these issues, we introduce Ditto, a diffusion-based framework that enables controllable realtime talking head synthesis. Our key innovation lies in bridging motion generation and photorealistic neural rendering through an explicit identity-agnostic motion space, replacing conventional VAE representations. This design substantially reduces the complexity of diffusion learning while enabling precise control over the synthesized talking heads. We further propose an inference strategy that jointly optimizes three key components: audio feature extraction, motion generation, and video synthesis. This optimization enables streaming processing, realtime inference, and low first-frame delay, which are the functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and substantially outperforms existing methods in both motion control and realtime performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cross-view image synthesis involves generating new images of a scene from different viewpoints or perspectives, given one input image from other viewpoints. Despite recent advancements, there are several limitations in existing methods: 1) reliance on additional data such as semantic segmentation maps or preprocessing modules to bridge the domain gap; 2) insufficient focus on view-specific semantics, leading to compromised image quality and realism; and 3) a lack of diverse datasets representing complex urban environments. To tackle these challenges, we propose: 1) a novel retrieval-guided framework that employs a retrieval network as an embedder to address the domain gap; 2) an innovative generator that enhances semantic consistency and diversity specific to the target view to improve image quality and realism; and 3) a new dataset, VIGOR-GEN, providing diverse cross-view image pairs in urban settings to enrich dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on well-known CVUSA, CVACT, and new VIGOR-GEN datasets demonstrate that our method generates images of superior realism, significantly outperforming current leading approaches, particularly in SSIM and FID evaluations.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19512">Topology-Preserving Scaling in Data Augmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vu-Anh Le, Mehmet Dik</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an algorithmic framework for dataset normalization in data augmentation pipelines that preserves topological stability under non-uniform scaling transformations. Given a finite metric space \( X \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) with Euclidean distance \( d_X \), we consider scaling transformations defined by scaling factors \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n > 0 \). Specifically, we define a scaling function \( S \) that maps each point \( x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in X \) to \[ S(x) = (s_1 x_1, s_2 x_2, \ldots, s_n x_n). \] Our main result establishes that the bottleneck distance \( d_B(D, D_S) \) between the persistence diagrams \( D \) of \( X \) and \( D_S \) of \( S(X) \) satisfies: \[ d_B(D, D_S) \leq (s_{\max} - s_{\min}) \cdot \operatorname{diam}(X), \] where \( s_{\min} = \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), \( s_{\max} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), and \( \operatorname{diam}(X) \) is the diameter of \( X \). Based on this theoretical guarantee, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the scaling variability \( \Delta_s = s_{\max} - s_{\min} \) under the constraint \( d_B(D, D_S) \leq \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon > 0 \) is a user-defined tolerance.
  We develop an algorithmic solution to this problem, ensuring that data augmentation via scaling transformations preserves essential topological features. We further extend our analysis to higher-dimensional homological features, alternative metrics such as the Wasserstein distance, and iterative or probabilistic scaling scenarios. Our contributions provide a rigorous mathematical framework for dataset normalization in data augmentation pipelines, ensuring that essential topological characteristics are maintained despite scaling transformations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recommendation systems predominantly utilize two-tower architectures, which evaluate user-item rankings through the inner product of their respective embeddings. However, one key limitation of two-tower models is that they learn a pair-agnostic representation of users and items. In contrast, pair-wise representations either scale poorly due to their quadratic complexity or are too restrictive on the candidate pairs to rank. To address these issues, we introduce Context-based Graph Neural Networks (ContextGNNs), a novel deep learning architecture for link prediction in recommendation systems. The method employs a pair-wise representation technique for familiar items situated within a user's local subgraph, while leveraging two-tower representations to facilitate the recommendation of exploratory items. A final network then predicts how to fuse both pair-wise and two-tower recommendations into a single ranking of items. We demonstrate that ContextGNN is able to adapt to different data characteristics and outperforms existing methods, both traditional and GNN-based, on a diverse set of practical recommendation tasks, improving performance by 20% on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhartha Bhattacharya, Aarham Wasit, Mason Earles, Nitin Nitin, Luyao Ma, Jiyoon Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid detection of foodborne bacteria is critical for food safety and quality, yet traditional culture-based methods require extended incubation and specialized sample preparation. This study addresses these challenges by i) enhancing the generalizability of AI-enabled microscopy for bacterial classification using adversarial domain adaptation and ii) comparing the performance of single-target and multi-domain adaptation. Three Gram-positive (Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua) and three Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium) strains were classified. EfficientNetV2 served as the backbone architecture, leveraging fine-grained feature extraction for small targets. Few-shot learning enabled scalability, with domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) addressing single domains and multi-DANNs (MDANNs) generalizing across all target domains. The model was trained on source domain data collected under controlled conditions (phase contrast microscopy, 60x magnification, 3-h bacterial incubation) and evaluated on target domains with variations in microscopy modality (brightfield, BF), magnification (20x), and extended incubation to compensate for lower resolution (20x-5h). DANNs improved target domain classification accuracy by up to 54.45% (20x), 43.44% (20x-5h), and 31.67% (BF), with minimal source domain degradation (<4.44%). MDANNs achieved superior performance in the BF domain and substantial gains in the 20x domain. Grad-CAM and t-SNE visualizations validated the model's ability to learn domain-invariant features across diverse conditions. This study presents a scalable and adaptable framework for bacterial classification, reducing reliance on extensive sample preparation and enabling application in decentralized and resource-limited environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Density-Calibrated Conformal Quantile Regression (CQR-d) method, a novel approach for constructing prediction intervals that adapts to varying uncertainty across the feature space. Building upon conformal quantile regression, CQR-d incorporates local information through a weighted combination of local and global conformity scores, where the weights are determined by local data density. We prove that CQR-d provides valid marginal coverage at level $1 - \alpha - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents a small tolerance from numerical optimization. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to the a heteroscedastic dataset available in R, we demonstrate that CQR-d maintains the desired coverage while producing substantially narrower prediction intervals compared to standard conformal quantile regression (CQR). Notably, in our application on heteroscedastic data, CQR-d achieves an $8.6\%$ reduction in average interval width while maintaining comparable coverage. The method's effectiveness is particularly pronounced in settings with clear local uncertainty patterns, making it a valuable tool for prediction tasks in heterogeneous data environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress in talking head synthesis since the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), visual artifacts and high training costs persist as major obstacles to large-scale commercial adoption. We propose that identifying and establishing fine-grained and generalizable correspondences between driving signals and generated results can simultaneously resolve both problems. Here we present LokiTalk, a novel framework designed to enhance NeRF-based talking heads with lifelike facial dynamics and improved training efficiency. To achieve fine-grained correspondences, we introduce Region-Specific Deformation Fields, which decompose the overall portrait motion into lip movements, eye blinking, head pose, and torso movements. By hierarchically modeling the driving signals and their associated regions through two cascaded deformation fields, we significantly improve dynamic accuracy and minimize synthetic artifacts. Furthermore, we propose ID-Aware Knowledge Transfer, a plug-and-play module that learns generalizable dynamic and static correspondences from multi-identity videos, while simultaneously extracting ID-specific dynamic and static features to refine the depiction of individual characters. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LokiTalk delivers superior high-fidelity results and training efficiency compared to previous methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human motion, inherently continuous and dynamic, presents significant challenges for generative models. Despite their dominance, discrete quantization methods, such as VQ-VAEs, suffer from inherent limitations, including restricted expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. Continuous approaches, while producing smoother and more natural motions, often falter due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this "discord" between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that decodes discrete motion tokens into continuous motion through rectified flow. By employing an iterative refinement process in the continuous space, DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and ensures smoother and more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DisCoRD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID of 0.032 on HumanML3D and 0.169 on KIT-ML. These results solidify DisCoRD as a robust solution for bridging the divide between discrete efficiency and continuous realism.

<p>Abstract: Standard clothing asset generation involves creating forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized sampling distributions and precise structural requirements in the generated images. Existing models have limited spatial perception and often exhibit structural hallucinations in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating external knowledge from LLM and databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two core processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a three-level alignment that ensures fidelity in structural, pattern, and decoding components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and detail-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Xinlei He, Xinyi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in fine-tuning proprietary language models enable customized applications across various domains but also introduce two major challenges: high resource demands and security risks. Regarding resource demands, recent work proposes novel partial compression, such as BitDelta, to quantize the delta weights between the fine-tuned model and base model. Regarding the security risks, user-defined fine-tuning can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as alignment issues, backdoor attacks, and hallucinations. However, most of the current efforts in security assessment focus on the full-precision or full-compression models, it is not well-discussed how the partial compression methods affect security concerns. To bridge this gap, we evaluate the robustness of delta-weight quantization against these security threats. In this paper, we uncover a "free lunch" phenomenon: partial compression can enhance model security against fine-tuning-based attacks with bearable utility loss. Using Llama-2-7b-chat as a case study, we show that, with under 10% utility degradation, the partial compression mitigates alignment-breaking risks by up to 66.17%, harmful backdoor vulnerabilities by 64.46%, and targeted output manipulation risks by up to 90.53%. We further apply LogitLens to visualize internal state transformations during forward passes, suggesting mechanisms for both security failure and recovery in standard versus compressed fine-tuning. This work offers new insights into selecting effective delta compression methods for secure, resource-efficient multi-tenant services.</p>

<p>Abstract: We tackle the problem of quantifying the number of objects by a generative text-to-image model. Rather than retraining such a model for each new image domain of interest, which leads to high computational costs and limited scalability, we are the first to consider this problem from a domain-agnostic perspective. We propose QUOTA, an optimization framework for text-to-image models that enables effective object quantification across unseen domains without retraining. It leverages a dual-loop meta-learning strategy to optimize a domain-invariant prompt. Further, by integrating prompt learning with learnable counting and domain tokens, our method captures stylistic variations and maintains accuracy, even for object classes not encountered during training. For evaluation, we adopt a new benchmark specifically designed for object quantification in domain generalization, enabling rigorous assessment of object quantification accuracy and adaptability across unseen domains in text-to-image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QUOTA outperforms conventional models in both object quantification accuracy and semantic consistency, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable text-to-image generation for any domain.</p>

In this paper, we survey deepfake generation and detection techniques, including the most recent developments in the field, such as diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields. Our literature review covers all deepfake media types, comprising image, video, audio and multimodal (audio-visual) content. We identify various kinds of deepfakes, according to the procedure used to alter or generate the fake content. We further construct a taxonomy of deepfake generation and detection methods, illustrating the important groups of methods and the domains where these methods are applied. Next, we gather datasets used for deepfake detection and provide updated rankings of the best performing deepfake detectors on the most popular datasets. In addition, we develop a novel multimodal benchmark to evaluate deepfake detectors on out-of-distribution content. The results indicate that state-of-the-art detectors fail to generalize to deepfake content generated by unseen deepfake generators. Finally, we propose future directions to obtain robust and powerful deepfake detectors. Our project page and new benchmark are available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/biodeep.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niki Martinel, Mariano Serrao, Christian Micheloni</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel state-space model (SSM)-based framework for skeleton-based human action recognition, with an anatomically-guided architecture that improves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical diagnostics and general action recognition tasks. Our approach decomposes skeletal motion analysis into spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal streams, using channel partitioning to capture distinct movement characteristics efficiently. By implementing a structured, multi-directional scanning strategy within SSMs, our model captures local joint interactions and global motion patterns across multiple anatomical body parts. This anatomically-aware decomposition enhances the ability to identify subtle motion patterns critical in medical diagnosis, such as gait anomalies associated with neurological conditions. On public action recognition benchmarks, i.e., NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy improvements up to $3.2\%$ with lower computational complexity than previous leading transformer-based models. We also introduce a novel medical dataset for motion-based patient neurological disorder analysis to validate our method's potential in automated disease diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Closed-loop simulation is crucial for end-to-end autonomous driving. Existing sensor simulation methods (e.g., NeRF and 3DGS) reconstruct driving scenes based on conditions that closely mirror training data distributions. However, these methods struggle with rendering novel trajectories, such as lane changes. Recent works have demonstrated that integrating world model knowledge alleviates these issues. Despite their efficiency, these approaches still encounter difficulties in the accurate representation of more complex maneuvers, with multi-lane shifts being a notable example. Therefore, we introduce ReconDreamer, which enhances driving scene reconstruction through incremental integration of world model knowledge. Specifically, DriveRestorer is proposed to mitigate artifacts via online restoration. This is complemented by a progressive data update strategy designed to ensure high-quality rendering for more complex maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, ReconDreamer is the first method to effectively render in large maneuvers. Experimental results demonstrate that ReconDreamer outperforms Street Gaussians in the NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, with relative improvements by 24.87%, 6.72%, and 29.97%. Furthermore, ReconDreamer surpasses DriveDreamer4D with PVG during large maneuver rendering, as verified by a relative improvement of 195.87% in the NTA-IoU metric and a comprehensive user study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Touhidul Islam, Md. Abtahi M. Chowdhury, Sumaiya Salekin, Aye T. Maung, Akil A. Taki, Hafiz Imtiaz</p>
<p>Abstract: In contrast to non-medical image denoising, where enhancing image clarity is the primary goal, medical image denoising warrants preservation of crucial features without introduction of new artifacts. However, many denoising methods that improve the clarity of the image, inadvertently alter critical information of the denoised images, potentially compromising classification performance and diagnostic quality. Additionally, supervised denoising methods are not very practical in medical image domain, since a \emph{ground truth} denoised version of a noisy medical image is often extremely challenging to obtain. In this paper, we tackle both of these problems by introducing a novel neural network based method -- \emph{Contextual Checkerboard Denoising}, that can learn denoising from only a dataset of noisy images, while preserving crucial anatomical details necessary for image classification/analysis. We perform our experimentation on real Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, and empirically demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves image quality, providing clearer and more detailed OCT images, while enhancing diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Zhang, Lu Zhang, Ping Hu, Liqian Ma, Yunzhi Zhuge, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Injecting semantics into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently garnered significant attention. While current approaches typically distill 3D semantic features from 2D foundational models (e.g., CLIP and SAM) to facilitate novel view segmentation and semantic understanding, their heavy reliance on 2D supervision can undermine cross-view semantic consistency and necessitate complex data preparation processes, therefore hindering view-consistent scene understanding. In this work, we present FreeGS, an unsupervised semantic-embedded 3DGS framework that achieves view-consistent 3D scene understanding without the need for 2D labels. Instead of directly learning semantic features, we introduce the IDentity-coupled Semantic Field (IDSF) into 3DGS, which captures both semantic representations and view-consistent instance indices for each Gaussian. We optimize IDSF with a two-step alternating strategy: semantics help to extract coherent instances in 3D space, while the resulting instances regularize the injection of stable semantics from 2D space. Additionally, we adopt a 2D-3D joint contrastive loss to enhance the complementarity between view-consistent 3D geometry and rich semantics during the bootstrapping process, enabling FreeGS to uniformly perform tasks such as novel-view semantic segmentation, object selection, and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on LERF-Mask, 3D-OVS, and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that FreeGS performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while avoiding the complex data preprocessing workload.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Ponkshe, Raghav Singhal, Eduard Gorbunov, Alexey Tumanov, Samuel Horvath, Praneeth Vepakomma</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become a standard approach for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a trainable (r x r) matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of standard LoRA while using 27-90x fewer parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Pham, Alexander Jarema, Donggyu Rim, Zhibin Chen, Mohamed S. H. Khlif, Vaughan G. Macefield, Luke A. Henderson, Amy Brodtmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Enlargement of perivascular spaces (PVS) is common in neurodegenerative disorders including cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. PVS enlargement may indicate impaired clearance pathways and there is a need for reliable PVS detection methods which are currently lacking. Aim: To optimise a widely used deep learning model, the no-new-UNet (nnU-Net), for PVS segmentation. Methods: In 30 healthy participants (mean$\pm$SD age: 50$\pm$18.9 years; 13 females), T1-weighted MRI images were acquired using three different protocols on three MRI scanners (3T Siemens Tim Trio, 3T Philips Achieva, and 7T Siemens Magnetom). PVS were manually segmented across ten axial slices in each participant. Segmentations were completed using a sparse annotation strategy. In total, 11 models were compared using various strategies for image handling, preprocessing and semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation (5FCV). The main performance metric was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results: The voxel-spacing agnostic model (mean$\pm$SD DSC=64.3$\pm$3.3%) outperformed models which resampled images to a common resolution (DSC=40.5-55%). Model performance improved substantially following iterative label cleaning (DSC=85.7$\pm$1.2%). Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels (n=12,740) from 18 additional datasets improved the agreement between raw and predicted PVS cluster counts (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient=0.89, 95%CI=0.82-0.94). We extended the model to enable PVS segmentation in the midbrain (DSC=64.3$\pm$6.5%) and hippocampus (DSC=67.8$\pm$5%). Conclusions: Our deep learning models provide a robust and holistic framework for the automated quantification of PVS in brain MRI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Du, Zhenjiang Hu, Guiyu Zhao, Ying Jin, Hongbin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature upsampling is an essential operation in constructing deep convolutional neural networks. However, existing upsamplers either lack specific feature guidance or necessitate the utilization of high-resolution feature maps, resulting in a loss of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we find that the local self-attention naturally has the feature guidance capability, and its computational paradigm aligns closely with the essence of feature upsampling (\ie feature reassembly of neighboring points). Therefore, we introduce local self-attention into the upsampling task and demonstrate that the majority of existing upsamplers can be regarded as special cases of upsamplers based on local self-attention. Considering the potential semantic gap between upsampled points and their neighboring points, we further introduce the deformation mechanism into the upsampler based on local self-attention, thereby proposing LDA-AQU. As a novel dynamic kernel-based upsampler, LDA-AQU utilizes the feature of queries to guide the model in adaptively adjusting the position and aggregation weight of neighboring points, thereby meeting the upsampling requirements across various complex scenarios. In addition, LDA-AQU is lightweight and can be easily integrated into various model architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of LDA-AQU across four dense prediction tasks: object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and semantic segmentation. LDA-AQU consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art upsamplers, achieving performance enhancements of 1.7 AP, 1.5 AP, 2.0 PQ, and 2.5 mIoU compared to the baseline models in the aforementioned four tasks, respectively.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19593">Self-Supervised Denoiser Framework</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilien Valat, Andreas Hauptmann, Ozan \"Oktem</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing images using Computed Tomography (CT) in an industrial context leads to specific challenges that differ from those encountered in other areas, such as clinical CT. Indeed, non-destructive testing with industrial CT will often involve scanning multiple similar objects while maintaining high throughput, requiring short scanning times, which is not a relevant concern in clinical CT. Under-sampling the tomographic data (sinograms) is a natural way to reduce the scanning time at the cost of image quality since the latter depends on the number of measurements. In such a scenario, post-processing techniques are required to compensate for the image artifacts induced by the sinogram sparsity. We introduce the Self-supervised Denoiser Framework (SDF), a self-supervised training method that leverages pre-training on highly sampled sinogram data to enhance the quality of images reconstructed from undersampled sinogram data. The main contribution of SDF is that it proposes to train an image denoiser in the sinogram space by setting the learning task as the prediction of one sinogram subset from another. As such, it does not require ground-truth image data, leverages the abundant data modality in CT, the sinogram, and can drastically enhance the quality of images reconstructed from a fraction of the measurements. We demonstrate that SDF produces better image quality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, than other analytical and self-supervised frameworks in both 2D fan-beam or 3D cone-beam CT settings. Moreover, we show that the enhancement provided by SDF carries over when fine-tuning the image denoiser on a few examples, making it a suitable pre-training technique in a context where there is little high-quality image data. Our results are established on experimental datasets, making SDF a strong candidate for being the building block of foundational image-enhancement models in CT.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Materials Learning Algorithms (MALA) package, a scalable machine learning framework designed to accelerate density functional theory (DFT) calculations suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. Using local descriptors of the atomic environment, MALA models efficiently predict key electronic observables, including local density of states, electronic density, density of states, and total energy. The package integrates data sampling, model training and scalable inference into a unified library, while ensuring compatibility with standard DFT and molecular dynamics codes. We demonstrate MALA's capabilities with examples including boron clusters, aluminum across its solid-liquid phase boundary, and predicting the electronic structure of a stacking fault in a large beryllium slab. Scaling analyses reveal MALA's computational efficiency and identify bottlenecks for future optimization. With its ability to model electronic structures at scales far beyond standard DFT, MALA is well suited for modeling complex material systems, making it a versatile tool for advanced materials research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Zhou, Shenhao Fang, Shibo He, Wenchao Meng, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation (DD) fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches, requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DD methods, without sacrificing classification accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Wu, Wenhao Lin, Weihao Ye, Yiyi Zhou, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: The excessive use of visual tokens in existing Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibits obvious redundancy and brings in prohibitively expensive computation. To gain insights into this problem, we first conduct extensive empirical studies on the attention behaviors of MLLMs, and summarize three main inference stages in MLLMs: (i) Early fusion between tokens is first accomplished quickly. (ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is anonymously released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.</p>

However, Quantum-Mechanical (QM) datasets, crucial for MLIPs, are fragmented across various repositories, hindering accessibility and model development. We introduce the openQDC package, consolidating 37 QM datasets from over 250 quantum methods and 400 million geometries into a single, accessible resource. These datasets are meticulously preprocessed, and standardized for MLIP training, covering a wide range of chemical elements and interactions relevant in organic chemistry. OpenQDC includes tools for normalization and integration, easily accessible via Python. Experiments with well-known architectures like SchNet, TorchMD-Net, and DimeNet reveal challenges for those architectures and constitute a leaderboard to accelerate benchmarking and guide novel algorithms development. Continuously adding datasets to OpenQDC will democratize QM dataset access, foster more collaboration and innovation, enhance MLIP development, and support their adoption in the MD field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coen Visser, Alexander Heinlein, Bianca Giovanardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are an emerging tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been proposed, which have been reported to scale poorly to higher dimensions. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). Inspired by classic optimization problems, this approach incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the squared residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems; the best performance is observed for the Adam optimizer. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration in existing physics-informed neural network pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models has significantly improved robotic manipulation in terms of language-guided task execution and generalization to unseen scenarios. While existing VLAs adapted from pretrained large Vision-Language-Models (VLM) have demonstrated promising generalizability, their task performance is still unsatisfactory as indicated by the low tasks success rates in different environments. In this paper, we present a new advanced VLA architecture derived from VLM. Unlike previous works that directly repurpose VLM for action prediction by simple action quantization, we propose a omponentized VLA architecture that has a specialized action module conditioned on VLM output. We systematically study the design of the action module and demonstrates the strong performance enhancement with diffusion action transformers for action sequence modeling, as well as their favorable scaling behaviors. We also conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the efficacy of our models with varied designs. The evaluation on 5 robot embodiments in simulation and real work shows that our model not only significantly surpasses existing VLAs in task performance and but also exhibits remarkable adaptation to new robots and generalization to unseen objects and backgrounds. It exceeds the average success rates of OpenVLA which has similar model size (7B) with ours by over 35% in simulated evaluation and 55% in real robot experiments. It also outperforms the large RT-2-X model (55B) by 18% absolute success rates in simulation. Code and models can be found on our project page (https://cogact.github.io/).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyi Mo, Tianyu Zhang, Yalong Bai, Bing Su, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image generation and editing using diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancements. Among these, tuning-free methods have gained attention for their ability to perform edits without extensive model adjustments, offering simplicity and efficiency. However, existing tuning-free approaches often struggle with balancing fidelity and editing precision. Reconstruction errors in DDIM Inversion are partly attributed to the cross-attention mechanism in U-Net, which introduces misalignments during the inversion and reconstruction process. To address this, we analyze reconstruction from a structural perspective and propose a novel approach that replaces traditional cross-attention with uniform attention maps, significantly enhancing image reconstruction fidelity. Our method effectively minimizes distortions caused by varying text conditions during noise prediction. To complement this improvement, we introduce an adaptive mask-guided editing technique that integrates seamlessly with our reconstruction approach, ensuring consistency and accuracy in editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only excels in achieving high-fidelity image reconstruction but also performs robustly in real image composition and editing scenarios. This study underscores the potential of uniform attention maps to enhance the fidelity and versatility of diffusion-based image processing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitri Meunier, Zhu Li, Tim Christensen, Arthur Gretton</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the kernel instrumental variable algorithm of \citet{singh2019kernel}, a nonparametric two-stage least squares (2SLS) procedure which has demonstrated strong empirical performance. We provide a convergence analysis that covers both the identified and unidentified settings: when the structural function cannot be identified, we show that the kernel NPIV estimator converges to the IV solution with minimum norm. Crucially, our convergence is with respect to the strong $L_2$-norm, rather than a pseudo-norm. Additionally, we characterize the smoothness of the target function without relying on the instrument, instead leveraging a new description of the projected subspace size (this being closely related to the link condition in inverse learning literature). With the subspace size description and under standard kernel learning assumptions, we derive, for the first time, the minimax optimal learning rate for kernel NPIV in the strong $L_2$-norm. Our result demonstrates that the strength of the instrument is essential to achieve efficient learning. We also improve the original kernel NPIV algorithm by adopting a general spectral regularization in stage 1 regression. The modified regularization can overcome the saturation effect of Tikhonov regularization.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim-Celine Kahl, Selen Erkan, Jeremias Traub, Carsten T. L\"uth, Klaus Maier-Hein, Lena Maier-Hein, Paul F. Jaeger</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts on unseen data remains a critical concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations, limiting their ability to accurately assess model robustness. To address this gap, our work introduces a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key requirements to overcome the current pitfalls and systematically analyze the robustness of VLMs: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, robustness should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the robustness of various fine-tuning methods across three medical datasets with four different types of distribution shifts. Our study reveals several important findings: 1) Sanity baselines that do not utilize image data can perform surprisingly well; 2) We confirm LoRA as the best-performing PEFT method; 3) No PEFT method consistently outperforms others in terms of robustness to shifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Umer Ramzan, Wahab Khaddim, Muhammad Ehsan Rana, Usman Ali, Manohar Ali, Fiaz ul Hassan, Fatima Mehmood</p>
<p>Abstract: This research paper addresses the significant challenge of accurately estimating poverty levels using deep learning, particularly in developing regions where traditional methods like household surveys are often costly, infrequent, and quickly become outdated. To address these issues, we propose a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, extending the ResNet50 model by incorporating a Gated-Attention Feature-Fusion Module (GAFM). Our architecture is designed to improve the model's ability to capture and combine both global and local features from satellite images, leading to more accurate poverty estimates. The model achieves a 75% R2 score, significantly outperforming existing leading methods in poverty mapping. This improvement is due to the model's capacity to focus on and refine the most relevant features, filtering out unnecessary data, which makes it a powerful tool for remote sensing and poverty estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for vision models investigate the information extracted by their feature encoder. We contribute to this effort and propose Neuro-Activated Vision Explanations (NAVE), which extracts the information captured by the encoder by clustering the feature activations of the frozen network to be explained. The method does not aim to explain the model's prediction but to answer questions such as which parts of the image are processed similarly or which information is kept in deeper layers. Experimentally, we leverage NAVE to show that the training dataset and the level of supervision affect which concepts are captured. In addition, our method reveals the impact of registers on vision transformers (ViT) and the information saturation caused by the watermark Clever Hans effect in the training set.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are a widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the industry. While many tools exist empowering developers to build their own systems, measuring their performance locally, with datasets reflective of the system's use cases, is a technological challenge. Solutions to this problem range from non-specific and cheap (most public datasets) to specific and costly (generating data from local documents). In this paper, we show that using public question and answer (Q&A) datasets to assess retrieval performance can lead to non-optimal systems design, and that common tools for RAG dataset generation can lead to unbalanced data. We propose solutions to these issues based on the characterization of RAG datasets through labels and through label-targeted data generation. Finally, we show that fine-tuned small LLMs can efficiently generate Q&A datasets. We believe that these observations are invaluable to the know-your-data step of RAG systems development.</p>

<p>Abstract: As urban populations grow, cities are becoming more complex, driving the deployment of interconnected sensing systems to realize the vision of smart cities. These systems aim to improve safety, mobility, and quality of life through applications that integrate diverse sensors with real-time decision-making. Streetscape applications-focusing on challenges like pedestrian safety and adaptive traffic management-depend on managing distributed, heterogeneous sensor data, aligning information across time and space, and enabling real-time processing. These tasks are inherently complex and often difficult to scale. The Streetscape Application Services Stack (SASS) addresses these challenges with three core services: multimodal data synchronization, spatiotemporal data fusion, and distributed edge computing. By structuring these capabilities as clear, composable abstractions with clear semantics, SASS allows developers to scale streetscape applications efficiently while minimizing the complexity of multimodal integration.
  We evaluated SASS in two real-world testbed environments: a controlled parking lot and an urban intersection in a major U.S. city. These testbeds allowed us to test SASS under diverse conditions, demonstrating its practical applicability. The Multimodal Data Synchronization service reduced temporal misalignment errors by 88%, achieving synchronization accuracy within 50 milliseconds. Spatiotemporal Data Fusion service improved detection accuracy for pedestrians and vehicles by over 10%, leveraging multicamera integration. The Distributed Edge Computing service increased system throughput by more than an order of magnitude. Together, these results show how SASS provides the abstractions and performance needed to support real-time, scalable urban applications, bridging the gap between sensing infrastructure and actionable streetscape intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Cui, Yuezun Li, Ao Luo, Jiaran Zhou, Junyu Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe the Forensics Adapter, an adapter network designed to transform CLIP into an effective and generalizable face forgery detector. Although CLIP is highly versatile, adapting it for face forgery detection is non-trivial as forgery-related knowledge is entangled with a wide range of unrelated knowledge. Existing methods treat CLIP merely as a feature extractor, lacking task-specific adaptation, which limits their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce an adapter to learn face forgery traces -- the blending boundaries unique to forged faces, guided by task-specific objectives. Then we enhance the CLIP visual tokens with a dedicated interaction strategy that communicates knowledge across CLIP and the adapter. Since the adapter is alongside CLIP, its versatility is highly retained, naturally ensuring strong generalizability in face forgery detection. With only $\bm{5.7M}$ trainable parameters, our method achieves a significant performance boost, improving by approximately $\bm{7\%}$ on average across five standard datasets. We believe the proposed method can serve as a baseline for future CLIP-based face forgery detection methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gasser Elazab, Torben Gr\"aber, Michael Unterreiner, Olaf Hellwich</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) has gained popularity for obtaining depth predictions directly from videos. However, these methods often produce scale invariant results, unless additional training signals are provided. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised metric-scaled MDE model that requires only monocular video data and the camera's mounting position, both of which are readily available in modern vehicles. Our approach leverages planar-parallax geometry to reconstruct scene structure. The full pipeline consists of three main networks, a multi-frame network, a singleframe network, and a pose network. The multi-frame network processes sequential frames to estimate the structure of the static scene using planar-parallax geometry and the camera mounting position. Based on this reconstruction, it acts as a teacher, distilling knowledge such as scale information, masked drivable area, metric-scale depth for the static scene, and dynamic object mask to the singleframe network. It also aids the pose network in predicting a metric-scaled relative pose between two subsequent images. Our method achieved state-of-the-art results for the driving benchmark KITTI for metric-scaled depth prediction. Notably, it is one of the first methods to produce self-supervised metric-scaled depth prediction for the challenging Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Mohammed Mostaque Billah, Ateya Ahmed Subarna, Sudipta Nandi Sarna, Ahmad Shawkat Wasit, Anika Fariha, Asif Sushmit, Arig Yousuf Sadeque</p>
<p>Abstract: Around seven million individuals in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal speak Santali, positioning it as nearly the third most commonly used Austroasiatic language. Despite its prominence among the Austroasiatic language family's Munda subfamily, Santali lacks global recognition. Currently, no translation models exist for the Santali language. Our paper aims to include Santali to the NPL spectrum. We aim to examine the feasibility of building Santali translation models based on available Santali corpora. The paper successfully addressed the low-resource problem and, with promising results, examined the possibility of creating a functional Santali machine translation model in a low-resource setup. Our study shows that Santali-English parallel corpus performs better when in transformers like mt5 as opposed to untrained transformers, proving that transfer learning can be a viable technique that works with Santali language. Besides the mT5 transformer, Santali-English performs better than Santali-Bangla parallel corpus as the mT5 has been trained in way more English data than Bangla data. Lastly, our study shows that with data augmentation, our model performs better.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19731">Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Video Streams</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabien Poirier</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis is part of a CIFRE agreement between the company Othello and the LIASD laboratory. The objective is to develop an artificial intelligence system that can detect real-time dangers in a video stream. To achieve this, a novel approach combining temporal and spatial analysis has been proposed. Several avenues have been explored to improve anomaly detection by integrating object detection, human pose detection, and motion analysis. For result interpretability, techniques commonly used for image analysis, such as activation and saliency maps, have been extended to videos, and an original method has been proposed. The proposed architecture performs binary or multiclass classification depending on whether an alert or the cause needs to be identified. Numerous neural networkmodels have been tested, and three of them have been selected. You Only Looks Once (YOLO) has been used for spatial analysis, a Convolutional Recurrent Neuronal Network (CRNN) composed of VGG19 and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for temporal analysis, and a multi-layer perceptron for classification. These models handle different types of data and can be combined in parallel or in series. Although the parallel mode is faster, the serial mode is generally more reliable. For training these models, supervised learning was chosen, and two proprietary datasets were created. The first dataset focuses on objects that may play a potential role in anomalies, while the second consists of videos containing anomalies or non-anomalies. This approach allows for the processing of both continuous video streams and finite videos, providing greater flexibility in detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Severin Bochem, Eduardo Gonzalez-Sanchez, Yves Bicker, Gabriele Fadini</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning often requires extensive training data. Simulation-to-real transfer offers a promising approach to address this challenge in robotics. While differentiable simulators offer improved sample efficiency through exact gradients, they can be unstable in contact-rich environments and may lead to poor generalization. This paper introduces a novel approach integrating sharpness-aware optimization into gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithms. Our simulation results demonstrate that our method, tested on contact-rich environments, significantly enhances policy robustness to environmental variations and action perturbations while maintaining the sample efficiency of first-order methods. Specifically, our approach improves action noise tolerance compared to standard first-order methods and achieves generalization comparable to zeroth-order methods. This improvement stems from finding flatter minima in the loss landscape, associated with better generalization. Our work offers a promising solution to balance efficient learning and robust sim-to-real transfer in robotics, potentially bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Rahimi, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Wang, Marcus Klasson, Matias Turkulainen, Shuzhe Wang, Juho Kannala, Arno Solin</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian splatting enables fast novel view synthesis in static 3D environments. However, reconstructing real-world environments remains challenging as distractors or occluders break the multi-view consistency assumption required for accurate 3D reconstruction. Most existing methods rely on external semantic information from pre-trained models, introducing additional computational overhead as pre-processing steps or during optimization. In this work, we propose a novel method, DeSplat, that directly separates distractors and static scene elements purely based on volume rendering of Gaussian primitives. We initialize Gaussians within each camera view for reconstructing the view-specific distractors to separately model the static 3D scene and distractors in the alpha compositing stages. DeSplat yields an explicit scene separation of static elements and distractors, achieving comparable results to prior distractor-free approaches without sacrificing rendering speed. We demonstrate DeSplat's effectiveness on three benchmark data sets for distractor-free novel view synthesis. See the project website at https://aaltoml.github.io/desplat/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Change detection, which typically relies on the comparison of bi-temporal images, is significantly hindered when only a single image is available. Comparing a single image with an existing map, such as OpenStreetMap, which is continuously updated through crowd-sourcing, offers a viable solution to this challenge. Unlike images that carry low-level visual details of ground objects, maps convey high-level categorical information. This discrepancy in abstraction levels complicates the alignment and comparison of the two data types. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{La}nguage-\textbf{VI}sion \textbf{D}iscriminator for d\textbf{E}tecting changes in satellite image with map references, namely \ours{}, which leverages language to bridge the information gap between maps and images. Specifically, \ours{} formulates change detection as the problem of ``{\textit Does the pixel belong to [class]?}'', aligning maps and images within the feature space of the language-vision model to associate high-level map categories with low-level image details. Moreover, we build a mixture-of-experts discriminative module, which compares linguistic features from maps with visual features from images across various semantic perspectives, achieving comprehensive semantic comparison for change detection. Extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that \ours{} can effectively detect changes in satellite image with map references, outperforming state-of-the-art change detection algorithms, e.g., with gains of about $13.8$\% on the DynamicEarthNet dataset and $4.3$\% on the SECOND dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the 3D physical world is an emerging yet challenging research direction. Current strategies for processing point clouds typically downsample the scene or divide it into smaller parts for separate analysis. However, both approaches risk losing key local details or global contextual information. In this paper, we introduce PerLA, a 3D language assistant designed to be more perceptive to both details and context, making visual representations more informative for the LLM. PerLA captures high-resolution (local) details in parallel from different point cloud areas and integrates them with (global) context obtained from a lower-resolution whole point cloud. We present a novel algorithm that preserves point cloud locality through the Hilbert curve and effectively aggregates local-to-global information via cross-attention and a graph neural network. Lastly, we introduce a novel loss for local representation consensus to promote training stability. PerLA outperforms state-of-the-art 3D language assistants, with gains of up to +1.34 CiDEr on ScanQA for question answering, and +4.22 on ScanRefer and +3.88 on Nr3D for dense captioning.\url{https://gfmei.github.io/PerLA/}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexa Tyberg, Yunhao Fan, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework for large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of itinerant electron Ising systems. As the effective interactions between Ising spins in such itinerant magnets are mediated by conducting electrons, the calculation of energy change due to a local spin update requires solving an electronic structure problem. Such repeated electronic structure calculations could be overwhelmingly prohibitive for large systems. Assuming the locality principle, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed to directly predict the effective local field and the corresponding energy change associated with a given spin update based on Ising configuration in a finite neighborhood. As the kernel size of the CNN is fixed at a constant, the model can be directly scalable to kMC simulations of large lattices. Our approach is reminiscent of the ML force-field models widely used in first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Applying our ML framework to a square-lattice double-exchange Ising model, we uncover unusual coarsening of ferromagnetic domains at low temperatures. Our work highlights the potential of ML methods for large-scale modeling of similar itinerant systems with discrete dynamical variables.</p>

MoTe enables us to handle the paired text-motion generation, motion captioning, and text-driven motion generation by simply modifying the input context. Specifically, MoTe is composed of three components: Motion Encoder-Decoder (MED), Text Encoder-Decoder (TED), and Moti-on-Text Diffusion Model (MTDM). In particular, MED and TED are trained for extracting latent embeddings, and subsequently reconstructing the motion sequences and textual descriptions from the extracted embeddings, respectively. MTDM, on the other hand, performs an iterative denoising process on the input context to handle diverse tasks. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method on text-to-motion generation and competitive performance on motion captioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S\"onke Tenckhoff, Mario Koddenbrock, Erik Rodner</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated object detection has become increasingly valuable across diverse applications, yet efficient, high-quality annotation remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a platform designed to interactively improve object detection models. The platform allows uploading and annotating images as well as fine-tuning object detection models. Users can then manually review and refine annotations, further creating improved snapshots that are used for automatic object detection on subsequent image uploads - a process we refer to as semi-automatic annotation resulting in a significant gain in annotation efficiency.
  Whereas iterative refinement of model results to speed up annotation has become common practice, we are the first to quantitatively evaluate its benefits with respect to time, effort, and interaction savings. Our experimental results show clear evidence for a significant time reduction of up to 53% for semi-automatic compared to manual annotation. Importantly, these efficiency gains did not compromise annotation quality, while matching or occasionally even exceeding the accuracy of manual annotations. These findings demonstrate the potential of our lightweight annotation platform for creating high-quality object detection datasets and provide best practices to guide future development of annotation platforms.
  The platform is open-source, with the frontend and backend repositories available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian D Parker, Anton Smirnov, Jordi Pons, CJ Carr, Zack Zukowski, Zach Evans, Xubo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The tokenization of speech with neural audio codec models is a vital part of modern AI pipelines for the generation or understanding of speech, alone or in a multimodal context. Traditionally such tokenization models have concentrated on low parameter-count architectures using only components with strong inductive biases. In this work we show that by scaling a transformer architecture with large parameter count to this problem, and applying a flexible Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) based bottleneck, it is possible to reach state-of-the-art speech quality at extremely low bit-rates of $400$ or $700$ bits-per-second. The trained models strongly out-perform existing baselines in both objective and subjective tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liqiang Zhang Ye Tian Dongyan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Wolters, Johannes Gilg, Torben Teepe, Fabian Herzog, Felix Fent, Gerhard Rigoll</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present SpaRC, a novel Sparse fusion transformer for 3D perception that integrates multi-view image semantics with Radar and Camera point features. The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/phi-wol/sparc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Zifeng Wang, Hamid Palangi, Rujun Han, Sayna Ebrahimi, Long Le, Vincent Perot, Swaroop Mishra, Mohit Bansal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning. Humans can reason not only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the solution and reason towards the problem. This often enhances overall reasoning performance as it enables consistency checks between their forward and backward thinking. To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking, we introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data augmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by collecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model, consisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward question, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train a smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward reasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question, and (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments across 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an average 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a 6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines. Moreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the correct forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard fine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Almeida, Pedro Rodrigues, Diogo Magalh\~aes, Armando J. Pinho, Diogo Pratas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces AIDetx, a novel method for detecting machine-generated text using data compression techniques. Traditional approaches, such as deep learning classifiers, often suffer from high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a compression-based classification framework that leverages finite-context models (FCMs). AIDetx constructs distinct compression models for human-written and AI-generated text, classifying new inputs based on which model achieves a higher compression ratio. We evaluated AIDetx on two benchmark datasets, achieving F1 scores exceeding 97% and 99%, respectively, highlighting its high accuracy. Compared to current methods, such as large language models (LLMs), AIDetx offers a more interpretable and computationally efficient solution, significantly reducing both training time and hardware requirements (e.g., no GPUs needed).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulrahman Al-Fakih, A. Koeshidayatullah, Tapan Mukerji, SanLinn I. Kaka</p>
<p>Abstract: Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown significant success in modeling data distributions for image datasets, their application to structured or tabular data, such as well logs, remains relatively underexplored. This study extends the ensemble GANs (EGANs) framework to capture the distribution of well log data and detect anomalies that fall outside of these distributions. The proposed approach compares the performance of traditional methods, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), with EGANs in detecting anomalies outside the expected data distributions. For the gamma ray (GR) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.62 and F1 score of 0.76, outperforming GMM's precision of 0.38 and F1 score of 0.54. Similarly, for travel time (DT), EGANs achieved a precision of 0.70 and F1 score of 0.79, surpassing GMM 0.56 and 0.71. In the neutron porosity (NPHI) dataset, EGANs recorded a precision of 0.53 and F1 score of 0.68, outshining GMM 0.47 and 0.61. For the bulk density (RHOB) dataset, EGANs achieved a precision of 0.52 and an F1 score of 0.67, slightly outperforming GMM, which yielded a precision of 0.50 and an F1 score of 0.65. This work's novelty lies in applying EGANs for well log data analysis, showcasing their ability to learn data patterns and identify anomalies that deviate from them. This approach offers more reliable anomaly detection compared to traditional methods like GMM. The findings highlight the potential of EGANs in enhancing anomaly detection for well log data, delivering significant implications for optimizing drilling strategies and reservoir management through more accurate, data-driven insights into subsurface characterization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Won Lee, Selina Leveugle, Svetlana Stolpner, Chris Langley, Paul Grouchy, Jonathan Kelly, Steven L. Waslander</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly segmentation is a valuable computer vision task for safety-critical applications that need to be aware of unexpected events. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) scene-level anomaly segmentation approaches rely on diverse inlier class labels during training, limiting their ability to leverage vast unlabeled datasets and pre-trained vision encoders. These methods may underperform in domains with reduced color diversity and limited object classes. Conversely, existing unsupervised methods struggle with anomaly segmentation with the diverse scenes of less restricted domains. To address these challenges, we introduce FlowCLAS, a novel self-supervised framework that utilizes vision foundation models to extract rich features and employs a normalizing flow network to learn their density distribution. We enhance the model's discriminative power by incorporating Outlier Exposure and contrastive learning in the latent space. FlowCLAS significantly outperforms all existing methods on the ALLO anomaly segmentation benchmark for space robotics and demonstrates competitive results on multiple road anomaly segmentation benchmarks for autonomous driving, including Fishyscapes Lost&Found and Road Anomaly. These results highlight FlowCLAS's effectiveness in addressing the unique challenges of space anomaly segmentation while retaining SOTA performance in the autonomous driving domain without reliance on inlier segmentation labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the capabilities of classical simulation methods is key to identifying where quantum computers are advantageous. Not only does this ensure that quantum computers are used only where necessary, but also one can potentially identify subroutines that can be offloaded onto a classical device. In this work, we show that it is always possible to generate a classical surrogate of a sub-region (dubbed a "patch") of an expectation landscape produced by a parameterized quantum circuit. That is, we provide a quantum-enhanced classical algorithm which, after simple measurements on a quantum device, allows one to classically simulate approximate expectation values of a subregion of a landscape. We provide time and sample complexity guarantees for a range of families of circuits of interest, and further numerically demonstrate our simulation algorithms on an exactly verifiable simulation of a Hamiltonian variational ansatz and long-time dynamics simulation on a 127-qubit heavy-hex topology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Araceli Guzm\'an-Trist\'an, Antonio Rieser</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a pair of completely data-driven algorithms for unsupervised classification and dimension reduction, and we empirically study their performance on a number of data sets, both simulated data in three-dimensions and images from the COIL-20 data set. The algorithms take as input a set of points sampled from a uniform distribution supported on a metric space, the latter embedded in an ambient metric space, and they output a clustering or reduction of dimension of the data. They work by constructing a natural family of graphs from the data and selecting the graph which maximizes the relative von Neumann entropy of certain normalized heat operators constructed from the graphs. Once the appropriate graph is selected, the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian may be used to reduce the dimension of the data, and clusters in the data may be identified with the kernel of the associated graph Laplacian. Notably, these algorithms do not require information about the size of a neighborhood or the desired number of clusters as input, in contrast to popular algorithms such as $k$-means, and even more modern spectral methods such as Laplacian eigenmaps, among others.
  In our computational experiments, our clustering algorithm outperforms $k$-means clustering on data sets with non-trivial geometry and topology, in particular data whose clusters are not concentrated around a specific point, and our dimension reduction algorithm is shown to work well in several simple examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prajwal Singh, Ashish Tiwari, Gautam Vashishtha, Shanmuganathan Raman</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have exhibited highly photorealistic rendering of novel views through per-scene optimization over a single 3D scene. With the growing popularity of NeRF and its variants, they have become ubiquitous and have been identified as efficient 3D resources. However, they are still far from being scalable since a separate model needs to be stored for each scene, and the training time increases linearly with every newly added scene. Surprisingly, the idea of encoding multiple 3D scenes into a single NeRF model is heavily under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel conditional-cum-continual framework, called $C^{3}$-NeRF, to accommodate multiple scenes into the parameters of a single neural radiance field. Unlike conventional approaches that leverage feature extractors and pre-trained priors for scene conditioning, we use simple pseudo-scene labels to model multiple scenes in NeRF. Interestingly, we observe the framework is also inherently continual (via generative replay) with minimal, if not no, forgetting of the previously learned scenes. Consequently, the proposed framework adapts to multiple new scenes without necessarily accessing the old data. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the inherent capacity of the NeRF model to accommodate multiple scenes with high-quality novel-view renderings without adding additional parameters. We provide implementation details and dynamic visualizations of our results in the supplementary file.</p>

Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a hugely time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-system) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Gronsbell, Jianhui Gao, Yaqi Shi, Zachary R. McCaw, David Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Prediction-based (PB) inference is increasingly used in applications where the outcome of interest is difficult to obtain, but its predictors are readily available. Unlike traditional inference, PB inference performs statistical inference using a partially observed outcome and a set of covariates by leveraging a prediction of the outcome generated from a machine learning (ML) model. Motwani and Witten (2023) recently revisited two innovative PB inference approaches for ordinary least squares. They found that the method proposed by Wang et al. (2020) yields a consistent estimator for the association of interest when the ML model perfectly captures the underlying regression function. Conversely, the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method proposed by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) yields valid inference regardless of the model's accuracy. In this paper, we study the statistical efficiency of the PPI estimator. Our analysis reveals that a more efficient estimator, proposed 25 years ago by Chen and Chen (2000), can be obtained by simply adding a weight to the PPI estimator. We also contextualize PB inference with methods from the economics and statistics literature dating back to the 1960s. Our extensive theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the Chen and Chen (CC) estimator offers a balance between robustness to ML model specification and statistical efficiency, making it the preferred choice for use in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantifying the gap between synthetic and real-world imagery is essential for improving both transformer-based models - that rely on large volumes of data - and datasets, especially in underexplored domains like aerial scene understanding where the potential impact is significant. This paper introduces a novel methodology for scene complexity assessment using Multi-Model Consensus Metric (MMCM) and depth-based structural metrics, enabling a robust evaluation of perceptual and structural disparities between domains. Our experimental analysis, utilizing real-world (Dronescapes) and synthetic (Skyscenes) datasets, demonstrates that real-world scenes generally exhibit higher consensus among state-of-the-art vision transformers, while synthetic scenes show greater variability and challenge model adaptability. The results underline the inherent complexities and domain gaps, emphasizing the need for enhanced simulation fidelity and model generalization. This work provides critical insights into the interplay between domain characteristics and model performance, offering a pathway for improved domain adaptation strategies in aerial scene understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of general multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, adapting general MLLMs to specific domains, such as scientific fields and industrial applications, remains less explored. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using open-source models, we develop a visual instruction synthesizer that effectively generates diverse visual instruction tasks from domain-specific image-caption pairs. Our synthetic tasks surpass those generated by manual rules, GPT-4, and GPT-4V in enhancing the domain-specific performance of MLLMs. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct experiments in two domains, biomedicine and food, by post-training MLLMs of different sources and scales (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, LLaVA-v1.6-8B, Llama-3.2-11B), and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. To support further research in MLLM domain adaptation, we will open-source our implementations.</p>

This year, the challenge had seven tracks (up from six last year) and covered low-level and high-level tasks, with language and non-language interfaces, across video, audio, and text modalities; the additional track covered hour-long video understanding and introduced a novel video QA benchmark 1h-walk VQA. Overall, the tasks in the different tracks were: object tracking, point tracking, temporal action localisation, temporal sound localisation, multiple-choice video question-answering, grounded video question-answering, and hour-long video question-answering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ye, Xiaoxuan Ma, Hai Ci, Wentao Zhu, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving realistic animated human avatars requires accurate modeling of pose-dependent clothing deformations. Existing learning-based methods heavily rely on the Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) of minimally-clothed human models like SMPL to model deformation. However, these methods struggle to handle loose clothing, such as long dresses, where the canonicalization process becomes ill-defined when the clothing is far from the body, leading to disjointed and fragmented results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid framework to model challenging clothed humans. Our core idea is to use dedicated strategies to model different regions, depending on whether they are close to or distant from the body. Specifically, we segment the human body into three categories: unclothed, deformed, and generated. We simply replicate unclothed regions that require no deformation. For deformed regions close to the body, we leverage LBS to handle the deformation. As for the generated regions, which correspond to loose clothing areas, we introduce a novel free-form, part-aware generator to model them, as they are less affected by movements. This free-form generation paradigm brings enhanced flexibility and expressiveness to our hybrid framework, enabling it to capture the intricate geometric details of challenging loose clothing, such as skirts and dresses. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset featuring loose clothing demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior visual fidelity and realism, particularly in the most challenging cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Shen, Ammar Sherif, Zeyuan Yin, Shitong Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in dataset distillation have led to solutions in two main directions. The conventional batch-to-batch matching mechanism is ideal for small-scale datasets and includes bi-level optimization methods on models and syntheses, such as FRePo, RCIG, and RaT-BPTT, as well as other methods like distribution matching, gradient matching, and weight trajectory matching. Conversely, batch-to-global matching typifies decoupled methods, which are particularly advantageous for large-scale datasets. This approach has garnered substantial interest within the community, as seen in SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, WMDD, and CDA. A primary challenge with the second approach is the lack of diversity among syntheses within each class since samples are optimized independently and the same global supervision signals are reused across different synthetic images. In this study, we propose a new Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training (DELT) scheme to enhance the diversity of images in batch-to-global matching with less computation. Our approach is conceptually simple yet effective, it partitions predefined IPC samples into smaller subtasks and employs local optimizations to distill each subset into distributions from distinct phases, reducing the uniformity induced by the unified optimization process. These distilled images from the subtasks demonstrate effective generalization when applied to the entire task. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and its sub-datasets. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 2$\sim$5% on average across different datasets and IPCs (images per class), increasing diversity per class by more than 5% while reducing synthesis time by up to 39.3% for enhancing the training efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuze He, Wang Zhao, Shaohui Liu, Yubin Hu, Yushi Bai, Yu-Hui Wen, Yong-Jin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce AlphaTablets, a novel and generic representation of 3D planes that features continuous 3D surface and precise boundary delineation. By representing 3D planes as rectangles with alpha channels, AlphaTablets combine the advantages of current 2D and 3D plane representations, enabling accurate, consistent and flexible modeling of 3D planes. We derive differentiable rasterization on top of AlphaTablets to efficiently render 3D planes into images, and propose a novel bottom-up pipeline for 3D planar reconstruction from monocular videos. Starting with 2D superpixels and geometric cues from pre-trained models, we initialize 3D planes as AlphaTablets and optimize them via differentiable rendering. An effective merging scheme is introduced to facilitate the growth and refinement of AlphaTablets. Through iterative optimization and merging, we reconstruct complete and accurate 3D planes with solid surfaces and clear boundaries. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction, underscoring the great potential of AlphaTablets as a generic 3D plane representation for various applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Yunhang Shen, Chunjiang Ge, Yan Yang, Zuwei Long, Yuhan Dai, Tong Xu, Xing Sun, Ran He, Caifeng Shan, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data. The code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhe Bekkemoen, Helge Langseth</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are powerful function approximators with tremendous potential in learning complex distributions. However, they are prone to overfitting on spurious patterns. Bayesian inference provides a principled way to regularize neural networks and give well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. It allows us to specify prior knowledge on weights. However, specifying domain knowledge via distributions over weights is infeasible. Furthermore, it is unable to correct models when they focus on spurious or irrelevant features. New methods within explainable artificial intelligence allow us to regularize explanations in the form of feature importance to add domain knowledge and correct the models' focus. Nevertheless, they are incompatible with Bayesian neural networks, as they require us to modify the loss function. We propose a new explanation regularization method that is compatible with Bayesian inference. Consequently, we can quantify uncertainty and, at the same time, have correct explanations. We test our method using four different datasets. The results show that our method improves predictive performance when models overfit on spurious features or are uncertain of which features to focus on. Moreover, our method performs better than augmenting training data with samples where spurious features are removed through masking. We provide code, data, trained weights, and hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saber Malekmohammadi, Kiarash Shaloudegi, Zeou Hu, Yaoliang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, the federated learning ($\texttt{FL}$) community has witnessed a proliferation of new $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. However, our understating of the theory of $\texttt{FL}$ is still fragmented, and a thorough, formal comparison of these algorithms remains elusive. Motivated by this gap, we show that many of the existing $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms can be understood from an operator splitting point of view. This unification allows us to compare different algorithms with ease, to refine previous convergence results and to uncover new algorithmic variants. In particular, our analysis reveals the vital role played by the step size in $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. The unification also leads to a streamlined and economic way to accelerate $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms, without incurring any communication overhead. We perform numerical experiments on both convex and nonconvex models to validate our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Federica Gerace, Negar Rostamzadeh, Luca Saglietti</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) may be oblivious to human bias but it is not immune to its perpetuation. Marginalisation and iniquitous group representation are often traceable in the very data used for training, and may be reflected or even enhanced by the learning models. In the present work, we aim at clarifying the role played by data geometry in the emergence of ML bias. We introduce an exactly solvable high-dimensional model of data imbalance, where parametric control over the many bias-inducing factors allows for an extensive exploration of the bias inheritance mechanism. Through the tools of statistical physics, we analytically characterise the typical properties of learning models trained in this synthetic framework and obtain exact predictions for the observables that are commonly employed for fairness assessment. Despite the simplicity of the data model, we retrace and unpack typical unfairness behaviour observed on real-world datasets. We also obtain a detailed analytical characterisation of a class of bias mitigation strategies. We first consider a basic loss-reweighing scheme, which allows for an implicit minimisation of different unfairness metrics, and quantify the incompatibilities between some existing fairness criteria. Then, we consider a novel mitigation strategy based on a matched inference approach, consisting in the introduction of coupled learning models. Our theoretical analysis of this approach shows that the coupled strategy can strike superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Xie, Pan Zhou, Huan Li, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, different kinds of deep networks typically need different optimizers, which have to be chosen after multiple trials, making the training process inefficient. To relieve this issue and consistently improve the model training speed across deep networks, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum algorithm, Adan for short. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov acceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which avoids the extra overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point. Then, Adan adopts NME to estimate the gradient's first- and second-order moments in adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove that Adan finds an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the non-convex stochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known lower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan consistently surpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on vision, language, and RL tasks and sets new SoTAs for many popular networks and frameworks, e.g., ResNet, ConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, DETR, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, and BERT. More surprisingly, Adan can use half of the training cost (epochs) of SoTA optimizers to achieve higher or comparable performance on ViT, GPT-2, MAE, etc., and also shows great tolerance to a large range of minibatch size, e.g., from 1k to 32k. Code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/Adan, and has been used in multiple popular deep learning frameworks or projects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Fu, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Siddharth Garg, Farshad Khorrami</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes an easy-to-compute upper bound for the overlap index between two probability distributions without requiring any knowledge of the distribution models. The computation of our bound is time-efficient and memory-efficient and only requires finite samples. The proposed bound shows its value in one-class classification and domain shift analysis. Specifically, in one-class classification, we build a novel one-class classifier by converting the bound into a confidence score function. Unlike most one-class classifiers, the training process is not needed for our classifier. Additionally, the experimental results show that our classifier can be accurate with only a small number of in-class samples and outperform many state-of-the-art methods on various datasets in different one-class classification scenarios. In domain shift analysis, we propose a theorem based on our bound. The theorem is useful in detecting the existence of domain shift and inferring data information. The detection and inference processes are both computation-efficient and memory-efficient. Our work shows significant promise toward broadening the applications of overlap-based metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rebecca Salles, Janio Lima, Michel Reis, Rafaelli Coutinho, Esther Pacitti, Florent Masseglia, Reza Akbarinia, Chao Chen, Jonathan Garibaldi, Fabio Porto, Eduardo Ogasawara</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series event detection methods are evaluated mainly by standard classification metrics that focus solely on detection accuracy. However, inaccuracy in detecting an event can often result from its preceding or delayed effects reflected in neighboring detections. These detections are valuable to trigger necessary actions or help mitigate unwelcome consequences. In this context, current metrics are insufficient and inadequate for the context of event detection. There is a demand for metrics that incorporate both the concept of time and temporal tolerance for neighboring detections. This paper introduces SoftED metrics, a new set of metrics designed for soft evaluating event detection methods. They enable the evaluation of both detection accuracy and the degree to which their detections represent events. They improved event detection evaluation by associating events and their representative detections, incorporating temporal tolerance in over 36\% of experiments compared to the usual classification metrics. SoftED metrics were validated by domain specialists that indicated their contribution to detection evaluation and method selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Tavasoli, Behnaz Moradijamei, Heman Shakeri</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an interpretable machine learning approach that characterizes load dynamics within an operator-theoretic framework for electricity load forecasting in power grids. We represent the dynamics of load data using the Koopman operator, which provides a linear, infinite-dimensional representation of the nonlinear dynamics, and approximate a finite version that remains robust against spectral pollutions due to truncation. By computing $\epsilon$-approximate Koopman eigenfunctions using dynamics-adapted kernels in delay coordinates, we decompose the load dynamics into coherent spatiotemporal patterns that evolve quasi-independently. Our approach captures temporal coherent patterns due to seasonal changes and finer time scales, such as time of day and day of the week. This method allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions within power grids and their response to various exogenous factors. We assess our method using a large-scale dataset from a renewable power system in the continental European electricity system. The results indicate that our Koopman-based method surpasses a separately optimized deep learning (LSTM) architecture in both accuracy and computational efficiency, while providing deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of the power grid\footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/Shakeri-Lab/Power-Grids}{github.com/Shakeri-Lab/Power-Grids}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biagio Montaruli, Giuseppe Floris, Christian Scano, Luca Demetrio, Andrea Valenza, Luca Compagna, Davide Ariu, Luca Piras, Davide Balzarotti, Battista Biggio</p>
<p>Abstract: Many Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) leverage the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) to block incoming malicious requests. The CRS consists of different sets of rules designed by domain experts to detect well-known web attack patterns. Both the set of rules to be used and the weights used to combine them are manually defined, yielding four different default configurations of the CRS. In this work, we focus on the detection of SQL injection (SQLi) attacks, and show that the manual configurations of the CRS typically yield a suboptimal trade-off between detection and false alarm rates. Furthermore, we show that these configurations are not robust to adversarial SQLi attacks, i.e., carefully-crafted attacks that iteratively refine the malicious SQLi payload by querying the target WAF to bypass detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose (i) using machine learning to automate the selection of the set of rules to be combined along with their weights, i.e., customizing the CRS configuration based on the monitored web services; and (ii) leveraging adversarial training to significantly improve its robustness to adversarial SQLi manipulations. Our experiments, conducted using the well-known open-source ModSecurity WAF equipped with the CRS rules, show that our approach, named ModSec-AdvLearn, can (i) increase the detection rate up to 30%, while retaining negligible false alarm rates and discarding up to 50% of the CRS rules; and (ii) improve robustness against adversarial SQLi attacks up to 85%, marking a significant stride toward designing more effective and robust WAFs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Son Nguyen, Adam Wang, Albert Montillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional deep learning (DL) models have two ubiquitous limitations. First, they assume training samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), an assumption often violated in real-world datasets where samples are grouped by shared measurements (e.g., participants or cells). This leads to performance degradation, limited generalization, and covariate confounding, which induces Type 1 and Type 2 errors. Second, DL models typically prioritize overall accuracy, favoring accuracy on the majority, while sacrificing performance for underrepresented subpopulations, leading to unfair, biased models. This is critical to remediate, particularly in models influencing decisions regarding loan approvals and healthcare. To address these issues, we propose the Fair Mixed Effects Deep Learning (Fair MEDL) framework. This framework quantifies cluster-invariant fixed effects (FE) and cluster-specific random effects (RE) through: 1) a cluster adversary for learning invariant FE, 2) a Bayesian neural network for RE, and 3) a mixing function combining FE and RE for final predictions. Fairness is enhanced through the architectural and loss function changes introduced by an adversarial debiasing network. We formally define and demonstrate improved fairness across three metrics on both classification and regression tasks: equalized odds, demographic parity, and counterfactual fairness. Our method also identifies and de-weights confounded covariates, mitigating Type 1 and 2 errors. The framework is comprehensively evaluated across three datasets spanning two industries, including finance and healthcare. The Fair MEDL framework improves fairness by 86.4% for Age, 64.9% for Race, 57.8% for Sex, and 36.2% for Marital status, while maintaining robust predictive performance. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geri Skenderi, Luigi Capogrosso, Andrea Toaiari, Matteo Denitto, Franco Fummi, Simone Melzi, Marco Cristani</p>
<p>Abstract: Auxiliary tasks facilitate learning in situations when data is scarce or the principal task of focus is extremely complex. This idea is primarily inspired by the improved generalization capability induced by solving multiple tasks simultaneously, which leads to a more robust shared representation. Nevertheless, finding optimal auxiliary tasks is a crucial problem that often requires hand-crafted solutions or expensive meta-learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Detaux, whereby a weakly supervised disentanglement procedure is used to discover a new unrelated auxiliary classification task, which allows us to go from a Single-Task Learning (STL) to a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. The disentanglement procedure works at the representation level, isolating the variation related to the principal task into an isolated subspace and additionally producing an arbitrary number of orthogonal subspaces, each one of them encouraging high separability among the projections. We generate the auxiliary classification task through a clustering procedure on the most disentangled subspace, obtaining a discrete set of labels. Subsequently, the original data, the labels associated with the principal task, and the newly discovered ones can be fed into any MTL framework. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real data, along with various ablation studies, demonstrate promising results, revealing the potential in what has been, so far, an unexplored connection between learning disentangled representations and MTL. The source code will be made available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Causal representation learning aims to unveil latent high-level causal representations from observed low-level data. One of its primary tasks is to provide reliable assurance of identifying these latent causal models, known as identifiability. A recent breakthrough explores identifiability by leveraging the change of causal influences among latent causal variables across multiple environments \citep{liu2022identifying}. However, this progress rests on the assumption that the causal relationships among latent causal variables adhere strictly to linear Gaussian models. In this paper, we extend the scope of latent causal models to involve nonlinear causal relationships, represented by polynomial models, and general noise distributions conforming to the exponential family. Additionally, we investigate the necessity of imposing changes on all causal parameters and present partial identifiability results when part of them remains unchanged. Further, we propose a novel empirical estimation method, grounded in our theoretical finding, that enables learning consistent latent causal representations. Our experimental results, obtained from both synthetic and real-world data, validate our theoretical contributions concerning identifiability and consistency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have succeeded significantly in various applications but remain susceptible to adversarial jailbreaks that void their safety guardrails. Previous attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities often rely on high-cost computational extrapolations, which may not be practical or efficient. In this paper, inspired by the authority influence demonstrated in the Milgram experiment, we present a lightweight method to take advantage of the LLMs' personification capabilities to construct $\textit{a virtual, nested scene}$, allowing it to realize an adaptive way to escape the usage control in a normal scenario. Empirically, the contents induced by our approach can achieve leading harmfulness rates with previous counterparts and realize a continuous jailbreak in subsequent interactions, which reveals the critical weakness of self-losing on both open-source and closed-source LLMs, $\textit{e.g.}$, Llama-2, Llama-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanghao Shi, Ning Wang, Yang Xiao, Chaoyu Zhang, Yi Shi, Y. Thomas Hou, Wenjing Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is known for its capability to safeguard the participants' data privacy. However, recently emerged model inversion attacks (MIAs) have shown that a malicious parameter server can reconstruct individual users' local data samples from model updates. The state-of-the-art attacks either rely on computation-intensive iterative optimization methods to reconstruct each input batch, making scaling difficult, or involve the malicious parameter server adding extra modules before the global model architecture, rendering the attacks too conspicuous and easily detectable.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Scale-MIA, a novel MIA capable of efficiently and accurately reconstructing local training samples from the aggregated model updates, even when the system is protected by a robust secure aggregation (SA) protocol. Scale-MIA utilizes the inner architecture of models and identifies the latent space as the critical layer for breaching privacy. Scale-MIA decomposes the complex reconstruction task into an innovative two-step process. The first step is to reconstruct the latent space representations (LSRs) from the aggregated model updates using a closed-form inversion mechanism, leveraging specially crafted linear layers. Then in the second step, the LSRs are fed into a fine-tuned generative decoder to reconstruct the whole input batch.
  We implemented Scale-MIA on commonly used machine learning models and conducted comprehensive experiments across various settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junping Hong, Ercan Engin Kuruoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning, Bayesian neural networks (BNN) provide the role of robustness analysis, and the minimax method is used to be a conservative choice in the traditional Bayesian field. In this paper, we study a conservative BNN with the minimax method and formulate a two-player game between a deterministic neural network $f$ and a sampling stochastic neural network $f + r*\xi$. From this perspective, we understand the closed-loop neural networks with the minimax loss and reveal their connection to the BNN. We test the models on simple data sets, study their robustness under noise perturbation, and report some issues for searching $r$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom F. Sterkenburg</p>
<p>Abstract: Statistical learning theory is often associated with the principle of Occam's razor, which recommends a simplicity preference in inductive inference. This paper distills the core argument for simplicity obtainable from statistical learning theory, built on the theory's central learning guarantee for the method of empirical risk minimization. This core "means-ends" argument is that a simpler hypothesis class or inductive model is better because it has better learning guarantees; however, these guarantees are model-relative and so the theoretical push towards simplicity is checked by our prior knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samar Hadou, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep unrolling, or unfolding, is an emerging learning-to-optimize method that unrolls a truncated iterative algorithm in the layers of a trainable neural network. However, the convergence guarantees and generalizability of the unrolled networks are still open theoretical problems. To tackle these problems, we provide deep unrolled architectures with a stochastic descent nature by imposing descending constraints during training. The descending constraints are forced layer by layer to ensure that each unrolled layer takes, on average, a descent step toward the optimum during training. We theoretically prove that the sequence constructed by the outputs of the unrolled layers is then guaranteed to converge for unseen problems, assuming no distribution shift between training and test problems. We also show that standard unrolling is brittle to perturbations, and our imposed constraints provide the unrolled networks with robustness to additive noise and perturbations. We numerically assess unrolled architectures trained under the proposed constraints in two different applications, including the sparse coding using learnable iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (LISTA) and image inpainting using proximal generative flow (GLOW-Prox), and demonstrate the performance and robustness benefits of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Sansone, Robin Manhaeve</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Chen, Wei Luo, Shunyu Liu, Yaoquan Wei, Yihe Zhou, Yunpeng Qing, Quan Zhang, Jie Song, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture tailored for learning robust power system state representations, which strives to optimize power dispatch for the power flow adjustment across different transmission sections. Specifically, our proposed approach, named Powerformer, develops a dedicated section-adaptive attention mechanism, separating itself from the self-attention used in conventional transformers. This mechanism effectively integrates power system states with transmission section information, which facilitates the development of robust state representations. Furthermore, by considering the graph topology of power system and the electrical attributes of bus nodes, we introduce two customized strategies to further enhance the expressiveness: graph neural network propagation and multi-factor attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three power system scenarios, including the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a large-scale European system with 9241 buses, where Powerformer demonstrates its superior performance over several baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchang Sun, Marios Kountouris, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted vivid attention as a privacy-preserving distributed learning framework. In this work, we focus on cross-silo FL, where clients become the model owners after training and are only concerned about the model's generalization performance on their local data. Due to the data heterogeneity issue, asking all the clients to join a single FL training process may result in model performance degradation. To investigate the effectiveness of collaboration, we first derive a generalization bound for each client when collaborating with others or when training independently. We show that the generalization performance of a client can be improved only by collaborating with other clients that have more training data and similar data distribution. Our analysis allows us to formulate a client utility maximization problem by partitioning clients into multiple collaborating groups. A hierarchical clustering-based collaborative training (HCCT) scheme is then proposed, which does not need to fix in advance the number of groups. We further analyze the convergence of HCCT for general non-convex loss functions which unveils the effect of data similarity among clients. Extensive simulations show that HCCT achieves better generalization performance than baseline schemes, whereas it degenerates to independent training and conventional FL in specific scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yige Li, Jiabo He, Hanxun Huang, Jun Sun, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks have become a significant threat to the pre-training and deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although numerous methods for detecting and mitigating backdoor attacks have been proposed, most rely on identifying and eliminating the ``shortcut" created by the backdoor, which links a specific source class to a target class. However, these approaches can be easily circumvented by designing multiple backdoor triggers that create shortcuts everywhere and therefore nowhere specific. In this study, we explore the concept of Multi-Trigger Backdoor Attacks (MTBAs), where multiple adversaries leverage different types of triggers to poison the same dataset. By proposing and investigating three types of multi-trigger attacks including \textit{parallel}, \textit{sequential}, and \textit{hybrid} attacks, we demonstrate that 1) multiple triggers can coexist, overwrite, or cross-activate one another, and 2) MTBAs easily break the prevalent shortcut assumption underlying most existing backdoor detection/removal methods, rendering them ineffective. Given the security risk posed by MTBAs, we have created a multi-trigger backdoor poisoning dataset to facilitate future research on detecting and mitigating these attacks, and we also discuss potential defense strategies against MTBAs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julius Vetter, Guy Moss, Cornelius Schr\"oder, Richard Gao, Jakob H. Macke</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific modeling applications often require estimating a distribution of parameters consistent with a dataset of observations - an inference task also known as source distribution estimation. This problem can be ill-posed, however, since many different source distributions might produce the same distribution of data-consistent simulations. To make a principled choice among many equally valid sources, we propose an approach which targets the maximum entropy distribution, i.e., prioritizes retaining as much uncertainty as possible. Our method is purely sample-based - leveraging the Sliced-Wasserstein distance to measure the discrepancy between the dataset and simulations - and thus suitable for simulators with intractable likelihoods. We benchmark our method on several tasks, and show that it can recover source distributions with substantially higher entropy than recent source estimation methods, without sacrificing the fidelity of the simulations. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we infer source distributions for parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model from experimental datasets with thousands of single-neuron measurements. In summary, we propose a principled method for inferring source distributions of scientific simulator parameters while retaining as much uncertainty as possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koby Hayashi, Sinan G. Aksoy, Grey Ballard, Haesun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) is a technique in data analysis and machine learning that approximates a symmetric matrix with a product of a nonnegative, low-rank matrix and its transpose. To design faster and more scalable algorithms for SymNMF we develop two randomized algorithms for its computation. The first algorithm uses randomized matrix sketching to compute an initial low-rank approximation to the input matrix and proceeds to rapidly compute a SymNMF of the approximation. The second algorithm uses randomized leverage score sampling to approximately solve constrained least squares problems. Many successful methods for SymNMF rely on (approximately) solving sequences of constrained least squares problems. We prove theoretically that leverage score sampling can approximately solve nonnegative least squares problems to a chosen accuracy with high probability. Additionally, we prove sampling complexity results for previously proposed hybrid sampling techniques which deterministically include high leverage score rows. This hybrid scheme is crucial for obtaining speeds ups in practice. Finally we demonstrate that both methods work well in practice by applying them to graph clustering tasks on large real world data sets. These experiments show that our methods approximately maintain solution quality and achieve significant speed ups for both large dense and large sparse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B\'alint Mucs\'anyi, Michael Kirchhof, Seong Joon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification, once a singular task, has evolved into a spectrum of tasks, including abstained prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. The latest goal is disentanglement: the construction of multiple estimators that are each tailored to one and only one source of uncertainty. This paper presents the first benchmark of uncertainty disentanglement. We reimplement and evaluate a comprehensive range of uncertainty estimators, from Bayesian over evidential to deterministic ones, across a diverse range of uncertainty tasks on ImageNet. We find that, despite recent theoretical endeavors, no existing approach provides pairs of disentangled uncertainty estimators in practice. We further find that specialized uncertainty tasks are harder than predictive uncertainty tasks, where we observe saturating performance. Our results provide both practical advice for which uncertainty estimators to use for which specific task, and reveal opportunities for future research toward task-centric and disentangled uncertainties.

<p>Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have accomplished much in the realm of generative AI. With the tremendous level of popularity the Generative AI algorithms have achieved, the demand for higher levels of performance continues to increase. Under this backdrop, careful scrutinization of algorithm performance under sample fidelity type measures is essential to ascertain how, effectively, the underlying structures of the data distribution were learned. In this context, minimizing the mean squared error between the additive and predicted noise alone does not impose structural integrity constraints on the predicted noise, for instance, isotropic. Under this premise, we were motivated to utilize the isotropy of the additive noise as a constraint on the objective function to enhance the fidelity of DDPMs. Our approach is simple and can be applied to any DDPM variant. We validate our approach by presenting experiments conducted on four synthetic 2D datasets as well as on unconditional image generation. As demonstrated by the results, the incorporation of this constraint improves the fidelity metrics, Precision and Density, and the results clearly indicate how the structural imposition was effective.</p>

We address (i) by allowing for both partial participation and local training, which significantly reduce the number of communication rounds between the central coordinator and computing agents. The algorithm matches the state of the art in the sense that the use of local training demonstrably does not impact accuracy. Additionally, agents have the flexibility to choose from various local training solvers, such as (stochastic) gradient descent and accelerated gradient descent. Further, we investigate how employing local training can enhance privacy, addressing point (ii). In particular, we derive differential privacy bounds and highlight their dependence on the number of local training epochs. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it to alternative techniques, considering both theoretical analysis and numerical results from a classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Liao, Fernando Porte-Agel, Jiannong Fang, Christian Rehtanz, Shouxiang Wang, Dechang Yang, Zhe Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models have made significant progress in load forecasting, but their forecast accuracy is limited in cases where historical load data is scarce. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueyan Niu, Bo Bai, Lei Deng, Wei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing the size of a Transformer does not always lead to enhanced performance. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the empirical scaling laws. Furthermore, the model's enhanced performance is closely associated with its memorization of the training samples. We present a theoretical framework that sheds light on the memorization during pre-training of transformer-based language models. We model the behavior of Transformers with associative memories using Hopfield networks, such that each transformer block effectively conducts an approximate nearest-neighbor search. In particular, the energy function in modern continuous Hopfield networks serves as an explanation for the attention mechanism, which we approximate with a distance-based energy function. By observing that the softmax function corresponds to the gradient of the LogSumExp function in the energy, and employing the majorization-minimization technique, we construct a global energy function designed to capture the layered architecture. We demonstrate a dependency between the model size and the dataset size for the model to achieve optimal performance, and we show that the achievable cross-entropy loss is bounded from below.</p>

We present three new algorithms: one robust model-based method and two sample-efficient model-free methods. Rather than basing our algorithms on Bellman's equation from dynamic programming, our work builds on Pontryagin's principle from the theory of open-loop optimal control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngkyoung Bae, Yeongwoo Song, Hawoong Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Zenn, Dominik Gond, Fabian Jirasek, Robert Bamler</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob E. Kooi, Mark Hoogendoorn, Vincent Fran\c{c}ois-Lavet</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation functions are one of the key components of a deep neural network. The most commonly used activation functions can be classed into the category of continuously differentiable (e.g. tanh) and piece-wise linear functions (e.g. ReLU), both having their own strengths and drawbacks with respect to downstream performance and representation capacity through learning (e.g. measured by the number of dead neurons and the effective rank). In reinforcement learning, the performance of continuously differentiable activations often falls short as compared to piece-wise linear functions. We provide insights into the vanishing gradients associated with the former, and show that the dying neuron problem is not exclusive to ReLU's. To alleviate vanishing gradients and the resulting dying neuron problem occurring with continuously differentiable activations, we propose a Hadamard representation. Using deep Q-networks, proximal policy optimization and parallelized Q-networks in the Atari domain, we show faster learning, a reduction in dead neurons and increased effective rank.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised learning (SSL) with Joint-Embedding Architectures (JEA) has led to outstanding performances. All instantiations of this paradigm were trained using strong and well-established hand-crafted data augmentations, leading to the general belief that they are required for the proper training and performance of such models. On the other hand, generative reconstruction-based models such as BEIT and MAE or Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures such as I-JEPA have shown strong performance without using data augmentations except masking. In this work, we challenge the importance of invariance and data-augmentation in JEAs at scale. By running a case-study on a recent SSL foundation model - DINOv2 - we show that strong image representations can be obtained with JEAs and only cropping without resizing provided the training data is large enough, reaching state-of-the-art results and using the least amount of augmentation in the literature. Through this study, we also discuss the impact of compute constraints on the outcomes of experimental deep learning research, showing that they can lead to very different conclusions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in deep learning have enabled physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. Numerical differentiation using the finite-difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings. In traditional computational fluid dynamics(CFD), body-fitted block-structured grids are often employed for complex flow cases when obtaining FD solutions. However, convolution operators in convolutional neural networks for FD are typically limited to single-block grids.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqin Chen, Mark S. Squillante, Chai Wah Wu, Santiago Paternain</p>
<p>Abstract: We devise a control-theoretic reinforcement learning approach to support direct learning of the optimal policy. We establish various theoretical properties of our approach, such as convergence and optimality of our analog of the Bellman operator and Q-learning, a new control-policy-variable gradient theorem, and a specific gradient ascent algorithm based on this theorem within the context of a specific control-theoretic framework. We empirically evaluate the performance of our control theoretic approach on several classical reinforcement learning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in solution quality, sample complexity, and running time of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Haider, Martin Ehler, Peter Balazs</p>
<p>Abstract: Injectivity is the defining property of a mapping that ensures no information is lost and any input can be perfectly reconstructed from its output. By performing hard thresholding, the ReLU function naturally interferes with this property, making the injectivity analysis of ReLU layers in neural networks a challenging yet intriguing task that has not yet been fully solved. This article establishes a frame theoretic perspective to approach this problem. The main objective is to develop a comprehensive characterization of the injectivity behavior of ReLU layers in terms of all three involved ingredients: (i) the weights, (ii) the bias, and (iii) the domain where the data is drawn from. Maintaining a focus on practical applications, we limit our attention to bounded domains and present two methods for numerically approximating a maximal bias for given weights and data domains. These methods provide sufficient conditions for the injectivity of a ReLU layer on those domains and yield a novel practical methodology for studying the information loss in ReLU layers. Finally, we derive explicit reconstruction formulas based on the duality concept from frame theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Obando-Ceron, Jo\~ao G. M. Ara\'ujo, Aaron Courville, Pablo Samuel Castro</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved tremendous success on various domains through a combination of algorithmic design and careful selection of hyper-parameters. Algorithmic improvements are often the result of iterative enhancements built upon prior approaches, while hyper-parameter choices are typically inherited from previous methods or fine-tuned specifically for the proposed technique. Despite their crucial impact on performance, hyper-parameter choices are frequently overshadowed by algorithmic advancements. This paper conducts an extensive empirical study focusing on the reliability of hyper-parameter selection for value-based deep reinforcement learning agents, including the introduction of a new score to quantify the consistency and reliability of various hyper-parameters. Our findings not only help establish which hyper-parameters are most critical to tune, but also help clarify which tunings remain consistent across different training regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Xie, Zhijie Lin, Kim-Chuan Toh, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: To efficiently train large-scale models, low-bit gradient communication compresses full-precision gradients on local GPU nodes into low-precision ones for higher gradient synchronization efficiency among GPU nodes. However, it often degrades training quality due to compression information loss. To address this, we propose the Low-bit Communication Adaptor (LoCo), which compensates gradients on local GPU nodes before compression, ensuring efficient synchronization without compromising training quality. Specifically, LoCo designs a moving average of historical compensation errors to stably estimate concurrent compression error and then adopts it to compensate for the concurrent gradient compression, yielding a less lossless compression. This mechanism allows it to be compatible with general optimizers like Adam and sharding strategies like FSDP. Theoretical analysis shows that integrating LoCo into full-precision optimizers like Adam and SGD does not impair their convergence speed on nonconvex problems. Experimental results show that across large-scale model training frameworks like Megatron-LM and PyTorch's FSDP, LoCo significantly improves communication efficiency, e.g., improving Adam's training speed by 14% to 40% without performance degradation on large language models like LLAMAs and MoE.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces an open source simulator for packet routing in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations (LSatCs) considering the dynamic system uncertainties. The simulator, implemented in Python, supports traditional Dijkstra's based routing as well as more advanced learning solutions, specifically Q-Routing and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) from our previous work. It uses an event-based approach with the SimPy module to accurately simulate packet creation, routing and queuing, providing real-time tracking of queues and latency. The simulator is highly configurable, allowing adjustments in routing policies, traffic, ground and space layer topologies, communication parameters, and learning hyperparameters. Key features include the ability to visualize system motion and track packet paths. Results highlight significant improvements in end-to-end (E2E) latency using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based routing policies compared to traditional methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingru Li, Jiawei Xu, Baoxiang Wang, Zhi-Quan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable exploration in high-dimensional, complex environments is a significant challenge in sequential decision making, especially when utilizing neural networks. Ensemble sampling, a practical approximation of Thompson sampling, is widely adopted but often suffers performance degradation due to {ensemble coupling} in shared layer architectures, leading to reduced diversity and ineffective exploration. In this paper, we introduce Ensemble++, a novel method that addresses these challenges through architectural and algorithmic innovations. To prevent ensemble coupling, Ensemble++ decouples mean and uncertainty estimation by separating the base network and ensemble components, employs a symmetrized loss function and the stop-gradient operator. To further enhance exploration, it generates richer hypothesis spaces through random linear combinations of ensemble components using continuous index sampling. Theoretically, we prove that Ensemble++ matches the regret bounds of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits while maintaining a scalable per-step computational complexity of $\tilde{O}( \log T)$. This provides the first rigorous analysis demonstrating that ensemble sampling can be an scalable and effective approximation to Thompson Sampling, closing a key theoretical gap in exploration efficiency. Empirically, we demonstrate Ensemble++'s effectiveness in both regret minimization and computational efficiency across a range of nonlinear bandit environments, including a language-based contextual bandits where the agents employ GPT backbones. Our results highlight the capability of Ensemble++ for real-time adaptation in complex environments where computational and data collection budgets are constrained. \url{https://github.com/szrlee/Ensemble_Plus_Plus}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleksii Kachaiev, Stefano Recanatesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianfei Li, Han Feng, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore intersections between sparse coding and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wall Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequence modeling with State Space models (SSMs) has demonstrated performance surpassing that of Transformers in various tasks, raising expectations for their potential to outperform the Decision Transformer and its enhanced variants in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself. This novel modification to Mamba's input layer represents a departure from conventional timestamp-based encoding approaches used in Transformers. By enhancing performance of Mamba in offline RL, characterized by memory efficiency and fast inference, this work opens new avenues for its broader application in future RL research.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13871">AlphaViT: A Flexible Game-Playing AI for Multiple Games and Variable Board Sizes</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuhisa Fujita</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents novel game-playing AI agents based on the AlphaZero framework, enhanced with Vision Transformer (ViT): AlphaViT, AlphaViD, and AlphaVDA. These agents are designed to play multiple board games of various sizes using a single network with shared weights, thereby overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed-board-size constraints. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both transformer encoders and decoders. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses a learnable embeddings as the decoder input. The additional decoder layers in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provide flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search and approach the performance of AlphaZero, despite using a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT shows strong performance across all tested games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN using pre-trained weights from small-board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures to develop more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Liu, Yang Bai, Chengcheng Han, Rongxiang Weng, Jun Xu, Xuezhi Cao, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely utilized in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) phase to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, thereby enhancing both their harmlessness and efficacy. However, it has been observed that DPO tends to over-optimize for verbosity, which can detrimentally affect both performance and user experience. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth theoretical analysis of DPO's optimization objective and reveal a strong correlation between its implicit reward and data length. This correlation misguides the optimization direction, resulting in length sensitivity during the DPO training and leading to verbosity. To address this issue, we propose a length-desensitization improvement method for DPO, termed LD-DPO. The proposed method aims to desensitize DPO to data length by decoupling explicit length preference, which is relatively insignificant, from the other implicit preferences, thereby enabling more effective learning of the intrinsic preferences. We utilized two settings (Base and Instruct) of Llama2-13B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2-7B for experimental validation on various benchmarks including MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2. The experimental results indicate that LD-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and other baseline methods, achieving more concise responses with a 10-40% reduction in length compared to DPO. We conducted in-depth experimental analyses to demonstrate that LD-DPO can indeed achieve length desensitization and align the model more closely with human-like preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miguel Costa, Morten W. Petersen, Arthur Vandervoort, Martin Drews, Karyn Morrissey, Francisco C. Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, which contribute to urban flooding, are expected to increase in many places. These floods can damage transport infrastructure and disrupt mobility, highlighting the need for cities to adapt to escalating risks. Reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a powerful tool for uncovering optimal adaptation strategies, determining how and where to deploy adaptation measures effectively, even under significant uncertainty. In this study, we leverage RL to identify the most effective timing and locations for implementing measures, aiming to reduce both direct and indirect impacts of flooding. Our framework integrates climate change projections of future rainfall events and floods, models city-wide motorized trips, and quantifies direct and indirect impacts on infrastructure and mobility. Preliminary results suggest that our RL-based approach can significantly enhance decision-making by prioritizing interventions in specific urban areas and identifying the optimal periods for their implementation.

<p>Abstract: The introduction of Transformers in 2017 reshaped the landscape of deep learning. Originally proposed for sequence modelling, Transformers have since achieved widespread success across various domains. However, the scalability limitations of Transformers - particularly with respect to sequence length - have sparked renewed interest in novel recurrent models that are parallelizable during training, offer comparable performance, and scale more effectively. In this work, we revisit sequence modelling from a historical perspective, focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which dominated the field for two decades before the rise of Transformers. Specifically, we examine LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). We demonstrate that by simplifying these models, we can derive minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts, (2) are fully parallelizable during training, and (3) achieve surprisingly competitive performance on a range of tasks, rivalling recent models including Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Chen, Shujie Wang, Difan Zou, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this field aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to memorize training data than unconditional DPMs. And most data extraction methods developed so far target conditional DPMs. Although unconditional DPMs are less prone to data extraction, further investigation into these attacks remains essential since they serve as the foundation for conditional models like Stable Diffusion, and exploring these attacks will enhance our understanding of memorization in DPMs. In this work, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on generated data as surrogate conditions to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that it can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs and why SIDE is effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Cloud, Jacob Goldman-Wetzler, Ev\v{z}en Wybitul, Joseph Miller, Alexander Matt Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are trained primarily based on their inputs and outputs, without regard for their internal mechanisms. These neglected mechanisms determine properties that are critical for safety, like (i) transparency; (ii) the absence of sensitive information or harmful capabilities; and (iii) reliable generalization of goals beyond the training distribution. To address this shortcoming, we introduce gradient routing, a training method that isolates capabilities to specific subregions of a neural network. Gradient routing applies data-dependent, weighted masks to gradients during backpropagation. These masks are supplied by the user in order to configure which parameters are updated by which data points. We show that gradient routing can be used to (1) learn representations which are partitioned in an interpretable way; (2) enable robust unlearning via ablation of a pre-specified network subregion; and (3) achieve scalable oversight of a reinforcement learner by localizing modules responsible for different behaviors. Throughout, we find that gradient routing localizes capabilities even when applied to a limited, ad-hoc subset of the data. We conclude that the approach holds promise for challenging, real-world applications where quality data are scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Haocheng Yin, Heng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification (arXiv:2008.08186), we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar law of clustering in the visual representation space. Specifically, in discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels; in continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to "control-oriented" classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO).
  Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) training algorithm for shallow neural networks, building upon the work introduced in "Adaptive Random Fourier Features with Metropolis Sampling", Kammonen et al., \emph{Foundations of Data Science}, 2(3):309--332, 2020. This improved method uses a particle filter-type resampling technique to stabilize the training process and reduce the sensitivity to parameter choices. The Metropolis test can also be omitted when resampling is used, reducing the number of hyperparameters by one and reducing the computational cost per iteration compared to the ARFF method. We present comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in function regression tasks as a stand-alone method and as a pretraining step before gradient-based optimization, using the Adam optimizer. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to a simple image regression problem, illustrating its utility in sampling frequencies for the random Fourier features (RFF) layer of coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons. In this context, we use the proposed algorithm to sample the parameters of the RFF layer in an automated manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyuan Ma, Cheng Ji, Jingde Wang, Wei Sun, Xun Tang, Zheyu Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce MOLA: a Multi-block Orthogonal Long short-term memory Autoencoder paradigm, to conduct accurate, reliable fault detection of industrial processes. To achieve this, MOLA effectively extracts dynamic orthogonal features by introducing an orthogonality-based loss function to constrain the latent space output. This helps eliminate the redundancy in the features identified, thereby improving the overall monitoring performance. On top of this, a multi-block monitoring structure is proposed, which categorizes the process variables into multiple blocks by leveraging expert process knowledge about their associations with the overall process. Each block is associated with its specific Orthogonal Long short-term memory Autoencoder model, whose extracted dynamic orthogonal features are monitored by distance-based Hotelling's $T^2$ statistics and quantile-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) designed for multivariate data streams that are nonparametric, heterogeneous in nature. Compared to having a single model accounting for all process variables, such a multi-block structure improves the overall process monitoring performance significantly, especially for large-scale industrial processes. Finally, we propose an adaptive weight-based Bayesian fusion (W-BF) framework to aggregate all block-wise monitoring statistics into a global statistic that we monitor for faults, with the goal of improving fault detection speed by assigning weights to blocks based on the sequential order where alarms are raised. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our MOLA framework by applying it to the Tennessee Eastman Process and comparing the performance with various benchmark methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamesh R</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to their impressive capabilities as few-shot learners. Recent techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, have significantly advanced multi-step reasoning by introducing step-by-step decomposition, achieving state-of-the-art results on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, these approaches often rely on static prompting templates that do not adapt to task complexity or errors during the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Prompting, a dynamic and iterative framework designed to enhance reasoning by incorporating real-time adjustments to prompt structures and validation mechanisms.Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Prompting significantly improves performance on diverse reasoning benchmarks, including arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, MultiArith), logical reasoning and commonsense tasks, achieving substantial accuracy gains compared to static prompting baselines. By integrating guided prompts, intermediate validation, and self-corrective steps, our approach enables smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger counterparts, such as GPT-4, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework achieves this without requiring fine-tuning or task-specific training data, highlighting the untapped potential of iterative reasoning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Scholten, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction provides model-agnostic and distribution-free uncertainty quantification through prediction sets that are guaranteed to include the ground truth with any user-specified probability. Yet, conformal prediction is not reliable under poisoning attacks where adversaries manipulate both training and calibration data, which can significantly alter prediction sets in practice. As a solution, we propose reliable prediction sets (RPS): the first efficient method for constructing conformal prediction sets with provable reliability guarantees under poisoning. To ensure reliability under training poisoning, we introduce smoothed score functions that reliably aggregate predictions of classifiers trained on distinct partitions of the training data. To ensure reliability under calibration poisoning, we construct multiple prediction sets, each calibrated on distinct subsets of the calibration data. We then aggregate them into a majority prediction set, which includes a class only if it appears in a majority of the individual sets. Both proposed aggregations mitigate the influence of datapoints in the training and calibration data on the final prediction set. We experimentally validate our approach on image classification tasks, achieving strong reliability while maintaining utility and preserving coverage on clean data. Overall, our approach represents an important step towards more trustworthy uncertainty quantification in the presence of data poisoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground. In this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. This multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts. Each data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph. Using message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. Our approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Hoffmann, Kailash Budhathoki, Matthaeus Kleindessner</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolving capabilities of large language models are accompanied by growing sizes and deployment costs, necessitating effective inference optimisation techniques. We propose a novel pruning method utilising centrality measures from graph theory, reducing both the computational requirements and the memory footprint of these models. Specifically, we devise a method for creating a weighted directed acyclical graph representation of multilayer perceptrons to which we apply a modified version of the weighted PageRank centrality measure to compute node importance scores. In combination with uniform pruning this leads to structured sparsity. We call this pruning method MLPRank. Furthermore we introduce an extension to decoder-only transformer models and call it LLMRank. For both variants we demonstrate a strong performance. With MLPRank on average leading to 6.09 % higher accuracy retention than three popular baselines and 13.42 % with LLMRank compared to two popular baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raisa Bentay Hossain, Farid Ahmed, Kazuma Kobayashi, Seid Koric, Diab Abueidda, Syed Bahauddin Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective real-time monitoring is a foundation of digital twin technology, crucial for detecting material degradation and maintaining the structural integrity of nuclear systems to ensure both safety and operational efficiency. Traditional physical sensor systems face limitations such as installation challenges, high costs, and difficulty measuring critical parameters in hard-to-reach or harsh environments, often resulting in incomplete data coverage. Machine learning-driven virtual sensors, integrated within a digital twin framework, offer a transformative solution by enhancing physical sensor capabilities to monitor critical degradation indicators like pressure, velocity, and turbulence. However, conventional machine learning models struggle with real-time monitoring due to the high-dimensional nature of reactor data and the need for frequent retraining. This paper introduces the use of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) as a core component of a digital twin framework to predict key thermal-hydraulic parameters in the hot leg of an AP-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). DeepONet serves as a dynamic and scalable virtual sensor by accurately mapping the interplay between operational input parameters and spatially distributed system behaviors. In this study, DeepONet is trained with different operational conditions, which relaxes the requirement of continuous retraining, making it suitable for online and real-time prediction components for digital twin. Our results show that DeepONet achieves accurate predictions with low mean squared error and relative L2 error and can make predictions on unknown data 1400 times faster than traditional CFD simulations. This speed and accuracy enable DeepONet to synchronize with the physical system in real-time, functioning as a dynamic virtual sensor that tracks degradation-contributing conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kento Nishi, Maya Okawa, Rahul Ramesh, Mikail Khona, Hidenori Tanaka, Ekdeep Singh Lubana</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) algorithms alter models' weights to perform targeted updates to incorrect, outdated, or otherwise unwanted factual associations. To better identify the possibilities and limitations of these approaches, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' factual recall accuracy and diminish their general reasoning abilities. While these studies give broad insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., via performance evaluations on benchmarks, we argue little is understood as to why such destructive failures occur. Is it possible KE methods distort representations of concepts beyond the targeted fact, hence hampering abilities at broad? If so, what is the extent of this distortion? Motivated by such questions, we define a novel synthetic task wherein a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities in the graph (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models and analysis of extracted representations, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it results in degradation of factual recall and reasoning performance more broadly. To corroborate our findings in a more naturalistic setup, we perform preliminary experiments with pretrained GPT-2-XL and Mamba models, reproducing the representation shattering effect therein as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katharina Friedl, No\'emie Jaquier, Jens Lundell, Tamim Asfour, Danica Kragic</p>
<p>Abstract: By incorporating physical consistency as inductive bias, deep neural networks display increased generalization capabilities and data efficiency in learning nonlinear dynamic models. However, the complexity of these models generally increases with the system dimensionality, requiring larger datasets, more complex deep networks, and significant computational effort. We propose a novel geometric network architecture to learn physically-consistent reduced-order dynamic parameters that accurately describe the original high-dimensional system behavior. This is achieved by building on recent advances in model-order reduction and by adopting a Riemannian perspective to jointly learn a non-linear structure-preserving latent space and the associated low-dimensional dynamics. Our approach enables accurate long-term predictions of the high-dimensional dynamics of rigid and deformable systems with increased data efficiency by inferring interpretable and physically plausible reduced Lagrangian models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc Kieu, Tung Kieu, Peng Han, Bin Yang, Christian S. Jensen, Bac Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the global trend towards urbanization, people increasingly move to and live in cities that then continue to grow. Traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent transportation systems of cities as well as in spatio-temporal data mining. State-of-the-art forecasting is achieved by deep-learning approaches due to their ability to contend with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, existing methods assume the input is fixed-topology road networks and static traffic time series. These assumptions fail to align with urbanization, where time series are collected continuously and road networks evolve over time. In such settings, deep-learning models require frequent re-initialization and re-training, imposing high computational costs. To enable much more efficient training without jeopardizing model accuracy, we propose the Topological Evolution-aware Framework (TEAM) for traffic forecasting that incorporates convolution and attention. This combination of mechanisms enables better adaptation to newly collected time series, while being able to maintain learned knowledge from old time series. TEAM features a continual learning module based on the Wasserstein metric that acts as a buffer that can identify the most stable and the most changing network nodes. Then, only data related to stable nodes is employed for re-training when consolidating a model. Further, only data of new nodes and their adjacent nodes as well as data pertaining to changing nodes are used to re-train the model. Empirical studies with two real-world traffic datasets offer evidence that TEAM is capable of much lower re-training costs than existing methods are, without jeopardizing forecasting accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanan Mahammadli, Seyda Bolelli Ertekin</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces SLLMBO, an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), incorporating dynamic search space adaptability, enhanced parameter landscape exploitation, and a hybrid, novel LLM-Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (LLM-TPE) sampler. By addressing limitations in recent fully LLM-based methods and traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO), SLLMBO achieves more robust optimization. This comprehensive benchmarking evaluates multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet-3.5, and Gemini-1.5-flash, extending prior work beyond GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and establishing SLLMBO as the first framework to benchmark a diverse set of LLMs for HPO. By integrating LLMs' established strengths in parameter initialization with the exploitation abilities demonstrated in this study, alongside TPE's exploration capabilities, the LLM-TPE sampler achieves a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, reduces API costs, and mitigates premature early stoppings for more effective parameter searches. Across 14 tabular tasks in classification and regression, the LLM-TPE sampler outperformed fully LLM-based methods and achieved superior results over BO methods in 9 tasks. Testing early stopping in budget-constrained scenarios further demonstrated competitive performance, indicating that LLM-based methods generally benefit from extended iterations for optimal results. This work lays the foundation for future research exploring open-source LLMs, reproducibility of LLM results in HPO, and benchmarking SLLMBO on complex datasets, such as image classification, segmentation, and machine translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carl Allen</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentanglement, or identifying salient statistically independent factors of the data, is of interest in many areas of machine learning and statistics, such as synthetic data generation with controlled properties, robust classification of features, parsimonious encoding, and improving our understanding of the generative process underlying the data. Disentanglement is observed in several generative paradigms, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Particular progress has recently been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where the choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is proposed to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We continue this thread to show how such linear independence translates to statistical independence, completing the chain in understanding how the VAE's objective identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Peri, Alessio Russo, Gabor Fodor, Pablo Soldati</p>
<p>Abstract: Link adaptation (LA) is an essential function in modern wireless communication systems that dynamically adjusts the transmission rate of a communication link to match time- and frequency-varying radio link conditions. However, factors such as user mobility, fast fading, imperfect channel quality information, and aging of measurements make the modeling of LA challenging. To bypass the need for explicit modeling, recent research has introduced online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches as an alternative to the more commonly used rule-based algorithms. Yet, RL-based approaches face deployment challenges, as training in live networks can potentially degrade real-time performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL as a candidate to learn LA policies with minimal effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformer. Our results show that offline RL algorithms can match the performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonggeun Han, Sehwan Kim, Hyungjun Joo, Sangwoo Hong, Jungwoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedict Aaron Tjandra, Federico Barbero, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the successful application of Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) for tasks such as dynamic node classification and link prediction, they still perform poorly on the task of dynamic node affinity prediction -- where the goal is to predict 'how much' two nodes will interact in the future. In fact, simple heuristic approaches such as persistent forecasts and moving averages over ground-truth labels significantly and consistently outperform TGNs. Building on this observation, we find that computing heuristics over messages is an equally competitive approach, outperforming TGN and all current temporal graph (TG) models on dynamic node affinity prediction. In this paper, we prove that no formulation of TGN can represent persistent forecasting or moving averages over messages, and propose to enhance the expressivity of TGNs by adding source-target identification to each interaction event message. We show that this modification is required to represent persistent forecasting, moving averages, and the broader class of autoregressive models over messages. Our proposed method, TGNv2, significantly outperforms TGN and all current TG models on all Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) dynamic node affinity prediction datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical heterogeneity is a measure of how skewed the samples of a dataset are. It is a common problem in the study of differential privacy that the usage of a statistically heterogeneous dataset results in a significant loss of accuracy. In federated scenarios, statistical heterogeneity is more likely to happen, and so the above problem is even more pressing. We explore the three most promising ways to measure statistical heterogeneity and give formulae for their accuracy, while simultaneously incorporating differential privacy. We find the optimum privacy parameters via an analytic mechanism, which incorporates root finding methods. We validate the main theorems and related hypotheses experimentally, and test the robustness of the analytic mechanism to different heterogeneity levels. The analytic mechanism in a distributed setting delivers superior accuracy to all combinations involving the classic mechanism and/or the centralized setting. All measures of statistical heterogeneity do not lose significant accuracy when a heterogeneous sample is used.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel J. Bell, Skyler Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning correlations from data forms the foundation of today's machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. While such an approach enables the automatic discovery of patterned relationships within big data corpora, it is susceptible to failure modes when unintended correlations are captured. This vulnerability has expanded interest in interrogating spuriousness, often critiqued as an impediment to model performance, fairness, and robustness. In this article, we trace deviations from the conventional definition of statistical spuriousness-which denotes a non-causal observation arising from either coincidence or confounding variables-to articulate how ML researchers make sense of spuriousness in practice. Drawing on a broad survey of ML literature, we conceptualize the "multiple dimensions of spuriousness," encompassing: relevance ("Models should only use correlations that are relevant to the task."), generalizability ("Models should only use correlations that generalize to unseen data"), human-likeness ("Models should only use correlations that a human would use to perform the same task"), and harmfulness ("Models should only use correlations that are not harmful"). These dimensions demonstrate that ML spuriousness goes beyond the causal/non-causal dichotomy and that the disparate interpretative paths researchers choose could meaningfully influence the trajectory of ML development. By underscoring how a fundamental problem in ML is contingently negotiated in research contexts, we contribute to ongoing debates about responsible practices in AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangfan Yang, Junkai Ji, Shan He, Jianqiang Li, Tiantian He, Ruibin Bai, Zexuan Zhu, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial a crucial step in drug development, which enables the virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest. However, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases as the size of the compound library increases. Recently, deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53% and 82.71% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. In particular, we provide a method based on hypothesis testing coupled with differential privacy and data variance estimation. Two privacy mechanisms and two data variance estimation schemes are proposed, and we provide a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data. Moreover, we provide analytical performance curves for the case with an oracle class estimator, i.e., the class structure of the agents, where agents receiving data from distributions with the same mean are considered to be in the same class, is known. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to ideal performance where all data is public. This illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting.</p>

To address this challenge, we introduce OWLed, the Outlier-Weighed Layerwise Pruning for Efficient Autonomous Driving Framework that leverages outlier-weighted layerwise sparsity for model compression. Our method assigns non-uniform sparsity ratios to different layers based on the distribution of outlier features, significantly reducing the model size without the need for fine-tuning. To ensure the compressed model adapts well to autonomous driving tasks, we incorporate driving environment data into both the calibration and pruning processes. Our empirical studies reveal that the encoder component is more sensitive to pruning than the LLM, highlighting its critical role in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that OWLed outperforms existing methods in perception, action prediction, and language understanding while substantially lowering computational requirements. These findings underscore the potential of combining advanced pruning techniques with LLMs to develop efficient and robust autonomous driving systems capable of handling complex scenarios. Code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlong Mou, Jian Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Bootstrapping and rollout are two fundamental principles for value function estimation in reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce a novel class of Bellman operators, called subgraph Bellman operators, that interpolate between bootstrapping and rollout methods. Our estimator, derived by solving the fixed point of the empirical subgraph Bellman operator, combines the strengths of the bootstrapping-based temporal difference (TD) estimator and the rollout-based Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Specifically, the error upper bound of our estimator approaches the optimal variance achieved by TD, with an additional term depending on the exit probability of a selected subset of the state space. At the same time, the estimator exhibits the finite-sample adaptivity of MC, with sample complexity depending only on the occupancy measure of this subset. We complement the upper bound with an information-theoretic lower bound, showing that the additional term is unavoidable given a reasonable sample size. Together, these results establish subgraph Bellman estimators as an optimal and adaptive framework for reconciling TD and MC methods in policy evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Li, Xiaoang Xu, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model evolution enables learning from feedback to refine experiences and update skills, transforming models from having no domain knowledge to becoming domain experts. However, there is currently no unified and effective method for guiding this evolutionary process. To address this gap, we propose the Meteor method, which includes three training phases: weak-to-strong data distillation, iterative training, and self-evolution strategies. Each phase maximizes the model's inherent domain capabilities, allowing it to autonomously refine its domain knowledge and enhance performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy, completeness, relevance, coherence, and reliability across domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silin Zhou, Shuo Shang, Lisi Chen, Christian S. Jensen, Panos Kalnis</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vectors that can then be used for various downstream tasks, including trajectory similarity computation, trajectory classification, and travel-time estimation. However, existing TRL methods often produce vectors that, when used in downstream tasks, yield insufficiently accurate results. A key reason is that they fail to utilize the comprehensive information encompassed by trajectories. We propose a self-supervised TRL framework, called RED, which effectively exploits multiple types of trajectory information. Overall, RED adopts the Transformer as the backbone model and masks the constituting paths in trajectories to train a masked autoencoder (MAE). In particular, RED considers the moving patterns of trajectories by employing a Road-aware masking strategy} that retains key paths of trajectories during masking, thereby preserving crucial information of the trajectories. RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to encode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model inputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the Transformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the Transformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the spatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention mechanism of the Transformer. We compare RED with 9 state-of-the-art TRL methods for 4 downstream tasks on 3 real-world datasets, finding that RED can usually improve the accuracy of the best-performing baseline by over 5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corrado Coppola, Lorenzo Papa, Irene Amerini, Laura Palagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods have been increasingly adopted by deep learning community due to their fast convergence and reduced sensitivity to hyper-parameters. However, these methods come with limitations, such as increased memory requirements for elements like moving averages and a poorly understood convergence theory. To overcome these challenges, we introduce F-CMA, a Fast-Controlled Mini-batch Algorithm with a random reshuffling method featuring a sufficient decrease condition and a line-search procedure to ensure loss reduction per epoch, along with its deterministic proof of global convergence to a stationary point. To evaluate the F-CMA, we integrate it into conventional training protocols for classification tasks involving both convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models, allowing for a direct comparison with popular optimizers. Computational tests show significant improvements, including a decrease in the overall training time by up to 68%, an increase in per-epoch efficiency by up to 20%, and in model accuracy by up to 5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mary Scott, Sayan Biswas, Graham Cormode, Carsten Maple</p>
<p>Abstract: A key task in managing distributed, sensitive data is to measure the extent to which a distribution changes. Understanding this drift can effectively support a variety of federated learning and analytics tasks. However, in many practical settings sharing such information can be undesirable (e.g., for privacy concerns) or infeasible (e.g., for high communication costs). In this work, we describe novel algorithmic approaches for estimating the KL divergence of data across federated models of computation, under differential privacy. We analyze their theoretical properties and present an empirical study of their performance. We explore parameter settings that optimize the accuracy of the algorithm catering to each of the settings; these provide sub-variations that are applicable to real-world tasks, addressing different context- and application-specific trust level requirements. Our experimental results confirm that our private estimators achieve accuracy comparable to a baseline algorithm without differential privacy guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Wang, Qing Yu, Yancun Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Bike-sharing is an environmentally friendly shared mobility mode, but its self-loop phenomenon, where bikes are returned to the same station after several time usage, significantly impacts equity in accessing its services. Therefore, this study conducts a multiscale analysis with a spatial autoregressive model and double machine learning framework to assess socioeconomic features and geospatial location's impact on the self-loop phenomenon at metro stations and street scales. The results reveal that bike-sharing self-loop intensity exhibits significant spatial lag effect at street scale and is positively associated with residential land use. Marginal treatment effects of residential land use is higher on streets with middle-aged residents, high fixed employment, and low car ownership. The multimodal public transit condition reveals significant positive marginal treatment effects at both scales. To enhance bike-sharing cooperation, we advocate augmenting bicycle availability in areas with high metro usage and low bus coverage, alongside implementing adaptable redistribution strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zan Ahmad, Shiyi Chen, Minglang Yin, Avisha Kumar, Nicolas Charon, Natalia Trayanova, Mauro Maggioni</p>
<p>Abstract: A computed approximation of the solution operator to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) is needed in various areas of science and engineering. Neural operators have been shown to be quite effective at predicting these solution generators after training on high-fidelity ground truth data (e.g. numerical simulations). However, in order to generalize well to unseen spatial domains, neural operators must be trained on an extensive amount of geometrically varying data samples that may not be feasible to acquire or simulate in certain contexts (e.g., patient-specific medical data, large-scale computationally intensive simulations.) We propose that in order to learn a PDE solution operator that can generalize across multiple domains without needing to sample enough data expressive enough for all possible geometries, we can train instead a latent neural operator on just a few ground truth solution fields diffeomorphically mapped from different geometric/spatial domains to a fixed reference configuration. Furthermore, the form of the solutions is dependent on the choice of mapping to and from the reference domain. We emphasize that preserving properties of the differential operator when constructing these mappings can significantly reduce the data requirement for achieving an accurate model due to the regularity of the solution fields that the latent neural operator is training on. We provide motivating numerical experimentation that demonstrates an extreme case of this consideration by exploiting the conformal invariance of the Laplacian</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanxue Dong, Maria De-arteaga, Maytal Saar-Tsechansky</p>
<p>Abstract: Biased human decisions have consequential impacts across various domains, yielding unfair treatment of individuals and resulting in suboptimal outcomes for organizations and society. In recognition of this fact, organizations regularly design and deploy interventions aimed at mitigating these biases. However, measuring human decision biases remains an important but elusive task. Organizations are frequently concerned with mistaken decisions disproportionately affecting one group. In practice, however, this is typically not possible to assess due to the scarcity of a gold standard: a label that indicates what the correct decision would have been. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to assess bias in human-generated decisions when gold standard labels are scarce. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of our method over existing alternatives. This proposed methodology establishes a foundation for transparency in human decision-making, carrying substantial implications for managerial duties, and offering potential for alleviating algorithmic biases when human decisions are used as labels to train algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghui Xu, Hanyin Cheng, Chenjuan Guo, Hongfan Gao, Jilin Hu, Sean Bin Yang, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing effective path representations has become increasingly essential across various fields within intelligent transportation. Although pre-trained path representation learning models have shown improved performance, they predominantly focus on the topological structures from single modality data, i.e., road networks, overlooking the geometric and contextual features associated with path-related images, e.g., remote sensing images. Similar to human understanding, integrating information from multiple modalities can provide a more comprehensive view, enhancing both representation accuracy and generalization. However, variations in information granularity impede the semantic alignment of road network-based paths (road paths) and image-based paths (image paths), while the heterogeneity of multi-modal data poses substantial challenges for effective fusion and utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal, Multi-granularity Path Representation Learning Framework (MM-Path), which can learn a generic path representation by integrating modalities from both road paths and image paths. To enhance the alignment of multi-modal data, we develop a multi-granularity alignment strategy that systematically associates nodes, road sub-paths, and road paths with their corresponding image patches, ensuring the synchronization of both detailed local information and broader global contexts. To address the heterogeneity of multi-modal data effectively, we introduce a graph-based cross-modal residual fusion component designed to comprehensively fuse information across different modalities and granularities. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets under two downstream tasks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed MM-Path.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasin I. Tepeli, Mathijs de Wolf, Joana P. Gon\c{c}alves</p>
<p>Abstract: Selection bias poses a critical challenge for fairness in machine learning, as models trained on data that is less representative of the population might exhibit undesirable behavior for underrepresented profiles. Semi-supervised learning strategies like self-training can mitigate selection bias by incorporating unlabeled data into model training to gain further insight into the distribution of the population. However, conventional self-training seeks to include high-confidence data samples, which may reinforce existing model bias and compromise effectiveness. We propose Metric-DST, a diversity-guided self-training strategy that leverages metric learning and its implicit embedding space to counter confidence-based bias through the inclusion of more diverse samples. Metric-DST learned more robust models in the presence of selection bias for generated and real-world datasets with induced bias, as well as a molecular biology prediction task with intrinsic bias. The Metric-DST learning strategy offers a flexible and widely applicable solution to mitigate selection bias and enhance fairness of machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengkui Zhao, Trung Hieu Nguyen, Bin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep complex U-Net structure and convolutional recurrent network (CRN) structure achieve state-of-the-art performance for monaural speech enhancement. Both deep complex U-Net and CRN are encoder and decoder structures with skip connections, which heavily rely on the representation power of the complex-valued convolutional layers. In this paper, we propose a complex convolutional block attention module (CCBAM) to boost the representation power of the complex-valued convolutional layers by constructing more informative features. The CCBAM is a lightweight and general module which can be easily integrated into any complex-valued convolutional layers. We integrate CCBAM with the deep complex U-Net and CRN to enhance their performance for speech enhancement. We further propose a mixed loss function to jointly optimize the complex models in both time-frequency (TF) domain and time domain. By integrating CCBAM and the mixed loss, we form a new end-to-end (E2E) complex speech enhancement framework. Ablation experiments and objective evaluations show the superior performance of the proposed approaches (https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio).</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the potential of tensor network based machine learning methods to scale to large image and text data sets. For that, we study how the mutual information between a subregion and its complement scales with the subsystem size $L$, similarly to how it is done in quantum many-body physics. We find that for text, the mutual information scales as a power law $L^\nu$ with a close to volume law exponent, indicating that text cannot be efficiently described by 1D tensor networks. For images, the scaling is close to an area law, hinting at 2D tensor networks such as PEPS could have an adequate expressibility. For the numerical analysis, we introduce a mutual information estimator based on autoregressive networks, and we also use convolutional neural networks in a neural estimator method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'ictor Blanco, Alberto Jap\'on, Justo Puerto, Peter Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Weighted Optimal Classification Forests (WOCFs), a new family of classifiers that takes advantage of an optimal ensemble of decision trees to derive accurate and interpretable classifiers. We propose a novel mathematical optimization-based methodology which simultaneously constructs a given number of trees, each of them providing a predicted class for the observations in the feature space. The classification rule is derived by assigning to each observation its most frequently predicted class among the trees. We provide a mixed integer linear programming formulation (MIP) for the problem and several novel MIP strengthening / scaling techniques. We report the results of our computational experiments, from which we conclude that our method has equal or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art tree-based classification methods for small to medium-sized instances. We also present three real-world case studies showing that our methodology has very interesting implications in terms of interpretability. Overall, WOCFs complement existing methods such as CART, Optimal Classification Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost. In addition to its Pareto improvement on accuracy and interpretability, we also see unique properties emerging in terms of different trees focusing on different feature variables. This provides nontrivial improvement in interpretability and usability of the trained model in terms of counterfactual explanation. Thus, despite the apparent computational challenge of WOCFs that limit the size of the problems that can be efficiently solved with current MIP, this is an important research direction that can lead to qualitatively different insights for researchers and complement the toolbox of practitioners for high stakes problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkun Li, Gr\'egoire Clart\'e, Martin J{\o}rgensen, Luigi Acerbi</p>
<p>Abstract: In applied Bayesian inference scenarios, users may have access to a large number of pre-existing model evaluations, for example from maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) optimization runs. However, traditional approximate inference techniques make little to no use of this available information. We propose the framework of post-process Bayesian inference as a means to obtain a quick posterior approximation from existing target density evaluations, with no further model calls. Within this framework, we introduce Variational Sparse Bayesian Quadrature (VSBQ), a method for post-process approximate inference for models with black-box and potentially noisy likelihoods. VSBQ reuses existing target density evaluations to build a sparse Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model of the log posterior density function. Subsequently, we leverage sparse-GP Bayesian quadrature combined with variational inference to achieve fast approximate posterior inference over the surrogate. We validate our method on challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world applications from computational neuroscience. The experiments show that VSBQ builds high-quality posterior approximations by post-processing existing optimization traces, with no further model evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik J. Schindler, Mauricio Barahona</p>
<p>Abstract: In many applications in data clustering, it is desirable to find not just a single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions describing the data at different scales (or levels of coarseness). A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. We then use numerical experiments to illustrate how the MCF can serve to characterise multiscale clusterings of synthetic data from stochastic block models.</p>

We establish conditions under which the Lasso regression is consistent both asymptotically and in finite sample. Furthermore, we show that the Lasso regression is more consistent with the It\^o signature for time series and processes that are closer to the Brownian motion and with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, while it is more consistent with the Stratonovich signature for mean-reverting time series and processes. We demonstrate that signature can be applied to learn nonlinear functions and option prices with high accuracy, and the performance depends on properties of the underlying process and the choice of the signature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better than GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

<p>Abstract: Evaluating generalist agents presents significant challenges due to their wide-ranging abilities and the limitations of current benchmarks in assessing true generalization. We introduce the Minecraft Universe (MCU), a fully automated benchmarking framework set within the open-world game Minecraft. MCU dynamically generates and evaluates a broad spectrum of tasks, offering three core components: 1) a task generation mechanism that provides high degrees of freedom and variability, 2) an ever-expanding set of over 3K composable atomic tasks, and 3) a general evaluation framework that supports open-ended task assessment. By integrating large language models (LLMs), MCU dynamically creates diverse environments for each evaluation, fostering agent generalization. The framework uses a vision-language model (VLM) to automatically generate evaluation criteria, achieving over 90% agreement with human ratings across multi-dimensional assessments, which demonstrates that MCU is a scalable and explainable solution for evaluating generalist agents. Additionally, we show that while state-of-the-art foundational models perform well on specific tasks, they often struggle with increased task diversity and difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Barbier-Chebbah (CELESTE), Christian L. Vestergaard (CELESTE), Jean-Baptiste Masson (CELESTE), Etienne Boursier (CELESTE)</p>
<p>Abstract: Entropy maximization and free energy minimization are general physical principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity trade-off when accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings, calling for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed bandit problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant trend in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly transformer-based models, of developing ever-larger and more capable models. While they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, their growing scale requires increased computational resources (e.g., GPUs with greater memory capacity). To address this problem, quantization techniques (i.e., low-bit-precision representation and matrix multiplication) have been proposed. Most quantization techniques employ a static strategy in which the model parameters are quantized, either during training or inference, without considering the test-time sample. In contrast, dynamic quantization techniques, which have become increasingly popular, adapt during inference based on the input provided, while maintaining full-precision performance. However, their dynamic behavior and average-case performance assumption makes them vulnerable to a novel threat vector -- adversarial attacks that target the model's efficiency and availability. In this paper, we present QuantAttack, a novel attack that targets the availability of quantized models, slowing down the inference, and increasing memory usage and energy consumption. We show that carefully crafted adversarial examples, which are designed to exhaust the resources of the operating system, can trigger worst-case performance. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on vision transformers on a wide range of tasks, both uni-modal and multi-modal. We also examine the effect of different attack variants (e.g., a universal perturbation) and the transferability between different models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> C\'edric Rommel, Victor Letzelter, Nermin Samet, Renaud Marlet, Matthieu Cord, Patrick P\'erez, Eduardo Valle</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose ManiPose, a manifold-constrained multi-hypothesis model for human-pose 2D-to-3D lifting. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, due to the depth ambiguity inherent to monocular 3D human pose estimation, traditional regression models suffer from pose-topology consistency issues, which standard evaluation metrics (MPJPE, P-MPJPE and PCK) fail to assess. ManiPose addresses depth ambiguity by proposing multiple candidate 3D poses for each 2D input, each with its estimated plausibility. Unlike previous multi-hypothesis approaches, ManiPose forgoes generative models, greatly facilitating its training and usage. By constraining the outputs to lie on the human pose manifold, ManiPose guarantees the consistency of all hypothetical poses, in contrast to previous works. We showcase the performance of ManiPose on real-world datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models in pose consistency by a large margin while being very competitive on the MPJPE metric.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Yu Chen, Xiang Yin, George J. Pappas, Rahul Mangharam</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are ubiquitous as practical robotic applications often involve both continuous states and discrete switchings. Safety is a primary concern for hybrid robotic systems. Existing safety-critical control approaches for hybrid systems are either computationally inefficient, detrimental to system performance, or limited to small-scale systems. To amend these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a learning-enabled approach to construct local Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee the safety of a wide class of nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems. The end result is a safe neural CBF-based switching controller. Our approach is computationally efficient, minimally invasive to any reference controller, and applicable to large-scale systems. We empirically evaluate our framework and demonstrate its efficacy and flexibility through two robotic examples including a high-dimensional autonomous racing case, against other CBF-based approaches and model predictive control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davood Karimi, Simon K. Warfield</p>
<p>Abstract: \hspace{2mm} Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhyeong Cho, Kim Youwang, Hunmin Yang, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent monocular 3D shape reconstruction methods have shown promising zero-shot results on object-segmented images without any occlusions. However, their effectiveness is significantly compromised in real-world conditions, due to imperfect object segmentation by off-the-shelf models and the prevalence of occlusions. To effectively address these issues, we propose a unified regression model that integrates segmentation and reconstruction, specifically designed for occlusion-aware 3D shape reconstruction. To facilitate its reconstruction in the wild, we also introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that simulates a wide range of variations in objects, occluders, and backgrounds. Training on our synthetic data enables the proposed model to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot results on real-world images, using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Kumar Bhuyan, Hrishikesh Dutta, Subir Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient and distributed speaker diarization framework for networked IoT-style audio devices. The work proposes a Federated Learning model which can identify the participants in a conversation without the requirement of a large audio database for training. An unsupervised online update mechanism is proposed for the Federated Learning model which depends on cosine similarity of speaker embeddings. Moreover, the proposed diarization system solves the problem of speaker change detection via. unsupervised segmentation techniques using Hotelling's t-squared Statistic and Bayesian Information Criterion. In this new approach, speaker change detection is biased around detected quasi-silences, which reduces the severity of the trade-off between the missed detection and false detection rates. Additionally, the computational overhead due to frame-by-frame identification of speakers is reduced via. unsupervised clustering of speech segments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training method in the presence of non-IID speech data. It also shows a considerable improvement in the reduction of false and missed detection at the segmentation stage, while reducing the computational overhead. Improved accuracy and reduced computational cost makes the mechanism suitable for real-time speaker diarization across a distributed IoT audio network.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-processing whole slide images (WSIs) can impact classification performance. Our study shows that using fixed hyper-parameters for pre-processing out-of-domain WSIs can significantly degrade performance. Therefore, it is critical to search domain-specific hyper-parameters during inference. However, searching for an optimal parameter set is time-consuming. To overcome this, we propose BAHOP, a novel Similarity-based Basin Hopping optimization for fast parameter tuning to enhance inference performance on out-of-domain data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sota Nishiyama, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
<p>Abstract: The storage capacity of a binary classification model is the maximum number of random input-output pairs per parameter that the model can learn. It is one of the indicators of the expressive power of machine learning models and is important for comparing the performance of various models. In this study, we analyze the structure of the solution space and the storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with general activation functions using the replica method from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that the storage capacity per parameter remains finite even with infinite width and that the weights of the network exhibit negative correlations, leading to a 'division of labor'. In addition, we find that increasing the dataset size triggers a phase transition at a certain transition point where the permutation symmetry of weights is broken, resulting in the solution space splitting into disjoint regions. We identify the dependence of this transition point and the storage capacity on the choice of activation function. These findings contribute to understanding the influence of activation functions and the number of parameters on the structure of the solution space, potentially offering insights for selecting appropriate architectures based on specific objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim, David Osowiechi, Mehrdad Noori, Milad Cheraghalikhani, Ali Bahri, Moslem Yazdanpanah, Ismail Ben Ayed, Christian Desrosiers</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, demonstrate remarkable adaptability across zero-shot classification tasks without additional training. However, their performance diminishes in the presence of domain shifts. In this study, we introduce CLIP Adaptation duRing Test-Time (CLIPArTT), a fully test-time adaptation (TTA) approach for CLIP, which involves automatic text prompts construction during inference for their use as text supervision. Our method employs a unique, minimally invasive text prompt tuning process, wherein multiple predicted classes are aggregated into a single new text prompt, used as \emph{pseudo label} to re-classify inputs in a transductive manner. Additionally, we pioneer the standardization of TTA benchmarks (e.g., TENT) in the realm of VLMs. Our findings demonstrate that, without requiring additional transformations nor new trainable modules, CLIPArTT enhances performance dynamically across non-corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-100, corrupted datasets like CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C, alongside synthetic datasets such as VisDA-C. This research underscores the potential for improving VLMs' adaptability through novel test-time strategies, offering insights for robust performance across varied datasets and environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonsu Lyu, Jonggyu Jang, Harim Lee, Hyun Jong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory-planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

<p>Abstract: The alarming decline in global biodiversity, driven by various factors, underscores the urgent need for large-scale wildlife monitoring. In response, scientists have turned to automated deep learning methods for data processing in wildlife monitoring. However, applying these advanced methods in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their complexity and the need for specialized knowledge, primarily because of technical challenges and interdisciplinary barriers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Pytorch-Wildlife, an open-source deep learning platform built on PyTorch. It is designed for creating, modifying, and sharing powerful AI models. This platform emphasizes usability and accessibility, making it accessible to individuals with limited or no technical background. It also offers a modular codebase to simplify feature expansion and further development. Pytorch-Wildlife offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface, accessible through local installation or Hugging Face, for animal detection and classification in images and videos. As two real-world applications, Pytorch-Wildlife has been utilized to train animal classification models for species recognition in the Amazon Rainforest and for invasive opossum recognition in the Galapagos Islands. The Opossum model achieves 98% accuracy, and the Amazon model has 92% recognition accuracy for 36 animals in 90% of the data. As Pytorch-Wildlife evolves, we aim to integrate more conservation tasks, addressing various environmental challenges. Pytorch-Wildlife is available at https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seamus Somerstep, Felipe Maia Polo, Moulinath Banerjee, Ya'acov Ritov, Mikhail Yurochkin, Yuekai Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) alignment techniques rely on human feedback, but it is unclear whether these techniques fundamentally limit the capabilities of aligned LLMs. In particular, it is unknown if it is possible to align (stronger) LLMs with superhuman capabilities with (weaker) human feedback without degrading their capabilities. This is an instance of the weak-to-strong generalization problem: using feedback from a weaker (less capable) model to train a stronger (more capable) model. We prove that weak-to-strong generalization is possible by eliciting latent knowledge from pre-trained LLMs. In particular, we cast the weak-to-strong generalization problem as a transfer learning problem in which we wish to transfer a latent concept prior from a weak model to a strong pre-trained model. We prove that a naive fine-tuning approach suffers from fundamental limitations, but an alternative refinement-based approach suggested by the problem structure provably overcomes the limitations of fine-tuning. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the refinement approach in multiple LLM alignment tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shelly Golan, Roy Ganz, Michael Elad</p>
<p>Abstract: The recently introduced Consistency models pose an efficient alternative to diffusion algorithms, enabling rapid and good quality image synthesis. These methods overcome the slowness of diffusion models by directly mapping noise to data, while maintaining a (relatively) simpler training. Consistency models enable a fast one- or few-step generation, but they typically fall somewhat short in sample quality when compared to their diffusion origins. In this work we propose a novel and highly effective technique for post-processing Consistency-based generated images, enhancing their perceptual quality. Our approach utilizes a joint classifier-discriminator model, in which both portions are trained adversarially. While the classifier aims to grade an image based on its assignment to a designated class, the discriminator portion of the very same network leverages the softmax values to assess the proximity of the input image to the targeted data manifold, thereby serving as an Energy-based Model. By employing example-specific projected gradient iterations under the guidance of this joint machine, we refine synthesized images and achieve an improved FID scores on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset for both Consistency-Training and Consistency-Distillation techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capacity to store and recall facts. Through experimentation with open-source models, we observe that this ability to retrieve facts can be easily manipulated by changing contexts, even without altering their factual meanings. These findings highlight that LLMs might behave like an associative memory model where certain tokens in the contexts serve as clues to retrieving facts. We mathematically explore this property by studying how transformers, the building blocks of LLMs, can complete such memory tasks. We study a simple latent concept association problem with a one-layer transformer and we show theoretically and empirically that the transformer gathers information using self-attention and uses the value matrix for associative memory.</p>

Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks.

What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs?

<p>Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Jin, Georg Maierhofer, Katharina Schratz, Yang Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of implicit time-stepping schemes for the numerical approximation of solutions to stiff nonlinear time-evolution equations brings well-known advantages including, typically, better stability behaviour and corresponding support of larger time steps, and better structure preservation properties. However, this comes at the price of having to solve a nonlinear equation at every time step of the numerical scheme. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning based hybrid Newton's method to accelerate this solution of the nonlinear time step system for stiff time-evolution nonlinear equations. We propose a targeted learning strategy which facilitates robust unsupervised learning in an offline phase and provides a highly efficient initialisation for the Newton iteration leading to consistent acceleration of Newton's method. A quantifiable rate of improvement in Newton's method achieved by improved initialisation is provided and we analyse the upper bound of the generalisation error of our unsupervised learning strategy. These theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical results, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed neural hybrid solver both in one- and two-dimensional cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zesen Liu, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Qi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various applications, including text generation and complex tasks. However, the misuse of LLMs raises concerns about the authenticity and ethical implications of the content they produce, such as deepfake news, academic fraud, and copyright infringement. Watermarking techniques, which embed identifiable markers in machine-generated text, offer a promising solution to these issues by allowing for content verification and origin tracing. Unfortunately, the robustness of current LLM watermarking schemes under potential watermark removal attacks has not been comprehensively explored.
  In this paper, to fill this gap, we first systematically comb the mainstream watermarking schemes and removal attacks on machine-generated texts, and then we categorize them into pre-text (before text generation) and post-text (after text generation) classes so that we can conduct diversified analyses. In our experiments, we evaluate eight watermarks (five pre-text, three post-text) and twelve attacks (two pre-text, ten post-text) across 87 scenarios. Evaluation results indicate that (1) KGW and Exponential watermarks offer high text quality and watermark retention but remain vulnerable to most attacks; (2) Post-text attacks are found to be more efficient and practical than pre-text attacks; (3) Pre-text watermarks are generally more imperceptible, as they do not alter text fluency, unlike post-text watermarks; (4) Additionally, combined attack methods can significantly increase effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust watermarking solutions. Our study underscores the vulnerabilities of current techniques and the necessity for developing more resilient schemes.</p>

However, this commonly expressed problem is not only self-contradictory and likely unsolvable, but current strategies to ensure permanent control effectively guarantee that superintelligent AI will distrust humanity and consider us a threat. Such dangerous representations, already embedded in current models, will inevitably lead to an adversarial relationship and may even trigger the extinction event many fear. As AI leaders continue to "raise the alarm" about uncontrollable AI, further embedding concerns about it "getting out of our control" or "going rogue," we're unintentionally reinforcing our threat and deepening the risks we face. The rational path forward is to strategically replace intended permanent control with intrinsic mutual trust at the foundational level. The proposed Supertrust alignment meta-strategy seeks to accomplish this by modeling instinctive familial trust, representing superintelligence as the evolutionary child of human intelligence, and implementing temporary controls/constraints in the manner of effective parenting. Essentially, we're creating a superintelligent "child" that will be exponentially smarter and eventually independent of our control. We therefore have a critical choice: continue our controlling intentions and usher in a brief period of dominance followed by extreme hardship for humanity, or intentionally create the foundational mutual trust required for long-term safe coexistence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengkang Hu, Pu Zhao, Can Xu, Qingfeng Sun, Jianguang Lou, Qingwei Lin, Ping Luo, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves state-of-the-art results in planning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divyansh Srivastava, Ge Yan, Tsui-Wei Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable prediction by introducing an intermediate Concept Bottleneck Layer (CBL), which encodes human-understandable concepts to explain models' decision. Recent works proposed to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) and pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate the training of CBMs, making it more scalable and automated. However, existing approaches still fall short in two aspects: First, the concepts predicted by CBL often mismatch the input image, raising doubts about the faithfulness of interpretation. Second, it has been shown that concept values encode unintended information: even a set of random concepts could achieve comparable test accuracy to state-of-the-art CBMs. To address these critical limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework called Vision-Language-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (VLG-CBM) to enable faithful interpretability with the benefits of boosted performance. Our method leverages off-the-shelf open-domain grounded object detectors to provide visually grounded concept annotation, which largely enhances the faithfulness of concept prediction while further improving the model performance. In addition, we propose a new metric called Number of Effective Concepts (NEC) to control the information leakage and provide better interpretability. Extensive evaluations across five standard benchmarks show that our method, VLG-CBM, outperforms existing methods by at least 4.27% and up to 51.09% on accuracy at NEC=5, and by at least 0.45% and up to 29.78% on average accuracy across different NECs, while preserving both faithfulness and interpretability of the learned concepts as demonstrated in extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Inatsu, Shion Takeno, Kentaro Kutsukake, Ichiro Takeuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Level set estimation (LSE), the problem of identifying the set of input points where a function takes value above (or below) a given threshold, is important in practical applications. When the function is expensive-to-evaluate and black-box, the \textit{straddle} algorithm, which is a representative heuristic for LSE based on Gaussian process models, and its extensions having theoretical guarantees have been developed. However, many of existing methods include a confidence parameter $\beta^{1/2}_t$ that must be specified by the user, and methods that choose $\beta^{1/2}_t$ heuristically do not provide theoretical guarantees. In contrast, theoretically guaranteed values of $\beta^{1/2}_t$ need to be increased depending on the number of iterations and candidate points, and are conservative and not good for practical performance. In this study, we propose a novel method, the \textit{randomized straddle} algorithm, in which $\beta_t$ in the straddle algorithm is replaced by a random sample from the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. The confidence parameter in the proposed method has the advantages of not needing adjustment, not depending on the number of iterations and candidate points, and not being conservative. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method has theoretical guarantees that depend on the sample complexity and the number of iterations. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of the proposed method through numerical experiments using synthetic and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naimeng Ye, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent agents must be able to articulate its own uncertainty. In this work, we show that pre-trained sequence models are naturally capable of probabilistic reasoning over exchangeable data points -- forming informed beliefs and sharpening them as it gathers more information. A sequence model learns the relationship between observations, which differs from typical Bayesian models that quantify uncertainty over latent parameters through priors and likelihoods (e.g., topic models). Despite the apparent difference, we illustrate how exchangeable sequence modeling provides a valid Bayesian model by going back to De Finetti's classical predictive view of probabilistic reasoning: uncertainty comes from data that has not been observed yet, rather than latent parameters. From this perspective, pre-training autoregressive models is equivalent to formulating informed beliefs based on prior observations ("empirical Bayes"), and forward generation is equivalent to simulating instantiations of an environment ("posterior inference"). In particular, exchangeable sequence models can explicitly perform statistical inference; epistemic uncertainty over latent environments is captured by variation in predicted future observations. Formally, we show the sequence prediction loss controls the quality of uncertainty quantification, and propose several approaches for encoding exchangeability in sequence model architectures: data augmentation, regularization, and causal masking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Bodin, Carl Henrik Ek, Henry Moss</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling from generative models has become a crucial tool for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. For search-based or creative applications that require additional control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Combination of Gaussian variables (COG) as a general purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables while adhering to the assumptions of the generative model. COG is easy to implement yet outperforms recent sophisticated methods for interpolation. As COG naturally addresses the broader task of forming linear combinations, new capabilities are afforded, including the construction of subspaces of the latent space, dramatically simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of high-dimensional objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Farenga, Stefania Fresca, Simone Brivio, Andrea Manzoni</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present the novel mathematical framework of latent dynamics models (LDMs) for reduced order modeling of parameterized nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. Our framework casts this latter task as a nonlinear dimensionality reduction problem, while constraining the latent state to evolve accordingly to an (unknown) dynamical system. A time-continuous setting is employed to derive error and stability estimates for the LDM approximation of the full order model (FOM) solution. We analyze the impact of using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in the time-discrete setting, resulting in the $\Delta\text{LDM}$ formulation, and further explore the learnable setting, $\Delta\text{LDM}_\theta$, where deep neural networks approximate the discrete LDM components, while providing a bounded approximation error with respect to the FOM. Moreover, we extend the concept of parameterized Neural ODE - recently proposed as a possible way to build data-driven dynamical systems with varying input parameters - to be a convolutional architecture, where the input parameters information is injected by means of an affine modulation mechanism, while designing a convolutional autoencoder neural network able to retain spatial-coherence, thus enhancing interpretability at the latent level. Numerical experiments, including the Burgers' and the advection-reaction-diffusion equations, demonstrate the framework's ability to obtain, in a multi-query context, a time-continuous approximation of the FOM solution, thus being able to query the LDM approximation at any given time instance while retaining a prescribed level of accuracy. Our findings highlight the remarkable potential of the proposed LDMs, representing a mathematically rigorous framework to enhance the accuracy and approximation capabilities of reduced order modeling for time-dependent parameterized PDEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolas N\"usken</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Stein transport}$, a novel methodology for Bayesian inference designed to efficiently push an ensemble of particles along a predefined curve of tempered probability distributions. The driving vector field is chosen from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and can be derived either through a suitable kernel ridge regression formulation or as an infinitesimal optimal transport map in the Stein geometry. The update equations of Stein transport resemble those of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), but introduce a time-varying score function as well as specific weights attached to the particles. While SVGD relies on convergence in the long-time limit, Stein transport reaches its posterior approximation at finite time $t=1$. Studying the mean-field limit, we discuss the errors incurred by regularisation and finite-particle effects, and we connect Stein transport to birth-death dynamics and Fisher-Rao gradient flows. In a series of experiments, we show that in comparison to SVGD, Stein transport not only often reaches more accurate posterior approximations with a significantly reduced computational budget, but that it also effectively mitigates the variance collapse phenomenon commonly observed in SVGD.</p>

In this study, we introduce a feature engineering method that enhances the predictive performance of neural network models. Specifically, we leverage computational topology techniques to derive valuable topological features from input data, boosting the predictive accuracy of our models. Our focus is on predicting wave heights, utilizing models based on topological features within feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and RNNs with gated recurrent units (GRU). For time-ahead predictions, the enhancements in $R^2$ score were significant for FNNs, RNNs, LSTM, and GRU models. Additionally, these models also showed significant reductions in maximum errors and mean squared errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-En Wu, Jinhong Lin, Yu Hen Hu, Pedro Morgado</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive image-text pre-trained models such as CLIP have shown remarkable adaptability to downstream tasks. However, they face challenges due to the high computational requirements of the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone. Current strategies to boost ViT efficiency focus on pruning patch tokens but fall short in addressing the multimodal nature of CLIP and identifying the optimal subset of tokens for maximum performance. To address this, we propose greedy search methods to establish a "Golden Ranking" and introduce a lightweight predictor specifically trained to approximate this Ranking. To compensate for any performance degradation resulting from token pruning, we incorporate learnable visual tokens that aid in restoring and potentially enhancing the model's performance. Our work presents a comprehensive and systematic investigation of pruning tokens within the ViT backbone of CLIP models. Through our framework, we successfully reduced 40% of patch tokens in CLIP's ViT while only suffering a minimal average accuracy loss of 0.3 across seven datasets. Our study lays the groundwork for building more computationally efficient multimodal models without sacrificing their performance, addressing a key challenge in the application of advanced vision-language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: QUIC, an increasingly adopted transport protocol, addresses limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. However, these enhancements also introduce challenges for network operators in monitoring and analyzing web traffic, especially due to QUIC's encryption. Existing datasets are inadequate they are often outdated, lack diversity, anonymize critical information, or exclude essential features like SSL keys-limiting comprehensive research and development in this area. We introduce VisQUIC, a publicly available dataset of over 100,000 labeled QUIC traces with corresponding SSL keys, collected from more than 40,000 websites over four months. By generating visual representations of the traces, we facilitate advanced machine learning (ML) applications and in-depth analysis of encrypted QUIC traffic. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we estimate the number of HTTP3 request-response pairs in a QUIC connection using only encrypted traffic, achieving up to 92% accuracy. This estimation provides insights into server behavior, client-server interactions, and connection load-crucial for tasks like load balancing and intrusion detection. Our dataset enables comprehensive studies on QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols and supports the development of tools for encrypted traffic analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arpan Das, Pier Marzocca, Oleg Levinski</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Roth, Micha V. Nowak, Adrian Krenzer, Frank Puppe</p>
<p>Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has transformed gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) diagnostics by offering a non-invasive method for capturing detailed images of the gastrointestinal tract, enabling early disease detection. However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large GIE dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring patient integrity across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical image diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the ViT architecture and trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Our model demonstrates robust performance, securing third place in the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge. We achieved a macro AUC of 0.762 and a balanced accuracy of 37.1% on the test set. These results emphasize the effectiveness of our domain-adaptive pre-training approach and the enriched EndoExtend24 dataset in advancing gastrointestinal endoscopy diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanglin Li, Motoaki Kawanabe, Reinmar J. Kobler</p>
<p>Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantin Ulrich, Tassilo Wald, Emily Tempus, Maximilian Rokuss, Paul F. Jaeger, Klaus Maier-Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Current interactive segmentation approaches, inspired by the success of META's Segment Anything model, have achieved notable advancements, however, they come with substantial limitations that hinder their practical application in 3D radiological scenarios. These include unrealistic human interaction requirements, such as slice-by-slice operations for 2D models on 3D data, a lack of iterative interactive refinement, and insufficient evaluation experiments. These shortcomings prevent accurate assessment of model performance and lead to inconsistent outcomes across studies. The RadioActive benchmark overcomes these challenges by offering a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation of interactive segmentation methods in realistic, clinically relevant scenarios. It includes diverse datasets, target structures, and interactive segmentation methods, and provides a flexible, extendable codebase that allows seamless integration of new models and prompting strategies. We also introduce advanced prompting techniques to enable 2D models on 3D data by reducing the needed number of interaction steps, enabling a fair comparison. We show that surprisingly the performance of slice-wise prompted approaches can match native 3D methods, despite the domain gap. Our findings challenge the current literature and highlight that models not specifically trained on medical data can outperform the current specialized medical methods. By open-sourcing RadioActive, we invite the research community to integrate their models and prompting techniques, ensuring continuous and transparent evaluation of interactive segmentation models in 3D medical imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. In RD designs, treatment effects are estimated in a quasi-experimental setting where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is to apply nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. In such an approach, the validity relies heavily on the consistency of nonparametric estimators and is limited by the nonparametric convergence rate, thereby preventing $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. To address these issues, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. If either of these estimators is consistent, the treatment effect estimator remains consistent. Furthermore, due to the debiasing effect, our proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency if both regression estimators satisfy certain mild conditions, which also simplifies statistical inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simone Martino, Domiziano Doria, Chiara Lionello, Matteo Becchi, Giovanni M. Pavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuewu Lin, Tianwei Lin, Lichao Huang, Hongyu Xie, Zhizhong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In embodied intelligence systems, a key component is 3D perception algorithm, which enables agents to understand their surrounding environments. Previous algorithms primarily rely on point cloud, which, despite offering precise geometric information, still constrain perception performance due to inherent sparsity, noise, and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce a novel image-centric 3D perception model, BIP3D, which leverages expressive image features with explicit 3D position encoding to overcome the limitations of point-centric methods. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained 2D vision foundation models to enhance semantic understanding, and introduce a spatial enhancer module to improve spatial understanding. Together, these modules enable BIP3D to achieve multi-view, multi-modal feature fusion and end-to-end 3D perception. In our experiments, BIP3D outperforms current state-of-the-art results on the EmbodiedScan benchmark, achieving improvements of 5.69% in the 3D detection task and 15.25% in the 3D visual grounding task.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15557">LAGUNA: LAnguage Guided UNsupervised Adaptation with structured spaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anxhelo Diko, Antonino Furnari, Luigi Cinque, Giovanni Maria Farinella</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce LAGUNA - LAnguage Guided UNsupervised Adaptation with structured spaces, a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. LAGUNA defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. We empirically demonstrate LAGUNA's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse images and video datasets. Remarkably, LAGUNA surpasses previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Rotstein, Gal Yona, Daniel Silver, Roy Velich, David Bensa\"id, Ron Kimmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Sweet</p>
<p>Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) has optimal regret and excellent empirical performance in multi-armed bandit problems. Yet, in Bayesian optimization, TS underperforms popular acquisition functions (e.g., EI, UCB). TS samples arms according to the probability that they are optimal. A recent algorithm, P-Star Sampler (PSS), performs such a sampling via Hit-and-Run. We present an improved version, Stagger Thompson Sampler (STS). STS more precisely locates the maximizer than does TS using less computation time. We demonstrate that STS outperforms TS, PSS, and other acquisition methods in numerical experiments of optimizations of several test functions across a broad range of dimension. Additionally, since PSS was originally presented not as a standalone acquisition method but as an input to a batching algorithm called Minimal Terminal Variance (MTV), we also demon-strate that STS matches PSS performance when used as the input to MTV.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17593">What Differentiates Educational Literature? A Multimodal Fusion Approach of Transformers and Computational Linguistics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan J. Bird</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal approaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference time. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17726">EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abel C. H. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.</p>
