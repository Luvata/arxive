<p><b>Authors:</b> Nigel G. Ward, Andres Segura, Georgina Bugarini, Heike Lehnert-LeHouillier, Dancheng Liu, Jinjun Xiong, Olac Fuentes</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagnosis and treatment of individuals with communication disorders offers many opportunities for the application of speech technology, but research so far has not adequately considered: the diversity of conditions, the role of pragmatic deficits, and the challenges of limited data. This paper explores how a general-purpose model of perceived pragmatic similarity may overcome these limitations. It explains how it might support several use cases for clinicians and clients, and presents evidence that a simple model can provide value, and in particular can capture utterance aspects that are relevant to diagnoses of autism and specific language impairment.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for medical question answering, there is limited work focused on tropical and infectious disease-specific exploration. We build on an opensource tropical and infectious diseases (TRINDs) dataset, expanding it to include demographic and semantic clinical and consumer augmentations yielding 11000+ prompts. We evaluate LLM performance on these, comparing generalist and medical LLMs, as well as LLM outcomes to human experts. We demonstrate through systematic experimentation, the benefit of contextual information such as demographics, location, gender, risk factors for optimal LLM response. Finally we develop a prototype of TRINDs-LM, a research tool that provides a playground to navigate how context impacts LLM outputs for health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Zhang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture excels in a variety of language modeling tasks, outperforming traditional neural architectures such as RNN and LSTM. This is partially due to its elimination of recurrent connections, which allows for parallel training and a smoother flow of gradients. However, this move away from recurrent structures places the Transformer model at the lower end of Chomsky's computational hierarchy, imposing limitations on its computational abilities. Consequently, even advanced Transformer-based models face considerable difficulties in tasks like counting, string reversal, bracket pairing, and multiplication. These tasks, though seemingly elementary, require a level of computational complexity that exceeds the capabilities of the Transformer architecture. Concurrently, the emergence of ``Chain of Thought" (CoT) prompting has enabled Transformer-based language models to tackle tasks that were previously impossible or poorly executed. Despite some previous research primarily interpreting CoT from a psychological perspective, a comprehensive understanding of \textit{why} CoT proves so effective in the reasoning process remains elusive. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the influence of recurrent structures in language models on their reasoning abilities, shedding light on how the CoT approach can mimic recurrent computation and act as a bridge between autoregression and recurrence. It is this approximated recurrence that notably improves the model's performance and computational capacity. Moreover, we revisit recent recurrent-based Transformer model designs, focusing on their computational abilities through our proposed concept of ``recurrence-completeness" and identify key theoretical limitations in models like Linear Transformer and RWKV. Through this, we aim to provide insight into the neural model architectures and prompt better model design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Ai, Ziwei Gong, Harshsaiprasad Deshpande, Alexander Johnson, Emmy Phung, Ahmad Emami, Julia Hirschberg</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of online content has intensified the issue of information redundancy, underscoring the need for solutions that can identify genuinely new information. Despite this challenge, the research community has seen a decline in focus on novelty detection, particularly with the rise of large language models (LLMs). Additionally, previous approaches have relied heavily on human annotation, which is time-consuming, costly, and particularly challenging when annotators must compare a target document against a vast number of historical documents. In this work, we introduce NovAScore (Novelty Evaluation in Atomicity Score), an automated metric for evaluating document-level novelty. NovAScore aggregates the novelty and salience scores of atomic information, providing high interpretability and a detailed analysis of a document's novelty. With its dynamic weight adjustment scheme, NovAScore offers enhanced flexibility and an additional dimension to assess both the novelty level and the importance of information within a document. Our experiments show that NovAScore strongly correlates with human judgments of novelty, achieving a 0.626 Point-Biserial correlation on the TAP-DLND 1.0 dataset and a 0.920 Pearson correlation on an internal human-annotated dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taisei Kat\^o, Yusuke Miyao</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine the abilities of intrinsic bias metrics of static word embeddings to predict whether Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems exhibit biased behavior. A word embedding is one of the fundamental NLP technologies that represents the meanings of words through real vectors, and problematically, it also learns social biases such as stereotypes. An intrinsic bias metric measures bias by examining a characteristic of vectors, while an extrinsic bias metric checks whether an NLP system trained with a word embedding is biased. A previous study found that a common intrinsic bias metric usually does not correlate with extrinsic bias metrics. However, the intrinsic and extrinsic bias metrics did not measure the same bias in most cases, which makes us question whether the lack of correlation is genuine. In this paper, we extract characteristic words from datasets of extrinsic bias metrics and analyze correlations with intrinsic bias metrics with those words to ensure both metrics measure the same bias. We observed moderate to high correlations with some extrinsic bias metrics but little to no correlations with the others. This result suggests that intrinsic bias metrics can predict biased behavior in particular settings but not in others. Experiment codes are available at GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Hsien Wu, Chao-Lin Liu, Wei-Jie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a hybrid mechanism for recommending similar cases of labor and employment litigations. The classifier determines the similarity based on the itemized disputes of the two cases, that the courts prepared. We cluster the disputes, compute the cosine similarity between the disputes, and use the results as the features for the classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that this hybrid approach outperformed our previous system, which considered only the information about the clusters of the disputes. We replaced the disputes that were prepared by the courts with the itemized disputes that were generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and repeated the same experiments. Using the disputes generated by GPT-4 led to better results. Although our classifier did not perform as well when using the disputes that the ChatGPT generated, the results were satisfactory. Hence, we hope that the future large-language models will become practically useful.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09281">Language Models &quot;Grok&quot; to Copy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Lv, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahan Tu, Rui Hu, Jitao Sang</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating hallucinations are static, which can lead to potential data contamination. This paper introduces ODE, an open-set, dynamic protocol for evaluating object existence hallucinations in MLLMs. Our framework employs graph structures to model associations between real-word concepts and generates novel samples for both general and domain-specific scenarios. The dynamic combination of concepts, along with various combination principles, ensures a broad sample distribution. Experimental results show that MLLMs exhibit higher hallucination rates with ODE-generated samples, effectively avoiding data contamination. Moreover, these samples can also be used for fine-tuning to improve MLLM performance on existing benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanlong Liu, Enqi Zhang, Li Zhou, Dingyi Zeng, Shaohuan Cheng, Chen Zhang, Malu Zhang, Wenyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation in the Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. However, existing retrieval-based EAE methods have two main limitations: (1) input length constraints and (2) the gap between the retriever and the inference model. These issues limit the diversity and quality of the retrieved information. In this paper, we propose a Compressive Memory-based Retrieval (CMR) mechanism for EAE, which addresses the two limitations mentioned above. Our compressive memory, designed as a dynamic matrix that effectively caches retrieved information and supports continuous updates, overcomes the limitations of the input length. Additionally, after pre-loading all candidate demonstrations into the compressive memory, the model further retrieves and filters relevant information from memory based on the input query, bridging the gap between the retriever and the inference model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets (RAMS, WikiEvents, ACE05), significantly outperforming existing retrieval-based EAE methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Yi Leong, Yi Fan Gao, Ji Shuai, Uktu Pamuksuz</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports. These findings suggest that MediGen has the potential to significantly reduce the administrative workload on physicians, improving both healthcare efficiency and physician well-being.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09362">Generating Event-oriented Attribution for Movies via Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced Multimodal LLM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanjie Lyu, Tong Xu, Zihan Niu, Bo Peng, Jing Ke, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The prosperity of social media platforms has raised the urgent demand for semantic-rich services, e.g., event and storyline attribution. However, most existing research focuses on clip-level event understanding, primarily through basic captioning tasks, without analyzing the causes of events across an entire movie. This is a significant challenge, as even advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with extensive multimodal information due to limited context length. To address this issue, we propose a Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced MLLM (TSPE) approach for event attribution, i.e., connecting associated events with their causal semantics, in movie videos. In the local stage, we introduce an interaction-aware prefix that guides the model to focus on the relevant multimodal information within a single clip, briefly summarizing the single event. Correspondingly, in the global stage, we strengthen the connections between associated events using an inferential knowledge graph, and design an event-aware prefix that directs the model to focus on associated events rather than all preceding clips, resulting in accurate event attribution. Comprehensive evaluations of two real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manjie Xu, Chenxing Li, Xinyi Tu, Yong Ren, Ruibo Fu, Wei Liang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09413">Constructive Approach to Bidirectional Causation between Qualia Structure and Language Emergence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tadahiro Taniguchi, Masafumi Oizumi, Noburo Saji, Takato Horii, Naotsugu Tsuchiya</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel perspective on the bidirectional causation between language emergence and relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out the constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that languages with distributional semantics, e.g., syntactic-semantic structures, may have emerged through the process of aligning internal representations among individuals, and such alignment of internal representations facilitates more structured language. This mutual dependency is suggested by the recent advancements in AI and symbol emergence robotics, and collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis, in particular. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional causation in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Lingo, Martin Arroyo, Rajeev Chhajer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet improving their problem-solving capabilities, particularly for complex, reasoning-intensive tasks, remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces the REAP (Reflection, Explicit Problem Deconstruction, and Advanced Prompting) method, an innovative approach within the dynamic context generation framework. REAP guides LLMs through reflection on the query, deconstructing it into manageable components, and generating relevant context to enhance the solution process. We evaluated REAP using a dataset designed to expose LLM limitations, comparing zero-shot prompting with REAP-enhanced prompts across six state-of-the-art models: OpenAI's o1-preview, o1-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The results demonstrate notable performance gains, with o1-mini improving by 40.97%, GPT-4o by 66.26%, and GPT-4o-mini by 112.93%. Despite the already strong baseline performance of OpenAI's o1-preview, modest gains were observed. Beyond performance improvements, REAP offers a cost-effective solution; for example, GPT-4o-mini, which is approximately 100 times cheaper than o1-preview, delivered competitive results. REAP also improves the clarity of model outputs, making it easier for humans to understand the reasoning behind the results and simplifying the process of identifying and addressing any issues. These findings demonstrate REAP's potential to greatly improve the capabilities of LLMs, providing both better performance and increased cost-efficiency across a wide range of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Pangakis, Samuel Wolken</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated text annotation is a compelling use case for generative large language models (LLMs) in social media research. Recent work suggests that LLMs can achieve strong performance on annotation tasks; however, these studies evaluate LLMs on a small number of tasks and likely suffer from contamination due to a reliance on public benchmark datasets. Here, we test a human-centered framework for responsibly evaluating artificial intelligence tools used in automated annotation. We use GPT-4 to replicate 27 annotation tasks across 11 password-protected datasets from recently published computational social science articles in high-impact journals. For each task, we compare GPT-4 annotations against human-annotated ground-truth labels and against annotations from separate supervised classification models fine-tuned on human-generated labels. Although the quality of LLM labels is generally high, we find significant variation in LLM performance across tasks, even within datasets. Our findings underscore the importance of a human-centered workflow and careful evaluation standards: Automated annotations significantly diverge from human judgment in numerous scenarios, despite various optimization strategies such as prompt tuning. Grounding automated annotation in validation labels generated by humans is essential for responsible evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Ren, Samuel Belkadi, Lifeng Han, Warren Del-Pinto, Goran Nenadic</p>
<p>Abstract: Since clinical letters contain sensitive information, clinical-related datasets can not be widely applied in model training, medical research, and teaching. This work aims to generate reliable, various, and de-identified synthetic clinical letters. To achieve this goal, we explored different pre-trained language models (PLMs) for masking and generating text. After that, we worked on Bio\_ClinicalBERT, a high-performing model, and experimented with different masking strategies. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used for evaluation. Additionally, a downstream task, Named Entity Recognition (NER), was also implemented to assess the usability of these synthetic letters.
  The results indicate that 1) encoder-only models outperform encoder-decoder models. 2) Among encoder-only models, those trained on general corpora perform comparably to those trained on clinical data when clinical information is preserved. 3) Additionally, preserving clinical entities and document structure better aligns with our objectives than simply fine-tuning the model. 4) Furthermore, different masking strategies can impact the quality of synthetic clinical letters. Masking stopwords has a positive impact, while masking nouns or verbs has a negative effect. 5) For evaluation, BERTScore should be the primary quantitative evaluation metric, with other metrics serving as supplementary references. 6) Contextual information does not significantly impact the models' understanding, so the synthetic clinical letters have the potential to replace the original ones in downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increasing popularity of daily information sharing and acquisition on the Internet, this paper introduces an innovative approach for intent classification in Bangla language, focusing on social media posts where individuals share their thoughts and opinions. The proposed method leverages multimodal data with particular emphasis on authorship identification, aiming to understand the underlying purpose behind textual content, especially in the context of varied user-generated posts on social media. Current methods often face challenges in low-resource languages like Bangla, particularly when author traits intricately link with intent, as observed in social media posts. To address this, we present the Multimodal-based Author Bangla Intent Classification (MABIC) framework, utilizing text and images to gain deeper insights into the conveyed intentions. We have created a dataset named "Uddessho," comprising 3,048 instances sourced from social media. Our methodology comprises two approaches for classifying textual intent and multimodal author intent, incorporating early fusion and late fusion techniques. In our experiments, the unimodal approach achieved an accuracy of 64.53% in interpreting Bangla textual intent. In contrast, our multimodal approach significantly outperformed traditional unimodal methods, achieving an accuracy of 76.19%. This represents an improvement of 11.66%. To our best knowledge, this is the first research work on multimodal-based author intent classification for low-resource Bangla language social media posts.</p>

There are two schools of thought on this topic: (1) generating personalized outputs by personalizing the input prompt through retrieval augmentation from the user's personal information (RAG-based methods), and (2) parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs per user that considers efficiency and space limitations (PEFT-based methods). This paper presents the first systematic comparison between two approaches on a wide range of personalization tasks using seven diverse datasets. Our results indicate that RAG-based and PEFT-based personalization methods on average yield 14.92% and 1.07% improvements over the non-personalized LLM, respectively. We find that combining RAG with PEFT elevates these improvements to 15.98%. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between the amount of user data and PEFT's effectiveness, indicating that RAG is a better choice for cold-start users (i.e., user's with limited personal data).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Mark Gales, Kate Knill</p>
<p>Abstract: Error correction (EC) models play a crucial role in refining Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcriptions, enhancing the readability and quality of transcriptions. Without requiring access to the underlying code or model weights, EC can improve performance and provide domain adaptation for black-box ASR systems. This work investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for error correction across diverse scenarios. 1-best ASR hypotheses are commonly used as the input to EC models. We propose building high-performance EC models using ASR N-best lists which should provide more contextual information for the correction process. Additionally, the generation process of a standard EC model is unrestricted in the sense that any output sequence can be generated. For some scenarios, such as unseen domains, this flexibility may impact performance. To address this, we introduce a constrained decoding approach based on the N-best list or an ASR lattice. Finally, most EC models are trained for a specific ASR system requiring retraining whenever the underlying ASR system is changed. This paper explores the ability of EC models to operate on the output of different ASR systems. This concept is further extended to zero-shot error correction using LLMs, such as ChatGPT. Experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods for both Transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder ASR systems. In addition, the proposed method can serve as an effective method for model ensembling.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09568">Thesis proposal: Are We Losing Textual Diversity to Natural Language Processing?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Josef Jon</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis argues that the currently widely used Natural Language Processing algorithms possibly have various limitations related to the properties of the texts they handle and produce. With the wide adoption of these tools in rapid progress, we must ask what these limitations are and what are the possible implications of integrating such tools even more deeply into our daily lives.
  As a testbed, we have chosen the task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Nevertheless, we aim for general insights and outcomes, applicable even to current Large Language Models (LLMs). We ask whether the algorithms used in NMT have inherent inductive biases that are beneficial for most types of inputs but might harm the processing of untypical texts. To explore this hypothesis, we define a set of measures to quantify text diversity based on its statistical properties, like uniformity or rhythmicity of word-level surprisal, on multiple scales (sentence, discourse, language). We then conduct a series of experiments to investigate whether NMT systems struggle with maintaining the diversity of such texts, potentially reducing the richness of the language generated by these systems, compared to human translators.
  We search for potential causes of these limitations rooted in training objectives and decoding algorithms. Our ultimate goal is to develop alternatives that do not enforce uniformity in the distribution of statistical properties in the output and that allow for better global planning of the translation, taking into account the intrinsic ambiguity of the translation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Thompson, Nitika Mathur, Daniel Deutsch, Huda Khayrallah</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting an automatic metric that best emulates human judgments is often non-trivial, because there is no clear definition of "best emulates." A meta-metric is required to compare the human judgments to the automatic metric judgments, and metric rankings depend on the choice of meta-metric. We propose Soft Pairwise Accuracy (SPA), a new meta-metric that builds on Pairwise Accuracy (PA) but incorporates the statistical significance of both the human judgments and the metric judgments. SPA allows for more fine-grained comparisons between systems than a simplistic binary win/loss, and addresses a number of shortcomings with PA: it is more stable with respect to both the number of systems and segments used for evaluation, it mitigates the issue of metric ties due to quantization, and it produces more statistically significant results. SPA was selected as the official system-level metric for the 2024 WMT metric shared task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yungi Kim, Hyunsoo Ha, Sukyung Lee, Jihoo Kim, Seonghoon Yang, Chanjun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing demand for substantial amounts of high-quality data to train large language models (LLMs), efficiently filtering large web corpora has become a critical challenge. For this purpose, KenLM, a lightweight n-gram-based language model that operates on CPUs, is widely used. However, the traditional method of training KenLM utilizes only high-quality data and, consequently, does not explicitly learn the linguistic patterns of low-quality data. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble approach that leverages two contrasting KenLMs: (i) Good KenLM, trained on high-quality data; and (ii) Bad KenLM, trained on low-quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces noisy content while preserving high-quality content compared to the traditional KenLM training method. This indicates that our method can be a practical solution with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The traditional data annotation process is often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to human bias, which complicates the management of increasingly complex datasets. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as automated data annotators to improve efficiency and consistency in annotation tasks. By employing rationale-driven collaborative few-shot prompting techniques, we aim to improve the performance of LLMs in text annotation. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of six LLMs across four benchmark datasets, comparing seven distinct methodologies. Our results demonstrate that collaborative methods consistently outperform traditional few-shot techniques and other baseline approaches, particularly in complex annotation tasks. Our work provides valuable insights and a robust framework for leveraging collaborative learning methods to tackle challenging text annotation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Jyun Sun, Suvodip Dey, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Gokhan Tur</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimation of a model's confidence on its outputs is critical for Conversational AI systems based on large language models (LLMs), especially for reducing hallucination and preventing over-reliance. In this work, we provide an exhaustive exploration of methods, including approaches proposed for open- and closed-weight LLMs, aimed at quantifying and leveraging model uncertainty to improve the reliability of LLM-generated responses, specifically focusing on dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS). Regardless of the model type, well-calibrated confidence scores are essential to handle uncertainties, thereby improving model performance. We evaluate four methods for estimating confidence scores based on softmax, raw token scores, verbalized confidences, and a combination of these methods, using the area under the curve (AUC) metric to assess calibration, with higher AUC indicating better calibration. We also enhance these with a self-probing mechanism, proposed for closed models. Furthermore, we assess these methods using an open-weight model fine-tuned for the task of DST, achieving superior joint goal accuracy (JGA). Our findings also suggest that fine-tuning open-weight LLMs can result in enhanced AUC performance, indicating better confidence score calibration.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AnnualBERT, a series of language models designed specifically to capture the temporal evolution of scientific text. Deviating from the prevailing paradigms of subword tokenizations and "one model to rule them all", AnnualBERT adopts whole words as tokens and is composed of a base RoBERTa model pretrained from scratch on the full-text of 1.7 million arXiv papers published until 2008 and a collection of progressively trained models on arXiv papers at an annual basis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AnnualBERT models by showing that they not only have comparable performances in standard tasks but also achieve state-of-the-art performances on domain-specific NLP tasks as well as link prediction tasks in the arXiv citation network. We then utilize probing tasks to quantify the models' behavior in terms of representation learning and forgetting as time progresses. Our approach enables the pretrained models to not only improve performances on scientific text processing tasks but also to provide insights into the development of scientific discourse over time.

<p>Abstract: Despite the recent advance in self-supervised representations, unsupervised phonetic segmentation remains challenging. Most approaches focus on improving phonetic representations with self-supervised learning, with the hope that the improvement can transfer to phonetic segmentation. In this paper, contrary to recent approaches, we show that peak detection on Mel spectrograms is a strong baseline, better than many self-supervised approaches. Based on this finding, we propose a simple hidden Markov model that uses self-supervised representations and features at the boundaries for phone segmentation. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements over previous approaches, with a generalized formulation allowing versatile design adaptations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanning Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates gender bias in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated teacher evaluations in higher education setting, focusing on evaluations produced by GPT-4 across six academic subjects. By applying a comprehensive analytical framework that includes Odds Ratio (OR) analysis, Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), sentiment analysis, and contextual analysis, this paper identified patterns of gender-associated language reflecting societal stereotypes. Specifically, words related to approachability and support were used more frequently for female instructors, while words related to entertainment were predominantly used for male instructors, aligning with the concepts of communal and agentic behaviors. The study also found moderate to strong associations between male salient adjectives and male names, though career and family words did not distinctly capture gender biases. These findings align with prior research on societal norms and stereotypes, reinforcing the notion that LLM-generated text reflects existing biases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yee Man Ng, Ilia Markov</p>
<p>Abstract: Native Language Identification (NLI) - the task of identifying the native language (L1) of a person based on their writing in the second language (L2) - has applications in forensics, marketing, and second language acquisition. Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhusudan Ghosh, Shrimon Mukherjee, Asmit Ganguly, Partha Basuchowdhuri, Sudip Kumar Naskar, Debasis Ganguly</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in the publication of clinical trial reports, making it challenging to conduct systematic reviews. Automatically extracting Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) from clinical trial studies can alleviate the traditionally time-consuming process of manually scrutinizing systematic reviews. Existing approaches of PICO frame extraction involves supervised approach that relies on the existence of manually annotated data points in the form of BIO label tagging. Recent approaches, such as In-Context Learning (ICL), which has been shown to be effective for a number of downstream NLP tasks, require the use of labeled examples. In this work, we adopt ICL strategy by employing the pretrained knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), gathered during the pretraining phase of an LLM, to automatically extract the PICO-related terminologies from clinical trial documents in unsupervised set up to bypass the availability of large number of annotated data instances. Additionally, to showcase the highest effectiveness of LLM in oracle scenario where large number of annotated samples are available, we adopt the instruction tuning strategy by employing Low Rank Adaptation (LORA) to conduct the training of gigantic model in low resource environment for the PICO frame extraction task. Our empirical results show that our proposed ICL-based framework produces comparable results on all the version of EBM-NLP datasets and the proposed instruction tuned version of our framework produces state-of-the-art results on all the different EBM-NLP datasets.

<p>Abstract: This article benchmarked the ability of OpenAI's GPTs and a number of open-source LLMs to perform annotation tasks on political content. We used a novel protest event dataset comprising more than three million digital interactions and created a gold standard that includes ground-truth labels annotated by human coders about toxicity and incivility on social media. We included in our benchmark Google's Perspective algorithm, which, along with GPTs, was employed throughout their respective APIs while the open-source LLMs were deployed locally. The findings show that Perspective API using a laxer threshold, GPT-4o, and Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral outperform other LLM's zero-shot classification annotations. In addition, Nous Hermes 2 and Mistral OpenOrca, with a smaller number of parameters, are able to perform the task with high performance, being attractive options that could offer good trade-offs between performance, implementing costs and computing time. Ancillary findings using experiments setting different temperature levels show that although GPTs tend to show not only excellent computing time but also overall good levels of reliability, only open-source LLMs ensure full reproducibility in the annotation.</p>

To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing, we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC) challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs.

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a system that generates synthetic free-text medical records, such as discharge summaries, admission notes and doctor correspondences, using Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Our system is designed to preserve the critical information of the records while introducing significant diversity and minimizing re-identification risk. The system incorporates a de-identification component that uses Philter to mask Protected Health Information (PHI), followed by a Medical Entity Recognition (NER) model to retain key medical information. We explore various masking ratios and mask-filling techniques to balance the trade-off between diversity and fidelity in the synthetic outputs without affecting overall readability. Our results demonstrate that the system can produce high-quality synthetic data with significant diversity while achieving a HIPAA-compliant PHI recall rate of 0.96 and a low re-identification risk of 0.035. Furthermore, downstream evaluations using a NER task reveal that the synthetic data can be effectively used to train models with performance comparable to those trained on real data. The flexibility of the system allows it to be adapted for specific use cases, making it a valuable tool for privacy-preserving data generation in medical research and healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faiza Qamar, Seemab Latif, Rabia Latif</p>
<p>Abstract: Accessing and comprehending religious texts, particularly the Quran (the sacred scripture of Islam) and Ahadith (the corpus of the sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad), in today's digital era necessitates efficient and accurate Question-Answering (QA) systems. Yet, the scarcity of QA systems tailored specifically to the detailed nature of inquiries about the Quranic Tafsir (explanation, interpretation, context of Quran for clarity) and Ahadith poses significant challenges. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset meticulously crafted for QA purposes within the domain of Quranic Tafsir and Ahadith. This dataset comprises a robust collection of over 73,000 question-answer pairs, standing as the largest reported dataset in this specialized domain. Importantly, both questions and answers within the dataset are meticulously enriched with contextual information, serving as invaluable resources for training and evaluating tailored QA systems. However, while this paper highlights the dataset's contributions and establishes a benchmark for evaluating QA performance in the Quran and Ahadith domains, our subsequent human evaluation uncovered critical insights regarding the limitations of existing automatic evaluation techniques. The discrepancy between automatic evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE scores, and human assessments became apparent. The human evaluation indicated significant disparities: the model's verdict consistency with expert scholars ranged between 11% to 20%, while its contextual understanding spanned a broader spectrum of 50% to 90%. These findings underscore the necessity for evaluation techniques that capture the nuances and complexities inherent in understanding religious texts, surpassing the limitations of traditional automatic metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjong Ok, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Singing voice synthesis and conversion have emerged as significant subdomains of voice generation, leading to much demands on prompt-conditioned generation. Unlike common voice data, generating a singing voice requires an understanding of various associated vocal and musical characteristics, such as the vocal tone of the singer or emotional expressions. However, existing open-source audio-text datasets for voice generation tend to capture only a very limited range of attributes, often missing musical characteristics of the audio. To fill this gap, we introduce S2Cap, an audio-text pair dataset with a diverse set of attributes. S2Cap consists of pairs of textual prompts and music audio samples with a wide range of vocal and musical attributes, including pitch, volume, tempo, mood, singer's gender and age, and musical genre and emotional expression. Utilizing S2Cap, we suggest an effective novel baseline algorithm for singing style captioning. Singing style captioning is a relative task to voice generation that generates text descriptions of vocal characteristics, which we first suggested. First, to mitigate the misalignment between the audio encoder and the text decoder, we present a novel mechanism called CRESCENDO, which utilizes positive-pair similarity learning to synchronize the embedding spaces of a pretrained audio encoder to get similar embeddings with a text encoder. We additionally supervise the model using the singer's voice, which is demixed by the accompaniment. This supervision allows the model to more accurately capture vocal characteristics, leading to improved singing style captions that better reflect the style of the singer. The dataset and the codes are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/S2cap}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown the feasibility and benefit of bootstrapping an integrated sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) linguistic frontend from a traditional pipeline-based frontend for text-to-speech (TTS). To overcome the fixed lexical coverage of bootstrapping training data, previous work has proposed to leverage easily accessible transcribed speech audio as an additional training source for acquiring novel pronunciation knowledge for uncovered words, which relies on an auxiliary ASR model as part of a cumbersome implementation flow. In this work, we propose an alternative method to leverage transcribed speech audio as an additional training source, based on multi-task learning (MTL). Experiments show that, compared to a baseline Seq2Seq frontend, the proposed MTL-based method reduces PER from 2.5% to 1.6% for those word types covered exclusively in transcribed speech audio, achieving a similar performance to the previous method but with a much simpler implementation flow.</p>

While previous methods employ explicit questionnaires, often derived from the Big Five model of personality, we hypothesize that LLMs implicitly encode notions of personality when modeling next-token responses. To demonstrate this, we introduce a novel approach that uncovers latent personality dimensions in LLMs by applying singular value de-composition (SVD) to the log-probabilities of trait-descriptive adjectives. Our experiments show that LLMs "rediscover" core personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness without relying on direct questionnaire inputs, with the top-5 factors corresponding to Big Five traits explaining 74.3% of the variance in the latent space. Moreover, we can use the derived principal components to assess personality along the Big Five dimensions, and achieve improvements in average personality prediction accuracy of up to 5% over fine-tuned models, and up to 21% over direct LLM-based scoring techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a paradigm that integrates external contextual information with large language models (LLMs) to enhance factual accuracy and relevance, has emerged as a pivotal area in generative AI. The LLMs used in RAG applications are required to faithfully and completely comprehend the provided context and users' questions, avoid hallucination, handle unanswerable, counterfactual or otherwise low-quality and irrelevant contexts, perform complex multi-hop reasoning and produce reliable citations. In this paper, we introduce SFR-RAG, a small LLM that is instruction-tuned with an emphasis on context-grounded generation and hallucination minimization. We also present ContextualBench, a new evaluation framework compiling multiple popular and diverse RAG benchmarks, such as HotpotQA and TriviaQA, with consistent RAG settings to ensure reproducibility and consistency in model assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our SFR-RAG-9B model outperforms leading baselines such as Command-R+ (104B) and GPT-4o, achieving state-of-the-art results in 3 out of 7 benchmarks in ContextualBench with significantly fewer parameters. The model is also shown to be resilient to alteration in the contextual information and behave appropriately when relevant context is removed. Additionally, the SFR-RAG model maintains competitive performance in general instruction-following tasks and function-calling capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09927">Towards Data Contamination Detection for Modern Large Language Models: Limitations, Inconsistencies, and Oracle Challenges</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinay Samuel, Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models achieve increasingly impressive results, questions arise about whether such performance is from generalizability or mere data memorization. Thus, numerous data contamination detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches are often validated with traditional benchmarks and early-stage LLMs, leaving uncertainty about their effectiveness when evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the contamination of more challenging benchmarks. To address this gap and provide a dual investigation of SOTA LLM contamination status and detection method robustness, we evaluate five contamination detection approaches with four state-of-the-art LLMs across eight challenging datasets often used in modern LLM evaluation. Our analysis reveals that (1) Current methods have non-trivial limitations in their assumptions and practical applications; (2) Notable difficulties exist in detecting contamination introduced during instruction fine-tuning with answer augmentation; and (3) Limited consistencies between SOTA contamination detection techniques. These findings highlight the complexity of contamination detection in advanced LLMs and the urgent need for further research on robust and generalizable contamination evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abe Bohan Hou, William Jurayj, Nils Holzenberger, Andrew Blair-Stanek, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as a writing aid for professionals performing legal analyses. However, LLMs can often hallucinate in this setting, in ways difficult to recognize by non-professionals and existing text evaluation metrics. In this work, we pose the question: when can machine-generated legal analysis be evaluated as acceptable? We introduce the neutral notion of gaps, as opposed to hallucinations in a strict erroneous sense, to refer to the difference between human-written and machine-generated legal analysis. Gaps do not always equate to invalid generation. Working with legal experts, we consider the CLERC generation task proposed in Hou et al. (2024b), leading to a taxonomy, a fine-grained detector for predicting gap categories, and an annotated dataset for automatic evaluation. Our best detector achieves 67% F1 score and 80% precision on the test set. Employing this detector as an automated metric on legal analysis generated by SOTA LLMs, we find around 80% contain hallucinations of different kinds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Shen, Mayank Kejriwal</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years,Text-to-SQL, the problem of automatically converting questions posed in natural language to formal SQL queries, has emerged as an important problem at the intersection of natural language processing and data management research. Large language models (LLMs) have delivered impressive performance when used in an off-the-shelf performance, but still fall significantly short of expected expert-level performance. Errors are especially probable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions, and SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a novel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to yield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks. Specifically, when configured using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base LLM, SelECT-SQL achieves 84.2% execution accuracy on the Spider leaderboard's development set, exceeding both the best results of other baseline GPT-3.5-Turbo-based solutions (81.1%), and the peak performance (83.5%) of the GPT-4 result reported on the leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumera Anjum, Hanzhi Zhang, Wenjun Zhou, Eun Jin Paek, Xiaopeng Zhao, Yunhe Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks, yet they are susceptible to generating inaccurate or unreliable responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. In critical domains such as health and medicine, these hallucinations can pose serious risks. This paper introduces HALO, a novel framework designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of medical question-answering (QA) systems by focusing on the detection and mitigation of hallucinations. Our approach generates multiple variations of a given query using LLMs and retrieves relevant information from external open knowledge bases to enrich the context. We utilize maximum marginal relevance scoring to prioritize the retrieved context, which is then provided to LLMs for answer generation, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations. The integration of LangChain further streamlines this process, resulting in a notable and robust increase in the accuracy of both open-source and commercial LLMs, such as Llama-3.1 (from 44% to 65%) and ChatGPT (from 56% to 70%). This framework underscores the critical importance of addressing hallucinations in medical QA systems, ultimately improving clinical decision-making and patient care.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huawei Ji, Cheng Deng, Bo Xue, Zhouyang Jin, Jiaxin Ding, Xiaoying Gan, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of data-centric AI, the focus has shifted from model-driven approaches to improving data quality. Academic literature, as one of the crucial types, is predominantly stored in PDF formats and needs to be parsed into texts before further processing. However, parsing diverse structured texts in academic literature remains challenging due to the lack of datasets that cover various text structures. In this paper, we introduce AceParse, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the parsing of a wide range of structured texts, including formulas, tables, lists, algorithms, and sentences with embedded mathematical expressions. Based on AceParse, we fine-tuned a multimodal model, named AceParser, which accurately parses various structured texts within academic literature. This model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4.1% in terms of F1 score and by 5% in Jaccard Similarity, demonstrating the potential of multimodal models in academic literature parsing.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038">On the Diagram of Thought</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Yang Yuan, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diagram of Thought (DoT), a framework that models iterative reasoning in large language models (LLMs) as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single model. Unlike traditional approaches that represent reasoning as linear chains or trees, DoT organizes propositions, critiques, refinements, and verifications into a cohesive DAG structure, allowing the model to explore complex reasoning pathways while maintaining logical consistency. Each node in the diagram corresponds to a proposition that has been proposed, critiqued, refined, or verified, enabling the LLM to iteratively improve its reasoning through natural language feedback. By leveraging auto-regressive next-token prediction with role-specific tokens, DoT facilitates seamless transitions between proposing ideas and critically evaluating them, providing richer feedback than binary signals. Furthermore, we formalize the DoT framework using Topos Theory, providing a mathematical foundation that ensures logical consistency and soundness in the reasoning process. This approach enhances both the training and inference processes within a single LLM, eliminating the need for multiple models or external control mechanisms. DoT offers a conceptual framework for designing next-generation reasoning-specialized models, emphasizing training efficiency, robust reasoning capabilities, and theoretical grounding.

<p>Abstract: Activation Editing, which involves directly editting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to alter their behaviors and achieve desired properties, has emerged as a promising area of research. Existing works primarily treat LLMs' activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. However, this approach is limited in its ability to achieve greater performance improvement while maintaining the necessary consistency of activation magnitudes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes. Our method, named Householder Pseudo-Rotation (HPR), mimics the rotation transformation, thus preserving activation norms and resulting in an improved performance on various safety benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Ji, Xinzhe Zheng, Jiawei Sun, Renqi Chen, Wei Gao, Mani Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, affecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the intervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation required from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue behind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those affected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible, stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to provide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge LLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly integrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary Assessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention conversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets spanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices involving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results comparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the model size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM applications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by substituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive, integrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and stigma-free mental health support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunice Akani, Benoit Favre, Frederic Bechet, Romain Gemignani</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to provide a concise and coherent summary of conversations between multiple speakers. While recent advancements in language models have enhanced this process, summarizing dialogues accurately and faithfully remains challenging due to the need to understand speaker interactions and capture relevant information. Indeed, abstractive models used for dialog summarization may generate summaries that contain inconsistencies. We suggest using the semantic information proposed for performing Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) in human-machine dialogue systems for goal-oriented human-human dialogues to obtain a more semantically faithful summary regarding the task. This study introduces three key contributions: First, we propose an exploration of how incorporating task-related information can enhance the summarization process, leading to more semantically accurate summaries. Then, we introduce a new evaluation criterion based on task semantics. Finally, we propose a new dataset version with increased annotated data standardized for research on task-oriented dialogue summarization. The study evaluates these methods using the DECODA corpus, a collection of French spoken dialogues from a call center. Results show that integrating models with task-related information improves summary accuracy, even with varying word error rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Xiao, Yunfei Xu, Jing Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER), whose goal is to recognize domain-specific entities and their categories, provides an important support for constructing domain knowledge graphs. Currently, deep learning-based methods are widely used and effective in NER tasks, but due to the reliance on large-scale labeled data. As a result, the scarcity of labeled data in a specific domain will limit its application.Therefore, many researches started to introduce few-shot methods and achieved some results. However, the entity structures in specific domains are often complex, and the current few-shot methods are difficult to adapt to NER tasks with complex features.Taking the Chinese coal chemical industry domain as an example,there exists a complex structure of multiple entities sharing a single entity, as well as multiple relationships for the same pair of entities, which affects the NER task under the sample less condition.In this paper, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based entity recognition framework LLM-DER for the domain-specific entity recognition problem in Chinese, which enriches the entity information by generating a list of relationships containing entity types through LLMs, and designing a plausibility and consistency evaluation method to remove misrecognized entities, which can effectively solve the complex structural entity recognition problem in a specific domain.The experimental results of this paper on the Resume dataset and the self-constructed coal chemical dataset Coal show that LLM-DER performs outstandingly in domain-specific entity recognition, not only outperforming the existing GPT-3.5-turbo baseline, but also exceeding the fully-supervised baseline, verifying its effectiveness in entity recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryota Komatsu, Takahiro Shinozaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised speech representation learning has become essential for extracting meaningful features from untranscribed audio. Recent advances highlight the potential of deriving discrete symbols from the features correlated with linguistic units, which enables text-less training across diverse tasks. In particular, sentence-level Self-Distillation of the pretrained HuBERT (SD-HuBERT) induces syllabic structures within latent speech frame representations extracted from an intermediate Transformer layer. In SD-HuBERT, sentence-level representation is accumulated from speech frame features through self-attention layers using a special CLS token. However, we observe that the information aggregated in the CLS token correlates more with speaker identity than with linguistic content. To address this, we propose a speech-only self-supervised fine-tuning approach that separates syllabic units from speaker information. Our method introduces speaker perturbation as data augmentation and adopts a frame-level training objective to prevent the CLS token from aggregating paralinguistic information. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art method in most syllable segmentation and syllabic unit quality metrics on Librispeech, underscoring its effectiveness in promoting syllabic organization within speech-only models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baolong Bi, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Hongcheng Gao, Junfeng Fang, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As the modern tool of choice for question answering, large language models (LLMs) are expected to deliver answers with up-to-date knowledge. To achieve such ideal question-answering systems, locating and then editing outdated knowledge in the natural language outputs is a general target of popular knowledge editing methods. However, this target is challenging, as both identifying which tokens to edit in the reasoning steps and ensuring the coherence of the revised reasoning chain are difficult tasks. We argue that these challenges stem from the unstructured nature of natural language outputs. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{Stru}$ctural $\textbf{Edit}$ing ($\textbf{StruEdit}$), an improved baseline for knowledge editing. We first prompt LLMs to produce structured outputs consisting of reasoning triplets. Then, StruEdit removes any potentially outdated knowledge and efficiently refills the structured outputs with up-to-date information in a single step. Experimental results show that StruEdit consistently delivers the highest accuracy with lowest latency compared with other knowledge editing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Amann, Zhaolin Li, Barbara Bruno, Jan Niehues</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech disfluency commonly occurs in conversational and spontaneous speech. However, standard Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models struggle to accurately recognize these disfluencies because they are typically trained on fluent transcripts. Current research mainly focuses on detecting disfluencies within transcripts, overlooking their exact location and duration in the speech. Additionally, previous work often requires model fine-tuning and addresses limited types of disfluencies.
  In this work, we present an inference-only approach to augment any ASR model with the ability to detect open-set disfluencies. We first demonstrate that ASR models have difficulty transcribing speech disfluencies. Next, this work proposes a modified Connectionist Temporal Classification(CTC)-based forced alignment algorithm from \cite{kurzinger2020ctc} to predict word-level timestamps while effectively capturing disfluent speech. Additionally, we develop a model to classify alignment gaps between timestamps as either containing disfluent speech or silence. This model achieves an accuracy of 81.62\% and an F1-score of 80.07\%. We test the augmentation pipeline of alignment gap detection and classification on a disfluent dataset. Our results show that we captured 74.13\% of the words that were initially missed by the transcription, demonstrating the potential of this pipeline for downstream tasks.</p>

Findings indicate that GPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and struggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while clinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of the large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these discrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These results underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions and interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential in healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical decision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles, complementing clinical expertise.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navya Jain, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Airlie Hilliard, Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim, Philip Treleaven</p>
<p>Abstract: As the demand for human-like interactions with LLMs continues to grow, so does the interest in manipulating their personality traits, which has emerged as a key area of research. Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability. IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama-2-7B-chat began generating emojis, despite their absence in the PEFT data. For instance, Llama-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-8B-Instruct did so in 92.5% of openness-related test instances.

First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analyzing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as mechanistic interpretability and in-context learning explainability methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Wang, Chun Zhang, Ning Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Knowledge Graph-to-Text Generation task aims to convert structured knowledge graphs into coherent and human-readable natural language text. Recent efforts in this field have focused on enhancing pre-trained language models (PLMs) by incorporating graph structure information to capture the intricate structure details of knowledge graphs. However, most of these approaches tend to capture only single-granularity structure information, concentrating either on the relationships between entities within the original graph or on the relationships between words within the same entity or across different entities. This narrow focus results in a significant limitation: models that concentrate solely on entity-level structure fail to capture the nuanced semantic relationships between words, while those that focus only on word-level structure overlook the broader relationships between original entire entities. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the Multi-granularity Graph Structure Attention (MGSA), which is based on PLMs. The encoder of the model architecture features an entity-level structure encoding module, a word-level structure encoding module, and an aggregation module that synthesizes information from both structure. This multi-granularity structure encoding approach allows the model to simultaneously capture both entity-level and word-level structure information, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge graph's structure information, thereby significantly improving the quality of the generated text. We conducted extensive evaluations of the MGSA model using two widely recognized KG-to-Text Generation benchmark datasets, WebNLG and EventNarrative, where it consistently outperformed models that rely solely on single-granularity structure information, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gurvan Richardeau, Erwan Le Merrer, Camilla Penzo, Gilles Tredan</p>
<p>Abstract: In a parallel with the 20 questions game, we present a method to determine whether two large language models (LLMs), placed in a black-box context, are the same or not. The goal is to use a small set of (benign) binary questions, typically under 20. We formalize the problem and first establish a baseline using a random selection of questions from known benchmark datasets, achieving an accuracy of nearly 100% within 20 questions. After showing optimal bounds for this problem, we introduce two effective questioning heuristics able to discriminate 22 LLMs by using half as many questions for the same task. These methods offer significant advantages in terms of stealth and are thus of interest to auditors or copyright owners facing suspicions of model leaks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Bremm, Patrick Gustav Blaneck, Tobias Bornheim, Niklas Grieger, Stephan Bialonski</p>
<p>Abstract: Sexism in online media comments is a pervasive challenge that often manifests subtly, complicating moderation efforts as interpretations of what constitutes sexism can vary among individuals. We study monolingual and multilingual open-source text embeddings to reliably detect sexism and misogyny in German-language online comments from an Austrian newspaper. We observed classifiers trained on text embeddings to mimic closely the individual judgements of human annotators. Our method showed robust performance in the GermEval 2024 GerMS-Detect Subtask 1 challenge, achieving an average macro F1 score of 0.597 (4th place, as reported on Codabench). It also accurately predicted the distribution of human annotations in GerMS-Detect Subtask 2, with an average Jensen-Shannon distance of 0.301 (2nd place). The computational efficiency of our approach suggests potential for scalable applications across various languages and linguistic contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a knowledge-enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it into the prompt templates to enhance the language model's understanding and reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public datasets: CHIP-CTC, IMCS-V2-NER, and KUAKE-QTR. The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics, with an F1 score improvement of 2.4% on the CHIP-CTC dataset, 3.1% on the IMCS-V2-NER dataset,and 4.2% on the KUAKE-QTR dataset. Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop in F1 score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis but also enhances the interpretability of the predictions, providing more reliable support and evidence for clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting high-dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called DIctionary Label Attention (\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global understanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyang Li, Talha Azfar, Ruimin Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of handling multi-modal input and outputs such as text, voice, images, and video, are transforming the way we process information. Beyond just generating textual responses to prompts, they can integrate with different software platforms to offer comprehensive solutions across diverse applications. In this paper, we present ChatSUMO, a LLM-based agent that integrates language processing skills to generate abstract and real-world simulation scenarios in the widely-used traffic simulator - Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). Our methodology begins by leveraging the LLM for user input which converts to relevant keywords needed to run python scripts. These scripts are designed to convert specified regions into coordinates, fetch data from OpenStreetMap, transform it into a road network, and subsequently run SUMO simulations with the designated traffic conditions. The outputs of the simulations are then interpreted by the LLM resulting in informative comparisons and summaries. Users can continue the interaction and generate a variety of customized scenarios without prior traffic simulation expertise. For simulation generation, we created a real-world simulation for the city of Albany with an accuracy of 96\%. ChatSUMO also realizes the customizing of edge edit, traffic light optimization, and vehicle edit by users effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Klyman</p>
<p>Abstract: As foundation models have accumulated hundreds of millions of users, developers have begun to take steps to prevent harmful types of uses. One salient intervention that foundation model developers adopt is acceptable use policies: legally binding policies that prohibit users from using a model for specific purposes. This paper identifies acceptable use policies from 30 foundation model developers, analyzes the use restrictions they contain, and argues that acceptable use policies are an important lens for understanding the regulation of foundation models. Taken together, developers' acceptable use policies include 127 distinct use restrictions; the wide variety in the number and type of use restrictions may create fragmentation across the AI supply chain. Developers also employ acceptable use policies to prevent competitors or specific industries from making use of their models. Developers alone decide what constitutes acceptable use, and rarely provide transparency about how they enforce their policies. In practice, acceptable use policies are difficult to enforce, and scrupulous enforcement can act as a barrier to researcher access and limit beneficial uses of foundation models. Nevertheless, acceptable use policies for foundation models are an early example of self-regulation that have a significant impact on the market for foundation models and the overall AI ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leah von der Heyde, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Alexander Wenz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are perceived by some as having the potential to revolutionize social science research, considering their training data includes information on human attitudes and behavior. If these attitudes are reflected in LLM output, LLM-generated "synthetic samples" could be used as a viable and efficient alternative to surveys of real humans. However, LLM-synthetic samples might exhibit coverage bias due to training data and fine-tuning processes being unrepresentative of diverse linguistic, social, political, and digital contexts. In this study, we examine to what extent LLM-based predictions of public opinion exhibit context-dependent biases by predicting voting behavior in the 2024 European Parliament elections using a state-of-the-art LLM. We prompt GPT-4-Turbo with anonymized individual-level background information, varying prompt content and language, ask the LLM to predict each person's voting behavior, and compare the weighted aggregates to the real election results. Our findings emphasize the limited applicability of LLM-synthetic samples to public opinion prediction. We show that (1) the LLM-based prediction of future voting behavior largely fails, (2) prediction accuracy is unequally distributed across national and linguistic contexts, and (3) improving LLM predictions requires detailed attitudinal information about individuals for prompting. In investigating the contextual differences of LLM-based predictions of public opinion, our research contributes to the understanding and mitigation of biases and inequalities in the development of LLMs and their applications in computational social science.</p>

To address this issue, we propose zero-shot accent generation that unifies Foreign Accent Conversion (FAC), accented TTS, and ZS-TTS, with a novel two-stage pipeline.

In the second stage, we condition ZS-TTS system on the pretrained speaker-agnostic accent embeddings extracted by the AID model. The proposed system achieves higher accent fidelity on inherent/cross accent generation, and enables unseen accent generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, wearable computing devices (``smart glasses'') have undergone remarkable advancements in sensor technology, design, and processing power, ushering in a new era of opportunity for high-density human behavior data. Equipped with wearable cameras, these glasses offer a unique opportunity to analyze non-verbal behavior in natural settings as individuals interact. Our focus lies in predicting engagement in dyadic interactions by scrutinizing verbal and non-verbal cues, aiming to detect signs of disinterest or confusion. Leveraging such analyses may revolutionize our understanding of human communication, foster more effective collaboration in professional environments, provide better mental health support through empathetic virtual interactions, and enhance accessibility for those with communication barriers.
  In this work, we collect a dataset featuring 34 participants engaged in casual dyadic conversations, each providing self-reported engagement ratings at the end of each conversation. We introduce a novel fusion strategy using Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multiple behavior modalities into a ``multimodal transcript'' that can be processed by an LLM for behavioral reasoning tasks. Remarkably, this method achieves performance comparable to established fusion techniques even in its preliminary implementation, indicating strong potential for further research and optimization. This fusion method is one of the first to approach ``reasoning'' about real-world human behavior through a language model. Smart glasses provide us the ability to unobtrusively gather high-density multimodal data on human behavior, paving the way for new approaches to understanding and improving human communication with the potential for important societal benefits. The features and data collected during the studies will be made publicly available to promote further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting and classifying suspicious or malicious domain names and URLs is fundamental task in cybersecurity. To leverage such indicators of compromise, cybersecurity vendors and practitioners often maintain and update blacklists of known malicious domains and URLs. However, blacklists frequently fail to identify emerging and obfuscated threats. Over the past few decades, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that automatically detect malicious domains and URLs, addressing the limitations of blacklists maintenance and updates. In this paper, we introduce DomURLs_BERT, a pre-trained BERT-based encoder adapted for detecting and classifying suspicious/malicious domains and URLs. DomURLs_BERT is pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective on a large multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) dataset. In order to assess the performance of DomURLs_BERT, we have conducted experiments on several binary and multi-class classification tasks involving domain names and URLs, covering phishing, malware, DGA, and DNS tunneling. The evaluations results show that the proposed encoder outperforms state-of-the-art character-based deep learning models and cybersecurity-focused BERT models across multiple tasks and datasets. The pre-training dataset, the pre-trained DomURLs_BERT encoder, and the experiments source code are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address a challenging task, synchronous motion captioning, that aim to generate a language description synchronized with human motion sequences. This task pertains to numerous applications, such as aligned sign language transcription, unsupervised action segmentation and temporal grounding. Our method introduces mechanisms to control self- and cross-attention distributions of the Transformer, allowing interpretability and time-aligned text generation. We achieve this through masking strategies and structuring losses that push the model to maximize attention only on the most important frames contributing to the generation of a motion word. These constraints aim to prevent undesired mixing of information in attention maps and to provide a monotonic attention distribution across tokens. Thus, the cross attentions of tokens are used for progressive text generation in synchronization with human motion sequences. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through evaluation on the two available benchmark datasets, KIT-ML and HumanML3D. As visual evaluation is essential for this task, we provide a comprehensive set of animated visual illustrations in the code repository: https://github.com/rd20karim/Synch-Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru, Oriol Nieto, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary audio-language models, like CLAP, offer a promising approach for zero-shot audio classification (ZSAC) by enabling classification with any arbitrary set of categories specified with natural language prompts. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to improve ZSAC with CLAP. Specifically, we shift from the conventional method of using prompts with abstract category labels (e.g., Sound of an organ) to prompts that describe sounds using their inherent descriptive features in a diverse context (e.g.,The organ's deep and resonant tones filled the cathedral.). To achieve this, we first propose ReCLAP, a CLAP model trained with rewritten audio captions for improved understanding of sounds in the wild. These rewritten captions describe each sound event in the original caption using their unique discriminative characteristics. ReCLAP outperforms all baselines on both multi-modal audio-text retrieval and ZSAC. Next, to improve zero-shot audio classification with ReCLAP, we propose prompt augmentation. In contrast to the traditional method of employing hand-written template prompts, we generate custom prompts for each unique label in the dataset. These custom prompts first describe the sound event in the label and then employ them in diverse scenes. Our proposed method improves ReCLAP's performance on ZSAC by 1%-18% and outperforms all baselines by 1% - 55%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxi Ye, Grace Chu, Yanfeng Liu, Yichi Zhang, Lukasz Lew, Andrew Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce obstacles to backpropagation. This is particularly challenging when training deep neural networks in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. We propose a novel, robust, and universal solution: a denoising affine transform that stabilizes training under these challenging conditions. By formulating quantization and sparsification as perturbations during training, we derive a perturbation-resilient approach based on ridge regression. Our solution employs a piecewise constant backbone model to ensure a performance lower bound and features an inherent noise reduction mechanism to mitigate perturbation-induced corruption. This formulation allows existing models to be trained at arbitrarily low precision and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes. Furthermore, our method provides a novel perspective on training temporal binary neural networks, contributing to ongoing efforts to narrow the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Owing to the unprecedented capability in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, the pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown fantastic potential in developing the next-generation recommender systems (RSs). However, the static index paradigm adopted by current methods greatly restricts the utilization of LLMs capacity for recommendation, leading to not only the insufficient alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge, but also the neglect of high-order user-item interaction patterns. In this paper, we propose Twin-Tower Dynamic Semantic Recommender (TTDS), the first generative RS which adopts dynamic semantic index paradigm, targeting at resolving the above problems simultaneously. To be more specific, we for the first time contrive a dynamic knowledge fusion framework which integrates a twin-tower semantic token generator into the LLM-based recommender, hierarchically allocating meaningful semantic index for items and users, and accordingly predicting the semantic index of target item. Furthermore, a dual-modality variational auto-encoder is proposed to facilitate multi-grained alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge. Eventually, a series of novel tuning tasks specially customized for capturing high-order user-item interaction patterns are proposed to take advantages of user historical behavior. Extensive experiments across three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology in developing LLM-based generative RSs. The proposed TTDS recommender achieves an average improvement of 19.41% in Hit-Rate and 20.84% in NDCG metric, compared with the leading baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Yang, Yining Hong, Grace A. Lewis, Tongshuang Wu, Christian K\"astner</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models make mistakes, yet sometimes it is difficult to identify the systematic problems behind the mistakes. Practitioners engage in various activities, including error analysis, testing, auditing, and red-teaming, to form hypotheses of what can go (or has gone) wrong with their models. To validate these hypotheses, practitioners employ data slicing to identify relevant examples. However, traditional data slicing is limited by available features and programmatic slicing functions. In this work, we propose SemSlicer, a framework that supports semantic data slicing, which identifies a semantically coherent slice, without the need for existing features. SemSlicer uses Large Language Models to annotate datasets and generate slices from any user-defined slicing criteria. We show that SemSlicer generates accurate slices with low cost, allows flexible trade-offs between different design dimensions, reliably identifies under-performing data slices, and helps practitioners identify useful data slices that reflect systematic problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become a key use-case in several applications to aid user experience, particularly after Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieving good results in zero-shot inference. But evaluating different VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating VLMs tailored to VQA tasks in practical settings. We present a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, three key practical aspects on which tasks can vary. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that no single model excelling universally, making appropriate selection a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, though open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B demonstrate competitive strengths in specific contexts, while providing additional advantages. This study guides the selection of VLMs based on specific task requirements and resource constraints, and can also be extended to other vision-language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> C. B. Pronin, A. V. Volosova, A. V. Ostroukh, Yu. N. Strogov</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, an approach to training and evaluating an adapter model for the popular language model "zephyr-7b-beta" is described. The adapter was developed to improve the performance of the base model in tasks related to programming and understanding the Russian language. Considering the high quality of the original model in tasks in the English language, the goal of the research was to expand its linguistic and technical spectrum. The proposed adapter was trained using a large and diverse dataset, including question-answer pairs related to programming, as well code-related texts in Russian language. The applied training methodology ensures an improvement in the model's quality of answers in understanding and generating Python code based on Russian instructions. We evaluated the performance of the base model with the installed adapter using various metrics, comparing it to the base model as well as other state-of-the-art models in this field. The obtained results showed significant improvement, both in tasks related to writing Python code and in processing the Russian language, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed adapter.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunlong Chen, Junjun Wang, Zhaoqun Chen, Kunjin Chen, Yitian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We participated in the KDD CUP 2024 paper source tracing competition and achieved the 3rd place. This competition tasked participants with identifying the reference sources (i.e., ref-sources, as referred to by the organizers of the competition) of given academic papers. Unlike most teams that addressed this challenge by fine-tuning pre-trained neural language models such as BERT or ChatGLM, our primary approach utilized closed-source large language models (LLMs). With recent advancements in LLM technology, closed-source LLMs have demonstrated the capability to tackle complex reasoning tasks in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. Consequently, in the absence of GPUs, we employed closed-source LLMs to directly generate predicted reference sources from the provided papers. We further refined these predictions through ensemble learning. Notably, our method was the only one among the award-winning approaches that did not require the use of GPUs for model training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Huang, Jie M. Zhang, Mingzhe Du, Mark Harman, Heming Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist test generation with the source code under test provided as the context. This paper aims to answer the question: If the source code under test is incorrect, will LLMs be misguided when generating tests? The effectiveness of test cases is measured by their accuracy, coverage, and bug detection effectiveness. Our evaluation results with five open- and six closed-source LLMs on four datasets demonstrate that incorrect code can significantly mislead LLMs in generating correct, high-coverage, and bug-revealing tests. For instance, in the HumanEval dataset, LLMs achieve 80.45% test accuracy when provided with task descriptions and correct code, but only 57.12% when given task descriptions and incorrect code. For the APPS dataset, prompts with correct code yield tests that detect 39.85% of the bugs, while prompts with incorrect code detect only 19.61%. These findings have important implications for the deployment of LLM-based testing: using it on mature code may help protect against future regression, but on early-stage immature code, it may simply bake in errors. Our findings also underscore the need for further research to improve LLMs resilience against incorrect code in generating reliable and bug-revealing tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Clinton, Robert Lieck</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning approaches to offline reinforcement learning, particularly those utilizing the Decision Transformer, have shown effectiveness in continuous environments and for sparse rewards. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to the high compounding error of auto-regressive models. To overcome this limitation, we go beyond next-token prediction and introduce Planning Tokens, which contain high-level, long time-scale information about the agent's future. Predicting dual time-scale tokens at regular intervals enables our model to use these long-horizon Planning Tokens as a form of implicit planning to guide its low-level policy and reduce compounding error. This architectural modification significantly enhances performance on long-horizon tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art in complex D4RL environments. Additionally, we demonstrate that Planning Tokens improve the interpretability of the model's policy through the interpretable plan visualisations and attention map.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyao Li, Wei Xia, Kounianhua Du, Xinyi Dai, Ruiming Tang, Yasheng Wang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM agents enhanced by tree search algorithms have yielded notable performances in code generation. However, current search algorithms in this domain suffer from low search quality due to several reasons: 1) Ineffective design of the search space for the high-reasoning demands of code generation tasks, 2) Inadequate integration of code feedback with the search algorithm, and 3) Poor handling of negative feedback during the search, leading to reduced search efficiency and quality. To address these challenges, we propose to search for the reasoning process of the code and use the detailed feedback of code execution to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. In this paper, we introduce RethinkMCTS, which employs the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to conduct thought-level searches before generating code, thereby exploring a wider range of strategies. More importantly, we construct verbal feedback from fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. This ensures that the search progresses along the correct reasoning paths, thus improving the overall search quality of the tree by leveraging execution feedback. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-based code generation baselines. On the HumanEval dataset, it improves the pass@1 of GPT-3.5-turbo from 70.12 to 89.02 and GPT-4o-mini from 87.20 to 94.51. It effectively conducts more thorough exploration through thought-level searches and enhances the search quality of the entire tree by incorporating rethink operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hua Shen, Tiffany Knearem, Reshmi Ghosh, Yu-Ju Yang, Tanushree Mitra, Yun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems become more advanced, ensuring their alignment with a diverse range of individuals and societal values becomes increasingly critical. But how can we capture fundamental human values and assess the degree to which AI systems align with them? We introduce ValueCompass, a framework of fundamental values, grounded in psychological theory and a systematic review, to identify and evaluate human-AI alignment. We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and language models (LMs) across four real-world vignettes: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings uncover risky misalignment between humans and LMs, such as LMs agreeing with values like "Choose Own Goals", which are largely disagreed by humans. We also observe values vary across vignettes, underscoring the necessity for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, offering foundations for developing AI that responsibly reflects societal values and ethics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Judy Hanwen Shen, Archit Sharma, Jun Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.</p>

<p>Abstract: Expressing stressful experiences in words is proven to improve mental and physical health, but individuals often disengage with writing interventions as they struggle to organize their thoughts and emotions. Reflective prompts have been used to provide direction, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to provide tailored guidance. Current systems often limit users' flexibility to direct their reflections. We thus present ExploreSelf, an LLM-driven application designed to empower users to control their reflective journey. ExploreSelf allows users to receive adaptive support through dynamically generated questions. Through an exploratory study with 19 participants, we examine how participants explore and reflect on personal challenges using ExploreSelf. Our findings demonstrate that participants valued the balance between guided support and freedom to control their reflective journey, leading to deeper engagement and insight. Building on our findings, we discuss implications for designing LLM-driven tools that promote user empowerment through effective reflective practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justas Andriu\v{s}kevi\v{c}ius, Junzi Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in language models have created new opportunities in air traffic control studies. The current focus is primarily on text and language-based use cases. However, these language models may offer a higher potential impact in the air traffic control domain, thanks to their ability to interact with air traffic environments in an embodied agent form. They also provide a language-like reasoning capability to explain their decisions, which has been a significant roadblock for the implementation of automatic air traffic control.
  This paper investigates the application of a language model-based agent with function-calling and learning capabilities to resolve air traffic conflicts without human intervention. The main components of this research are foundational large language models, tools that allow the agent to interact with the simulator, and a new concept, the experience library. An innovative part of this research, the experience library, is a vector database that stores synthesized knowledge that agents have learned from interactions with the simulations and language models.
  To evaluate the performance of our language model-based agent, both open-source and closed-source models were tested. The results of our study reveal significant differences in performance across various configurations of the language model-based agents. The best-performing configuration was able to solve almost all 120 but one imminent conflict scenarios, including up to four aircraft at the same time. Most importantly, the agents are able to provide human-level text explanations on traffic situations and conflict resolution strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuehan Zhang, Peizhuo Lv, Yinpeng Liu, Yongqiang Ma, Wei Lu, Xiaofeng Wang, Xiaozhong Liu, Jiawei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of LLMs brings both convenience and potential threats. As costumed and private LLMs are widely applied, model copyright protection has become important. Text watermarking is emerging as a promising solution to AI-generated text detection and model protection issues. However, current text watermarks have largely ignored the critical need for injecting different watermarks for different users, which could help attribute the watermark to a specific individual. In this paper, we explore the personalized text watermarking scheme for LLM copyright protection and other scenarios, ensuring accountability and traceability in content generation. Specifically, we propose a novel text watermarking method PersonaMark that utilizes sentence structure as the hidden medium for the watermark information and optimizes the sentence-level generation algorithm to minimize disruption to the model's natural generation process. By employing a personalized hashing function to inject unique watermark signals for different users, personalized watermarked text can be obtained. Since our approach performs on sentence level instead of token probability, the text quality is highly preserved. The injection process of unique watermark signals for different users is time-efficient for a large number of users with the designed multi-user hashing function. As far as we know, we achieved personalized text watermarking for the first time through this. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four different LLMs in terms of perplexity, sentiment polarity, alignment, readability, etc. The results demonstrate that our method maintains performance with minimal perturbation to the model's behavior, allows for unbiased insertion of watermark information, and exhibits strong watermark recognition capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: d/Deaf and hearing song-signers become prevalent on video-sharing platforms, but translating songs into sign language remains cumbersome and inaccessible. Our formative study revealed the challenges song-signers face, including semantic, syntactic, expressive, and rhythmic considerations in translations. We present ELMI, an accessible song-signing tool that assists in translating lyrics into sign language. ELMI enables users to edit glosses line-by-line, with real-time synced lyric highlighting and music video snippets. Users can also chat with a large language model-driven AI to discuss meaning, glossing, emoting, and timing. Through an exploratory study with 13 song-signers, we examined how ELMI facilitates their workflows and how song-signers leverage and receive an LLM-driven chat for translation. Participants successfully adopted ELMI to song-signing, with active discussions on the fly. They also reported improved confidence and independence in their translations, finding ELMI encouraging, constructive, and informative. We discuss design implications for leveraging LLMs in culturally sensitive song-signing translations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan-Hong Liao, Rafid Mahmood, Sanja Fidler, David Acuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances demonstrating vision-language models' (VLMs) abilities to describe complex relationships in images using natural language, their capability to quantitatively reason about object sizes and distances remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a manually annotated benchmark, Q-Spatial Bench, with 271 questions across five categories designed for quantitative spatial reasoning and systematically investigate the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs on this task. Our analysis reveals that reasoning about distances between objects is particularly challenging for SoTA VLMs; however, some VLMs significantly outperform others, with an over 40-point gap between the two best performing models. We also make the surprising observation that the success rate of the top-performing VLM increases by 19 points when a reasoning path using a reference object emerges naturally in the response. Inspired by this observation, we develop a zero-shot prompting technique, SpatialPrompt, that encourages VLMs to answer quantitative spatial questions using reference objects as visual cues. By instructing VLMs to use reference objects in their reasoning paths via SpatialPrompt, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and GPT-4V improve their success rates by over 40, 20, and 30 points, respectively. We emphasize that these significant improvements are obtained without needing more data, model architectural modifications, or fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly grown into a pivotal paradigm in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). While much of the current research in this field focuses on performance optimization, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency, the trustworthiness of RAG systems remains an area still under exploration. From a positive perspective, RAG systems are promising to enhance LLMs by providing them with useful and up-to-date knowledge from vast external databases, thereby mitigating the long-standing problem of hallucination. While from a negative perspective, RAG systems are at the risk of generating undesirable contents if the retrieved information is either inappropriate or poorly utilized. To address these concerns, we propose a unified framework that assesses the trustworthiness of RAG systems across six key dimensions: factuality, robustness, fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. Within this framework, we thoroughly review the existing literature on each dimension. Additionally, we create the evaluation benchmark regarding the six dimensions and conduct comprehensive evaluations for a variety of proprietary and open-source models. Finally, we identify the potential challenges for future research based on our investigation results. Through this work, we aim to lay a structured foundation for future investigations and provide practical insights for enhancing the trustworthiness of RAG systems in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolai Dorka</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Ye, Qiong Wu, Wenhao Lin, Yiyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation. Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop. Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes. Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Zhiqing Cui, Guisong Yang, Usman Naseem</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> T\'eo Guichoux, Laure Soulier, Nicolas Obin, Catherine Pelachaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Co-speech gestures are fundamental for communication. The advent of recent deep learning techniques has facilitated the creation of lifelike, synchronous co-speech gestures for Embodied Conversational Agents. "In-the-wild" datasets, aggregating video content from platforms like YouTube via human pose detection technologies, provide a feasible solution by offering 2D skeletal sequences aligned with speech. Concurrent developments in lifting models enable the conversion of these 2D sequences into 3D gesture databases. However, it is important to note that the 3D poses estimated from the 2D extracted poses are, in essence, approximations of the ground-truth, which remains in the 2D domain. This distinction raises questions about the impact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated motions - a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. Our study examines the effect of using either 2D or 3D joint coordinates as training data on the performance of speech-to-gesture deep generative models. We employ a lifting model for converting generated 2D pose sequences into 3D and assess how gestures created directly in 3D stack up against those initially generated in 2D and then converted to 3D. We perform an objective evaluation using widely used metrics in the gesture generation field as well as a user study to qualitatively evaluate the different approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates. This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents Meta-Whisper, a novel approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages using the Whisper model. By leveraging Meta In-Context Learning (Meta-ICL) and a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for sample selection, Meta-Whisper enhances Whisper's ability to recognize speech in unfamiliar languages without extensive fine-tuning. Experiments on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that Meta-Whisper significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) for low-resource languages compared to the original Whisper model. This method offers a promising solution for developing more adaptable multilingual ASR systems, particularly for languages with limited resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates classifier-free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or content-based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion, they do not incorporate classifier-free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance and also incorporates classifier-free guidance. Our findings show improvements over state-of-the-art recommender systems for most metrics for several recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is sparse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Bj\"orn Hoffmeister</p>
<p>Abstract: Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from single-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We accomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and context-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision approaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative WER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on public synthetic data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important in various domains. However, the quadratic time complexity of attention operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to accelerate attention computation. To leverage the dynamic sparse property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones via vector search during generation. Due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity. RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention, and addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time complexity. RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of long-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the model accuracy. Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haode Zhang, Yuwei Zhang, Li-Ming Zhan, Jiaxin Chen, Guangyuan Shi, Albert Y. S. Lam, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of pre-training for few-shot intent classification. While existing paradigms commonly further pre-train language models such as BERT on a vast amount of unlabeled corpus, we find it highly effective and efficient to simply fine-tune BERT with a small set of labeled utterances from public datasets. Specifically, fine-tuning BERT with roughly 1,000 labeled data yields a pre-trained model -- IntentBERT, which can easily surpass the performance of existing pre-trained models for few-shot intent classification on novel domains with very different semantics. The high effectiveness of IntentBERT confirms the feasibility and practicality of few-shot intent detection, and its high generalization ability across different domains suggests that intent classification tasks may share a similar underlying structure, which can be efficiently learned from a small set of labeled data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haode Zhang, Haowen Liang, Yuwei Zhang, Liming Zhan, Xiaolei Lu, Albert Y. S. Lam, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is challenging to train a good intent classifier for a task-oriented dialogue system with only a few annotations. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning pre-trained language models with a small amount of labeled utterances from public benchmarks in a supervised manner is extremely helpful. However, we find that supervised pre-training yields an anisotropic feature space, which may suppress the expressive power of the semantic representations. Inspired by recent research in isotropization, we propose to improve supervised pre-training by regularizing the feature space towards isotropy. We propose two regularizers based on contrastive learning and correlation matrix respectively, and demonstrate their effectiveness through extensive experiments. Our main finding is that it is promising to regularize supervised pre-training with isotropization to further improve the performance of few-shot intent detection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haode Zhang, Haowen Liang, Liming Zhan, Albert Y. S. Lam, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the task of few-shot intent detection, which involves training a deep learning model to classify utterances based on their underlying intents using only a small amount of labeled data. The current approach to address this problem is through continual pre-training, i.e., fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on external resources (e.g., conversational corpora, public intent detection datasets, or natural language understanding datasets) before using them as utterance encoders for training an intent classifier. In this paper, we show that continual pre-training may not be essential, since the overfitting problem of PLMs on this task may not be as serious as expected. Specifically, we find that directly fine-tuning PLMs on only a handful of labeled examples already yields decent results compared to methods that employ continual pre-training, and the performance gap diminishes rapidly as the number of labeled data increases. To maximize the utilization of the limited available data, we propose a context augmentation method and leverage sequential self-distillation to boost performance. Comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmarks show that given only two or more labeled samples per class, direct fine-tuning outperforms many strong baselines that utilize external data sources for continual pre-training.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09841">Are Large Language Models Really Good Logical Reasoners? A Comprehensive Evaluation and Beyond</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangzhi Xu, Qika Lin, Jiawei Han, Tianzhe Zhao, Jun Liu, Erik Cambria</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical reasoning consistently plays a fundamental and significant role in the domains of knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a noteworthy innovation in natural language processing (NLP). However, the question of whether LLMs can effectively address the task of logical reasoning, which requires gradual cognitive inference similar to human intelligence, remains unanswered. To this end, we aim to bridge this gap and provide comprehensive evaluations in this paper. Firstly, to offer systematic evaluations, we select fifteen typical logical reasoning datasets and organize them into deductive, inductive, abductive and mixed-form reasoning settings. Considering the comprehensiveness of evaluations, we include 3 early-era representative LLMs and 4 trending LLMs. Secondly, different from previous evaluations relying only on simple metrics (e.g., \emph{accuracy}), we propose fine-level evaluations in objective and subjective manners, covering both answers and explanations, including \emph{answer correctness}, \emph{explain correctness}, \emph{explain completeness} and \emph{explain redundancy}. Additionally, to uncover the logical flaws of LLMs, problematic cases will be attributed to five error types from two dimensions, i.e., \emph{evidence selection process} and \emph{reasoning process}. Thirdly, to avoid the influences of knowledge bias and concentrate purely on benchmarking the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a new dataset with neutral content. Based on the in-depth evaluations, this paper finally forms a general evaluation scheme of logical reasoning capability from six dimensions (i.e., \emph{Correct}, \emph{Rigorous}, \emph{Self-aware}, \emph{Active}, \emph{Oriented} and \emph{No hallucination}). It reflects the pros and cons of LLMs and gives guiding directions for future works.</p>

<p>Abstract: We outline an unsupervised method for temporal rank ordering of sets of historical documents, namely American State of the Union Addresses and DEEDS, a corpus of medieval English property transfer documents. Our method relies upon effectively capturing the gradual change in word usage via a bandwidth estimate for the non-parametric Generalized Linear Models (Fan, Heckman, and Wand, 1995). The number of possible rank orders needed to search through for cost functions related to the bandwidth can be quite large, even for a small set of documents. We tackle this problem of combinatorial optimization using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, which allows us to obtain the optimal document temporal orders. Our rank ordering method significantly improved the temporal sequencing of both corpora compared to a randomly sequenced baseline. This unsupervised approach should enable the temporal ordering of undated document sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoon Kyung Lee, Inju Lee, Minjung Shin, Seoyeon Bae, Sowon Hahn</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method, the Chain of Empathy (CoE) prompting, that utilizes insights from psychotherapy to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about human emotional states. This method is inspired by various psychotherapy approaches including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Person Centered Therapy (PCT), and Reality Therapy (RT), each leading to different patterns of interpreting clients' mental states. LLMs without reasoning generated predominantly exploratory responses. However, when LLMs used CoE reasoning, we found a more comprehensive range of empathetic responses aligned with the different reasoning patterns of each psychotherapy model. The CBT based CoE resulted in the most balanced generation of empathetic responses. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the emotional context and how it affects human and AI communication. Our research contributes to understanding how psychotherapeutic models can be incorporated into LLMs, facilitating the development of context-specific, safer, and empathetic AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adapting a language model into a specific domain, a.k.a `domain adaption', is a common practice when specialized knowledge, e.g. medicine, is not encapsulated in a general language model like Llama2. The challenge lies in the heterogeneity of data across the two training stages, as it varies in languages, genres, or formats. To tackle this and simplify the learning protocol, we propose to transform heterogeneous data, from the both pre-training and supervised stages, into a unified, simple input-output pair format. We validate the new protocol in the domains where proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT perform relatively poorly, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine. The developed model, HuatuoGPT-II, has shown state-of-the-art performance in Chinese medicine domain on a number of benchmarks, e.g. medical licensing exams. It even outperforms proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 in some aspects, especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Expert manual evaluations further validate HuatuoGPT-II's advantages over existing LLMs. Notably, HuatuoGPT-II was benchmarked in a fresh Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination where it achieved the best performance, showcasing not only its effectiveness but also its generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have broadened the scope of AI applications. Existing automatic evaluation methodologies for MLLMs are mainly limited in evaluating queries without considering user experiences, inadequately addressing the nuances of creative and associative multimodal tasks. However, the open-ended and subjective nature of such tasks poses a significant challenge to the evaluation methodology, where it is difficult to define the ground-truth answers for them. To this end, in our paper, we propose a new evaluation paradigm for MLLMs, which is evaluating MLLMs with per-sample criteria using potent MLLM as the judge. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of this paradigm, we design a benchmark, dubbed MLLM-Bench, by curating the evaluation samples across six comprehensive cognitive levels. We benchmark 21 popular MLLMs in a pairwise-comparison fashion, showing diverse performance across models. Moreover, the validity of our benchmark manifests itself in reaching 88.02% agreement with human evaluation. We contend that the proposed paradigm explores the potential of MLLMs as effective evaluation tools with the help of per-sample criteria.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mat\'u\v{s} Falis, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Hang Dong, Luke Daines, Siddharth Basetti, Michael Holder, Rose S Penfold, Alexandra Birch, Beatrice Alex</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To investigate GPT-3.5 in generating and coding medical documents with ICD-10 codes for data augmentation on low-resources labels.
  Materials and Methods: Employing GPT-3.5 we generated and coded 9,606 discharge summaries based on lists of ICD-10 code descriptions of patients with infrequent (generation) codes within the MIMIC-IV dataset. Combined with the baseline training set, this formed an augmented training set. Neural coding models were trained on baseline and augmented data and evaluated on a MIMIC-IV test set. We report micro- and macro-F1 scores on the full codeset, generation codes, and their families. Weak Hierarchical Confusion Matrices were employed to determine within-family and outside-of-family coding errors in the latter codesets. The coding performance of GPT-3.5 was evaluated both on prompt-guided self-generated data and real MIMIC-IV data. Clinical professionals evaluated the clinical acceptability of the generated documents.
  Results: Augmentation slightly hinders the overall performance of the models but improves performance for the generation candidate codes and their families, including one unseen in the baseline training data. Augmented models display lower out-of-family error rates. GPT-3.5 can identify ICD-10 codes by the prompted descriptions, but performs poorly on real data. Evaluators note the correctness of generated concepts while suffering in variety, supporting information, and narrative.
  Discussion and Conclusion: GPT-3.5 alone is unsuitable for ICD-10 coding. Augmentation positively affects generation code families but mainly benefits codes with existing examples. Augmentation reduces out-of-family errors. Discharge summaries generated by GPT-3.5 state prompted concepts correctly but lack variety, and authenticity in narratives. They are unsuitable for clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) attempt to predict whether a particular datapoint is a member of a target model's training data. Despite extensive research on traditional machine learning models, there has been limited work studying MIA on the pre-training data of large language models (LLMs). We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters. We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Our further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We identify specific settings where LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference and show that the apparent success in such settings can be attributed to a distribution shift, such as when members and non-members are drawn from the seemingly identical domain but with different temporal ranges. We release our code and data as a unified benchmark package that includes all existing MIAs, supporting future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Theory based AI research has had a hard time recently and the aim here is to propose a model of what LLMs are actually doing when they impress us with their language skills. The model integrates three established theories of human decision-making from philosophy, sociology, and computer science. The paper starts with the collective understanding of reasoning from the early days of AI research - primarily because that model is how we humans think we think, and is the most accessible. It then describes what is commonly thought of as "reactive systems" which is the position taken by many philosophers and indeed many contemporary AI researchers. The third component to the proposed model is from sociology and, although not flattering to our modern ego, provides an explanation to a puzzle that for many years has occupied those of us working on conversational user interfaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of enabling large language models (LLMs) to consistently adhere to emotional support strategies in extended conversations. We focus on the steerability of the Llama-2 and Llama-3 suite of models, examining their ability to maintain these strategies throughout interactions. To assess this, we introduce the Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA) metric, which quantifies the model's adherence to the prompted strategy through attention maps. To facilitate our study, we create a strategy-conditioned synthetic conversational dataset derived from the ESConv dataset. We also propose various baselines informed by our proposed SRA metric to address the challenge and propose a fine-tuned model that significantly enhances the steerability of the base model in following the strategy throughout the conversation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Patrick Xian, Alex J. Lee, Satvik Lolla, Vincent Wang, Qiming Cui, Russell Ro, Reza Abbasi-Asl</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing depth of parametric domain knowledge in large language models (LLMs) is fueling their rapid deployment in real-world applications. Understanding model vulnerabilities in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive tasks is essential for quantifying the trustworthiness of model predictions and regulating their use. The recent discovery of named entities as adversarial examples (i.e. adversarial entities) in natural language processing tasks raises questions about their potential impact on the knowledge robustness of pre-trained and finetuned LLMs in high-stakes and specialized domains. We examined the use of type-consistent entity substitution as a template for collecting adversarial entities for billion-parameter LLMs with biomedical knowledge. To this end, we developed an embedding-space attack based on powerscaled distance-weighted sampling to assess the robustness of their biomedical knowledge with a low query budget and controllable coverage. Our method has favorable query efficiency and scaling over alternative approaches based on random sampling and blackbox gradient-guided search, which we demonstrated for adversarial distractor generation in biomedical question answering. Subsequent failure mode analysis uncovered two regimes of adversarial entities on the attack surface with distinct characteristics and we showed that entity substitution attacks can manipulate token-wise Shapley value explanations, which become deceptive in this setting. Our approach complements standard evaluations for high-capacity models and the results highlight the brittleness of domain knowledge in LLMs.</p>

This survey leverages a unique taxonomy -- dividing puzzles into rule-based and rule-less categories -- to critically assess LLMs through various methodologies, including prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning. Through a critical review of relevant datasets and benchmarks, we assess LLMs' performance, identifying significant challenges in complex puzzle scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengrui Han, Rafal Kocielnik, Adhithya Saravanan, Roy Jiang, Or Sharir, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs), while powerful, exhibit harmful social biases. Debiasing is often challenging due to computational costs, data constraints, and potential degradation of multi-task language capabilities. This work introduces a novel approach utilizing ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data, aiming to enhance the debiasing of LLMs. We propose two strategies: Targeted Prompting, which provides effective debiasing for known biases but necessitates prior specification of bias in question; and General Prompting, which, while slightly less effective, offers debiasing across various categories. We leverage resource-efficient LLM debiasing using adapter tuning and compare the effectiveness of our synthetic data to existing debiasing datasets. Our results reveal that: (1) ChatGPT can efficiently produce high-quality training data for debiasing other LLMs; (2) data produced via our approach surpasses existing datasets in debiasing performance while also preserving internal knowledge of a pre-trained LLM; and (3) synthetic data exhibits generalizability across categories, effectively mitigating various biases, including intersectional ones. These findings underscore the potential of synthetic data in advancing the fairness of LLMs with minimal retraining cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xidong Wang, Nuo Chen, Junyin Chen, Yidong Wang, Guorui Zhen, Chunxian Zhang, Xiangbo Wu, Yan Hu, Anningzhe Gao, Xiang Wan, Haizhou Li, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the vast repository of global medical knowledge predominantly being in English, local languages are crucial for delivering tailored healthcare services, particularly in areas with limited medical resources. To extend the reach of medical AI advancements to a broader population, we aim to develop medical LLMs across the six most widely spoken languages, encompassing a global population of 6.1 billion. This effort culminates in the creation of the ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset and the XMedBench benchmark. In the multilingual medical benchmark, the released Apollo models, at various relatively-small sizes (i.e., 0.5B, 1.8B, 2B, 6B, and 7B), achieve the best performance among models of equivalent size. Especially, Apollo-7B is the state-of-the-art multilingual medical LLMs up to 70B. Additionally, these lite models could be used to improve the multi-lingual medical capabilities of larger models without fine-tuning in a proxy-tuning fashion. We will open-source training corpora, code, model weights and evaluation benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiying Zhu, Yiming Yang, Zhiqing Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in critical domains. Recent benchmarks designed to assess LLM hallucinations within conventional NLP tasks, such as knowledge-intensive question answering (QA) and summarization, are insufficient for capturing the complexities of user-LLM interactions in dynamic, real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce HaluEval-Wild, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM hallucinations in the wild. We meticulously collect challenging (adversarially filtered by Alpaca) user queries from ShareGPT, an existing real-world user-LLM interaction datasets, to evaluate the hallucination rates of various LLMs. Upon analyzing the collected queries, we categorize them into five distinct types, which enables a fine-grained analysis of the types of hallucinations LLMs exhibit, and synthesize the reference answers with the powerful GPT-4 model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our benchmark offers a novel approach towards enhancing our comprehension of and improving LLM reliability in scenarios reflective of real-world interactions. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/HaluEval-Wild/HaluEval-Wild.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qibing Ren, Chang Gao, Jing Shao, Junchi Yan, Xin Tan, Wai Lam, Lizhuang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable generative capabilities but also raised concerns about their potential misuse. While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a new and universal safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80\% of the time. We find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures. Furthermore, we give our hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk. Finally, we analyze potential mitigation measures. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Wu, Tianwei Yue, Shaokun Zhang, Chi Wang, Qingyun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is a notable trend to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks, e.g., tasks that require a sequence of actions and dynamic interaction with tools and external environments. In this paper, we propose StateFlow, a novel LLM-based task-solving paradigm that conceptualizes complex task-solving processes as state machines. In StateFlow, we distinguish between "process grounding" (via state and state transitions) and "sub-task solving" (through actions within a state), enhancing control and interpretability of the task-solving procedure. A state represents the status of a running process. The transitions between states are controlled by heuristic rules or decisions made by the LLM, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive progression. Upon entering a state, a series of actions is executed, involving not only calling LLMs guided by different prompts, but also the utilization of external tools as needed. Our results show that StateFlow significantly enhances LLMs' efficiency. For instance, StateFlow achieves 13% and 28% higher success rates compared to ReAct in InterCode SQL and ALFWorld benchmark, with 5x and 3x less cost respectively. We also show that StateFlow can be combined with iterative refining methods like Reflexion to further improve performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmeng Huang, Shuo Li, Mengxin Yu, Matteo Sesia, Hamed Hassani, Insup Lee, Osbert Bastani, Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have shown promising performance in natural language generation. However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses, it is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given inputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many uncertainty measures ($e.g.$, semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based measures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges ($e.g.$, $[0,\infty)$ or $[0,1]$). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed $Rank$-$Calibration$, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the correctness score ($e.g.$, ROUGE or METEOR). The broad applicability and the granular interpretability of our methods are demonstrated empirically.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</p>

Additionally, to compliment our audit, we conduct a survey with 171 practitioners from the field of NLP and AI to capture varying perspectives on hallucination. Our analysis calls for the necessity of explicit definitions and frameworks outlining hallucination within NLP, highlighting potential challenges, and our survey inputs provide a thematic understanding of the influence and ramifications of hallucination in society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Zhang, Chunliu Wang, Rik van Noord, Johan Bos</p>
<p>Abstract: The Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB) serves as a corpus for semantic processing with a focus on semantic parsing and text generation. Currently, we witness an excellent performance of neural parsers and generators on the PMB. This might suggest that such semantic processing tasks have by and large been solved. We argue that this is not the case and that performance scores from the past on the PMB are inflated by non-optimal data splits and test sets that are too easy. In response, we introduce several changes. First, instead of the prior random split, we propose a more systematic splitting approach to improve the reliability of the standard test data. Second, except for the standard test set, we also propose two challenge sets: one with longer texts including discourse structure, and one that addresses compositional generalization. We evaluate five neural models for semantic parsing and meaning-to-text generation. Our results show that model performance declines (in some cases dramatically) on the challenge sets, revealing the limitations of neural models when confronting such challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jumbly Grindrod</p>
<p>Abstract: Do large language models like Chat-GPT or LLaMa meaningfully use the words they produce? Or are they merely clever prediction machines, simulating language use by producing statistically plausible text? There have already been some initial attempts to answer this question by showing that these models meet the criteria for entering meaningful states according to metasemantic theories of mental content. In this paper, I will argue for a different approach - that we should instead consider whether language models meet the criteria given by our best metasemantic theories of linguistic content. In that vein, I will illustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of language models: Gareth Evans' (1982) account of naming practices and Ruth Millikan's (1984, 2004, 2005) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality - dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system - allows for the plausible result LLM outputs are meaningful.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, increasing research interests have focused on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucination for large language models (LLMs). Following this trend, we launch the FutureDial-RAG challenge at SLT 2024, which aims at promoting the study of RAG for dialog systems. The challenge builds upon the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service datasets with nearly 3000 high-quality dialogs containing annotations for knowledge base query and corresponding results. Over the dataset, we define two tasks, track 1 for knowledge retrieval and track 2 for response generation, which are core research questions in dialog systems with RAG. We build baseline systems for the two tracks and design metrics to measure whether the systems can perform accurate retrieval and generate informative and coherent response. The baseline results show that it is very challenging to perform well on the two tasks, which encourages the participating teams and the community to study how to make better use of RAG for real-life dialog systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaochen Gao, Xing Wu, Qi Fu, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models, initially pre-trained with a limited context length, can better handle longer texts by continuing training on a corpus with extended contexts. However, obtaining effective long-context data is challenging due to the scarcity and uneven distribution of long documents across different domains. To address this issue, we propose a Query-centric data synthesis method, abbreviated as Quest. Quest is an interpretable method based on the observation that documents retrieved by similar queries are relevant but low-redundant, thus well-suited for synthesizing long-context data. The method is also scalable and capable of constructing large amounts of long-context data. Using Quest, we synthesize a long-context dataset up to 128k context length, significantly outperforming other data synthesis methods on multiple long-context benchmark datasets. In addition, we further verify that the Quest method is predictable through scaling law experiments, making it a reliable solution for advancing long-context models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This research explores how the information of prompts interacts with the high-performing speech recognition model, Whisper. We compare its performances when prompted by prompts with correct information and those corrupted with incorrect information. Our results unexpectedly show that Whisper may not understand the textual prompts in a human-expected way. Additionally, we find that performance improvement is not guaranteed even with stronger adherence to the topic information in textual prompts. It is also noted that English prompts generally outperform Mandarin ones on datasets of both languages, likely due to differences in training data distributions for these languages despite the mismatch with pre-training scenarios. Conversely, we discover that Whisper exhibits awareness of misleading information in language tokens by ignoring incorrect language tokens and focusing on the correct ones. In sum, We raise insightful questions about Whisper's prompt understanding and reveal its counter-intuitive behaviors. We encourage further studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a large-scale study of linguistic bias exhibited by ChatGPT covering ten dialects of English (Standard American English, Standard British English, and eight widely spoken non-"standard" varieties from around the world). We prompted GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text by native speakers of each variety and analyzed the responses via detailed linguistic feature annotation and native speaker evaluation. We find that the models default to "standard" varieties of English; based on evaluation by native speakers, we also find that model responses to non-"standard" varieties consistently exhibit a range of issues: stereotyping (19% worse than for "standard" varieties), demeaning content (25% worse), lack of comprehension (9% worse), and condescending responses (15% worse). We also find that if these models are asked to imitate the writing style of prompts in non-"standard" varieties, they produce text that exhibits lower comprehension of the input and is especially prone to stereotyping. GPT-4 improves on GPT-3.5 in terms of comprehension, warmth, and friendliness, but also exhibits a marked increase in stereotyping (+18%). The results indicate that GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 can perpetuate linguistic discrimination toward speakers of non-"standard" varieties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atsuki Yamaguchi, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in many languages beyond English. Yet, LLMs require more inference steps when generating non-English text due to their reliance on English-centric tokenizers and vocabulary, resulting in higher usage costs to non-English speakers. Vocabulary expansion with target language tokens is a widely used cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation approach to remedy this issue. Despite its effectiveness in inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on high-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target language data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and adapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this paper, we investigate vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding initialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we establish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster inference, maintaining competitive downstream performance to baselines with only 30K sentences ($\sim$0.01GB text data) from the target language.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks present a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the intensive knowledge required. Current solutions, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, typically retrieve potential documents from an external corpus to read an answer. However, the performance of this retrieve-then-read paradigm is constrained by the retriever and the inevitable noise in the retrieved documents. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel generate-then-ground (GenGround) framework, synergizing the parametric knowledge of LLMs and external documents to solve a multi-hop question. GenGround empowers LLMs to alternate two phases until the final answer is derived: (1) formulate a simpler, single-hop question and directly generate the answer; (2) ground the question-answer pair in retrieved documents, amending any wrong predictions in the answer. We also propose an instructional grounding distillation method to generalize our method into smaller models. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets illustrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model unlearning has garnered increasing attention due to its potential to address security and privacy concerns, leading to extensive research in the field. However, much of this research has concentrated on instance-level unlearning, specifically targeting the removal of predefined instances containing sensitive content. This focus has left a significant gap in the exploration of full entity-level unlearning, which is critical in real-world scenarios such as copyright protection. To this end, we propose a novel task of Entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase entity-related knowledge from the target model completely. To thoroughly investigate this task, we systematically evaluate trending unlearning algorithms, revealing that current methods struggle to achieve effective entity-level unlearning. Then, we further explore the factors that influence the performance of the unlearning algorithms, identifying that knowledge coverage and the size of the forget set play pivotal roles. Notably, our analysis also uncovers that entities introduced through fine-tuning are more vulnerable to unlearning than pre-trained entities. These findings collectively offer valuable insights for advancing entity-level unlearning for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Ashkinaze, Ruijia Guan, Laura Kurek, Eytan Adar, Ceren Budak, Eric Gilbert</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on broad corpora and then used in communities with specialized norms. Is providing LLMs with community rules enough for models to follow these norms? We evaluate LLMs' capacity to detect (Task 1) and correct (Task 2) biased Wikipedia edits according to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy. LLMs struggled with bias detection, achieving only 64% accuracy on a balanced dataset. Models exhibited contrasting biases (some under- and others over-predicted bias), suggesting distinct priors about neutrality. LLMs performed better at generation, removing 79% of words removed by Wikipedia editors. However, LLMs made additional changes beyond Wikipedia editors' simpler neutralizations, resulting in high-recall but low-precision editing. Interestingly, crowdworkers rated AI rewrites as more neutral (70%) and fluent (61%) than Wikipedia-editor rewrites. Qualitative analysis found LLMs sometimes applied NPOV more comprehensively than Wikipedia editors but often made extraneous non-NPOV-related changes (such as grammar). LLMs may apply rules in ways that resonate with the public but diverge from community experts. While potentially effective for generation, LLMs may reduce editor agency and increase moderation workload (e.g., verifying additions). Even when rules are easy to articulate, having LLMs apply them like community members may still be difficult.</p>

In this work, we aim to address this issue by exploring techniques to minimize the size of PLM-based intent detectors trained with few-shot data. Specifically, we utilize large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation, employ a cutting-edge model compression method for knowledge distillation, and devise a vocabulary pruning mechanism called V-Prune. Through these approaches, we successfully achieve a compression ratio of 21 in model memory usage, including both Transformer and the vocabulary, while maintaining almost identical performance levels on four real-world benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language.

Additionally, we introduce the Name-Aware Unlearning Framework (NAUF) for Privacy Protection, which enables the model to learn which individuals' information should be protected without affecting its ability to answer questions related to other unrelated individuals. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NAUF achieves a state-of-the-art average unlearning score, surpassing the best baseline method by 5.65 points, effectively protecting target individuals' personal data while maintaining the model's general capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of medical diagnosis has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of large language models (LLMs), yet the challenges of interpretability within these models remain largely unaddressed. This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of LLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic benchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring controllability in diagnostic rigor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao-Shun Chuang, Atiquer Rahman Sarkar, Yu-Chun Hsu, Noman Mohammed, Xiaoqian Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines integrating EHRs and NLP with large language models (LLMs) to improve healthcare data management and patient care. It focuses on using advanced models to create secure, HIPAA-compliant synthetic patient notes for biomedical research. The study used de-identified and re-identified MIMIC III datasets with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 7B to generate synthetic notes. Text generation employed templates and keyword extraction for contextually relevant notes, with one-shot generation for comparison. Privacy assessment checked PHI occurrence, while text utility was tested using an ICD-9 coding task. Text quality was evaluated with ROUGE and cosine similarity metrics to measure semantic similarity with source notes. Analysis of PHI occurrence and text utility via the ICD-9 coding task showed that the keyword-based method had low risk and good performance. One-shot generation showed the highest PHI exposure and PHI co-occurrence, especially in geographic location and date categories. The Normalized One-shot method achieved the highest classification accuracy. Privacy analysis revealed a critical balance between data utility and privacy protection, influencing future data use and sharing. Re-identified data consistently outperformed de-identified data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of keyword-based methods in generating privacy-protecting synthetic clinical notes that retain data usability, potentially transforming clinical data-sharing practices. The superior performance of re-identified over de-identified data suggests a shift towards methods that enhance utility and privacy by using dummy PHIs to perplex privacy attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Matkin, Aleksei Smirnov, Mikhail Usanin, Egor Ivanov, Kirill Sobyanin, Sofiia Paklina, Petr Parshakov</p>
<p>Abstract: The labor market is undergoing rapid changes, with increasing demands on job seekers and a surge in job openings. Identifying essential skills and competencies from job descriptions is challenging due to varying employer requirements and the omission of key skills. This study addresses these challenges by comparing traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods based on encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting skills from Russian job vacancies. Using a labeled dataset of 4,000 job vacancies for training and 1,472 for testing, the performance of both approaches is evaluated. Results indicate that traditional NER models, especially DeepPavlov RuBERT NER tuned, outperform LLMs across various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and inference time. The findings suggest that traditional NER models provide more effective and efficient solutions for skill extraction, enhancing job requirement clarity and aiding job seekers in aligning their qualifications with employer expectations. This research contributes to the field of natural language processing (NLP) and its application in the labor market, particularly in non-English contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivo Lodovico Molina, Valdemar \v{S}v\'abensk\'y, Tsubasa Minematsu, Li Chen, Fumiya Okubo, Atsushi Shimada</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Question Generation in educational settings. Three LLMs are compared in their ability to create questions from university slide text without fine-tuning. Questions were obtained in a two-step pipeline: first, answer phrases were extracted from slides using Llama 2-Chat 13B; then, the three models generated questions for each answer. To analyze whether the questions would be suitable in educational applications for students, a survey was conducted with 46 students who evaluated a total of 246 questions across five metrics: clarity, relevance, difficulty, slide relation, and question-answer alignment. Results indicate that GPT-3.5 and Llama 2-Chat 13B outperform Flan T5 XXL by a small margin, particularly in terms of clarity and question-answer alignment. GPT-3.5 especially excels at tailoring questions to match the input answers. The contribution of this research is the analysis of the capacity of LLMs for Automatic Question Generation in education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance performance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of these models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to investigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models with varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and AdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial samples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE tasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative robustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack levels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to achieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource constraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Cheng, Ke Sun, Xinyu Zhang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges. Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data. This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks. Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q. Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames. Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs. These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Wu, Ming Shan Hee, Zhiqing Hu, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In evaluating the long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), benchmarks such as "Needle-in-a-Haystack" (NIAH), Ruler, and Needlebench are commonly used. While these benchmarks measure how well models understand long-context input sequences, they do not effectively gauge the quality of long-form text generation--a critical aspect for applications such as design proposals and creative writing. To address this gap, we have introduced a new long-form text evaluation benchmark, LongGenBench, which tests models' ability to identify specific events within generated long text sequences. In this benchmark, we prompt long-context LMs to create long-form text that must include particular events or constraints and evaluate their ability to incorporate these elements. We evaluated ten long-context LMs across four distinct scenarios, three types of prompt instructions, and two different generation-length settings (16K and 32K). Although these models perform well on NIAH benchmarks, none demonstrated satisfactory performance on the LongGenBench, raising concerns about their ability to generate coherent long-form text that follows instructions. Additionally, as the length of the generated text increases, all models exhibit a significant drop in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yicheng Fu, Raviteja Anantha, Prabal Vashisht, Jianpeng Cheng, Etai Littwin</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating user intent from a sequence of user interface (UI) actions is a core challenge in comprehensive UI understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in this area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power, and high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight, on-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight models. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that employs masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for user intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal datasets, "Intent in the Wild" (IIW) and "Intent in the Tame" (IIT), designed for few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos across 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10 categories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that representations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM decoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of state-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and deployment resources. Measured by intent similarity scores, UI-JEPA outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 10.0% and 7.2% respectively, averaged across two datasets. Notably, UI-JEPA accomplishes the performance with a 50.5x reduction in computational cost and a 6.6x improvement in latency in the IIW dataset. These results underscore the effectiveness of UI-JEPA, highlighting its potential for lightweight, high-performance UI understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine translation using large language models (LLMs) is having a significant global impact, making communication easier. Mandarin Chinese is the official language used for communication by the government and media in China. In this study, we provide an automated assessment of translation quality of Google Translate with human experts using sentiment and semantic analysis. In order to demonstrate our framework, we select the classic early twentieth-century novel 'The True Story of Ah Q' with selected Mandarin Chinese to English translations. We use Google Translate to translate the given text into English and then conduct a chapter-wise sentiment analysis and semantic analysis to compare the extracted sentiments across the different translations. Our results indicate that the precision of Google Translate differs both in terms of semantic and sentiment analysis when compared to human expert translations. We find that Google Translate is unable to translate some of the specific words or phrases in Chinese, such as Chinese traditional allusions. The mistranslations may be due to lack of contextual significance and historical knowledge of China.</p>

<p>Abstract: While measuring bias and robustness in coreference resolution are important goals, such measurements are only as good as the tools we use to measure them with. Winogender schemas (Rudinger et al., 2018) are an influential dataset proposed to evaluate gender bias in coreference resolution, but a closer look reveals issues with the data that compromise its use for reliable evaluation, including treating different pronominal forms as equivalent, violations of template constraints, and typographical errors. We identify these issues and fix them, contributing a new dataset: WinoPron. Our changes affect performance with state-of-the-art supervised coreference resolution systems as well as all model sizes of the language model FLAN-T5, with F1 dropping on average 10 percentage points. We also propose a new method to evaluate pronominal bias in coreference resolution that goes beyond the binary. With this method and our new dataset which is balanced for grammatical case, we empirically demonstrate that bias characteristics vary not just across pronoun sets, but also across surface forms of those sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements with increasing demands in various fields (e.g., multimodal agents, embodied intelligence). While model-driven approaches attempt to enhance MLLMs capabilities through diverse architectures, the gains have become increasingly marginal. Conversely, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction data, are more effective but face limited data diversity and complexity challenges. The absence of high-quality data constitutes a significant development barrier for MLLMs. To address the data quality bottleneck, we propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively improve data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broaden the diversity of instruction types, extend visual reasoning steps to improve cognitive reasoning abilities, and thoroughly explore fine-grained information within images to enhance visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to baseline models trained with the initial seed data, the results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Furthermore, our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in nine tasks using significantly less data compared to state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce ClarQ-LLM, an evaluation framework consisting of bilingual English-Chinese conversation tasks, conversational agents and evaluation metrics, designed to serve as a strong benchmark for assessing agents' ability to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues. The benchmark includes 31 different task types, each with 10 unique dialogue scenarios between information seeker and provider agents. The scenarios require the seeker to ask questions to resolve uncertainty and gather necessary information to complete tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks that evaluate agents based on fixed dialogue content, ClarQ-LLM includes a provider conversational agent to replicate the original human provider in the benchmark. This allows both current and future seeker agents to test their ability to complete information gathering tasks through dialogue by directly interacting with our provider agent. In tests, LLAMA3.1 405B seeker agent managed a maximum success rate of only 60.05\%, showing that ClarQ-LLM presents a strong challenge for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal misinformation on online social platforms is becoming a critical concern due to increasing credibility and easier dissemination brought by multimedia content, compared to traditional text-only information. While existing multimodal detection approaches have achieved high performance, the lack of interpretability hinders these systems' reliability and practical deployment. Inspired by NeuralSymbolic AI which combines the learning ability of neural networks with the explainability of symbolic learning, we propose a novel logic-based neural model for multimodal misinformation detection which integrates interpretable logic clauses to express the reasoning process of the target task. To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations. Results on three public datasets (Twitter, Weibo, and Sarcasm) demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoshi Ling, Guoli Ye, Rui Zhao, Yifan Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: The attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) speech recognition model has been widely successful in recent years. However, the joint optimization of acoustic model and language model in end-to-end manner has created challenges for text adaptation. In particular, effective, quick and inexpensive adaptation with text input has become a primary concern for deploying AED systems in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, the hybrid attention-based encoder-decoder (HAED) speech recognition model that preserves the modularity of conventional hybrid automatic speech recognition systems. Our HAED model separates the acoustic and language models, allowing for the use of conventional text-based language model adaptation techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed HAED model yields 23% relative Word Error Rate (WER) improvements when out-of-domain text data is used for language model adaptation, with only a minor degradation in WER on a general test set compared with the conventional AED model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuchen Long, Zhaofan Qiu, Ting Yao, Tao Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have significantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for the given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with only one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate multi-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely manage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance of key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely VideoStudio, for consistent-content and multi-scene video generation. Technically, VideoStudio leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to convert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits from the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a prompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as camera movement. VideoStudio identifies the common entities throughout the script and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is then fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each entity. Finally, VideoStudio outputs a multi-scene video by generating each scene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the descriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion model incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to strengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoStudio outperforms the SOTA video generation models in terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Rodionov, Liudmila Prokhorenkova</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to capture computations with neural networks via learning the models to imitate the execution of classic algorithms. While common architectures are expressive enough to contain the correct model in the weights space, current neural reasoners are struggling to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, classic computations are not affected by distributional shifts as they can be described as transitions between discrete computational states. In this work, we propose to force neural reasoners to maintain the execution trajectory as a combination of finite predefined states. To achieve that, we separate discrete and continuous data flows and describe the interaction between them. Trained with supervision on the algorithm's state transitions, such models are able to perfectly align with the original algorithm. To show this, we evaluate our approach on multiple algorithmic problems and get perfect test scores both in single-task and multitask setups. Moreover, the proposed architectural choice allows us to prove the correctness of the learned algorithms for any test~data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinfeng Li, Yuchen Yang, Jiangyi Deng, Chen Yan, Yanjiao Chen, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexually explicit scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block sexually explicit content (e.g., naked) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts -- inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate sexual content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate explicit visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since such unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets and large-scale user studies demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating sexually explicit content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.4% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Javadian Sabet, Sarah H. Bana, Renzhe Yu, Morgan R. Frank</p>
<p>Abstract: Higher education plays a critical role in driving an innovative economy by equipping students with knowledge and skills demanded by the workforce. While researchers and practitioners have developed data systems to track detailed occupational skills, such as those established by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), much less effort has been made to document which of these skills are being developed in higher education at a similar granularity. Here, we fill this gap by presenting Course-Skill Atlas -- a longitudinal dataset of skills inferred from over three million course syllabi taught at nearly three thousand U.S. higher education institutions. To construct Course-Skill Atlas, we apply natural language processing to quantify the alignment between course syllabi and detailed workplace activities (DWAs) used by the DOL to describe occupations. We then aggregate these alignment scores to create skill profiles for institutions and academic majors. Our dataset offers a large-scale representation of college education's role in preparing students for the labor market. Overall, Course-Skill Atlas can enable new research on the source of skills in the context of workforce development and provide actionable insights for shaping the future of higher education to meet evolving labor demands, especially in the face of new technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinmeng Huang, Shuo Li, Edgar Dobriban, Osbert Bastani, Hamed Hassani, Dongsheng Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing safety concerns surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) raise an urgent need to align them with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their helpfulness and safety. A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, common Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a dualization perspective that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, thus greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based scenarios (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Efstathiadis, Vijay Yadav, Anzar Abbas</p>
<p>Abstract: Speaker diarization is necessary for interpreting conversations transcribed using automated speech recognition (ASR) tools. Despite significant developments in diarization methods, diarization accuracy remains an issue. Here, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for diarization correction as a post-processing step. LLMs were fine-tuned using the Fisher corpus, a large dataset of transcribed conversations. The ability of the models to improve diarization accuracy in a holdout dataset from the Fisher corpus as well as an independent dataset was measured. We report that fine-tuned LLMs can markedly improve diarization accuracy. However, model performance is constrained to transcripts produced using the same ASR tool as the transcripts used for fine-tuning, limiting generalizability. To address this constraint, an ensemble model was developed by combining weights from three separate models, each fine-tuned using transcripts from a different ASR tool. The ensemble model demonstrated better overall performance than each of the ASR-specific models, suggesting that a generalizable and ASR-agnostic approach may be achievable. We have made the weights of these models publicly available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/bklynhlth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avital Shafran, Roei Schuster, Vitaly Shmatikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems respond to queries by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge database, then generating an answer by applying an LLM to the retrieved documents. We demonstrate that RAG systems that operate on databases with untrusted content are vulnerable to a new class of denial-of-service attacks we call jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG system not answering this query - ostensibly because it lacks the information or because the answer is unsafe.
  We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. This method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3) does not use an auxiliary LLM to generate blocker documents.
  We evaluate jamming attacks on several LLMs and embeddings and demonstrate that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhrij Patel, Vishnu Sashank Dorbala, Amrit Singh Bedi, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an important problem, which involves an agent exploring the environment to answer user queries. In the existing literature, EQA has exclusively been studied in single-agent scenarios, where exploration can be time-consuming and costly. In this work, we consider EQA in a multi-agent framework involving multiple large language models (LLM) based agents independently answering queries about a household environment. To generate one answer for each query, we use the individual responses to train a Central Answer Model (CAM) that aggregates responses for a robust answer. While prior Question Answering (QA) work has used a central module based on answers from multiple LLM-based experts, we specifically look at applying this framework to embodied LLM-based agents that must physically explore the environment first to become experts on their given environment to answer questions. Our work is the first to utilize a central answer model framework with embodied agents that must rely on exploring an unknown environment. We set up a variation of EQA where instead of the agents exploring the environment after the question is asked, the agents first explore the environment for a set amount of time and then answer a set of queries. Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher EQA accuracy when compared against aggregation methods for ensemble LLM, such as voting schemes and debates. CAM does not require any form of agent communication, alleviating it from the associated costs. We ablate CAM with various nonlinear (neural network, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost) and linear (logistic regression classifier, SVM) algorithms. We experiment in various topological graph environments and examine the case where one of the agents is malicious and purposes contribute responses it believes to be wrong.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sedigheh Eslami, Gerard de Melo</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Language--Image Pre-training (CLIP) has manifested remarkable improvements in zero-shot classification and cross-modal vision-language tasks. Yet, from a geometrical point of view, the CLIP embedding space has been found to have a pronounced modality gap. This gap renders the embedding space overly sparse and disconnected, with different modalities being densely distributed in distinct subregions of the hypersphere. In this work, we aim at answering three main questions: 1. Does sharing the parameter space between the multi-modal encoders reduce the modality gap? 2. Can the gap be mitigated by pushing apart the uni-modal embeddings via intra-modality separation? 3. How do these gap reduction approaches affect the downstream performance? We design AlignCLIP, in order to answer these questions and through extensive experiments, we show that AlignCLIP achieves noticeable enhancements in the cross-modal alignment of the embeddings, and thereby, reduces the modality gap, while improving the performance across several zero-shot and fine-tuning downstream evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junying Chen, Chi Gui, Ruyi Ouyang, Anningzhe Gao, Shunian Chen, Guiming Hardy Chen, Xidong Wang, Ruifei Zhang, Zhenyang Cai, Ke Ji, Guangjun Yu, Xiang Wan, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungnyun Kim, Kangwook Jang, Sangmin Bae, Hoirin Kim, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) aims to transcribe human speech using both audio and video modalities. In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukuan Dong, Donghong Qin, Fengbo Bai, Fanhua Song, Yan Liu, Chen Xu, Zhijian Ou</p>
<p>Abstract: The mainstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology usually requires hundreds to thousands of hours of annotated speech data. Three approaches to low-resourced ASR are phoneme or subword based supervised pre-training, and self-supervised pre-training over multilingual data. The Iu Mien language is the main ethnic language of the Yao ethnic group in China and is low-resourced in the sense that the annotated speech is very limited. With less than 10 hours of transcribed Iu Mien language, this paper investigates and compares the three approaches for Iu Mien speech recognition. Our experiments are based on the recently released, three backbone models pretrained over the 10 languages from the CommonVoice dataset (CV-Lang10), which correspond to the three approaches for low-resourced ASR. It is found that phoneme supervision can achieve better results compared to subword supervision and self-supervision, thereby providing higher data-efficiency. Particularly, the Whistle models, i.e., obtained by the weakly-supervised phoneme-based multilingual pre-training, obtain the most competitive results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Junzhe Yu, Huijia Sun, Ling Shi, Gelei Deng, Yuqi Chen, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have completely transformed the domain of computational pathology (CPath), which in turn altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. FMs overcome the limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath by learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language to be used as a rich semantic information source to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and the way it is going to be transformed through FMs and VLMs in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for the automation of scientific research, spanning both experimental processes and computational simulations. This study explores the feasibility of constructing an autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM, through sophisticated API integration, to automate the entire research process, from experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation. Using a simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a case study, we assessed the performance of ASAs powered by different LLMs including GPT-4-Turbo. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless execution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of LLMs to manage complete scientific investigations autonomously. The outlined automation can be iteratively performed up to twenty cycles without human intervention, illustrating the potential of LLMs for large-scale autonomous research endeavors. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASAs in managing extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms and the balance between local attention and global oversight.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech dysfluency modeling is the core module for spoken language learning, and speech therapy. However, there are three challenges. First, current state-of-the-art solutions suffer from poor scalability. Second, there is a lack of a large-scale dysfluency corpus. Third, there is not an effective learning framework. In this paper, we propose \textit{SSDM: Scalable Speech Dysfluency Modeling}, which (1) adopts articulatory gestures as scalable forced alignment; (2) introduces connectionist subsequence aligner (CSA) to achieve dysfluency alignment; (3) introduces a large-scale simulated dysfluency corpus called Libri-Dys; and (4) develops an end-to-end system by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). We expect SSDM to serve as a standard in the area of dysfluency modeling. Demo is available at \url{https://eureka235.github.io}.</p>

To help answer these questions, we introduce the problem of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context (if any) that led a model to generate a particular statement. We then present ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution that can be applied on top of any existing language model. Finally, we showcase the utility of ContextCite through three applications: (1) helping verify generated statements (2) improving response quality by pruning the context and (3) detecting poisoning attacks. We provide code for ContextCite at https://github.com/MadryLab/context-cite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William English, Dominic Simon, Sumit Jha, Rickard Ewetz</p>
<p>Abstract: Path planners that can interpret free-form natural language instructions hold promise to automate a wide range of robotics applications. These planners simplify user interactions and enable intuitive control over complex semi-autonomous systems. While existing symbolic approaches offer guarantees on the correctness and efficiency, they struggle to parse free-form natural language inputs. Conversely, neural approaches based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can manage natural language inputs but lack performance guarantees. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework for path planning from natural language inputs called NSP. The framework leverages the neural reasoning abilities of LLMs to i) craft symbolic representations of the environment and ii) a symbolic path planning algorithm. Next, a solution to the path planning problem is obtained by executing the algorithm on the environment representation. The framework uses a feedback loop from the symbolic execution environment to the neural generation process to self-correct syntax errors and satisfy execution time constraints. We evaluate our neuro-symbolic approach using a benchmark suite with 1500 path-planning problems. The experimental evaluation shows that our neuro-symbolic approach produces 90.1% valid paths that are on average 19-77% shorter than state-of-the-art neural approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakan T. Otal, M. Abdullah Canbaz</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of cyber threats necessitates innovative solutions for detecting and analyzing malicious activity. Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.</p>
