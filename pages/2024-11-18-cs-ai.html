<p><b>Authors:</b> Chin-Sung Tung, Sheng-Fu Liang, Shu-Feng Chang, Chung-Ping Young</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. However, small hospitals and clinics often lack advanced EEG signal analysis systems and are prone to misinterpretation in manual EEG reading. This study proposes an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) system for automatic interpretation of EEG background activity and report generation. The system combines deep learning models for posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) prediction, unsupervised artifact removal, and expert-designed algorithms for abnormality detection. For PDR prediction, 1530 labeled EEGs were used, and the best ensemble model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.237, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.359, an accuracy of 91.8% within a 0.6Hz error, and an accuracy of 99% within a 1.2Hz error. The AI system significantly outperformed neurologists in detecting generalized background slowing (p = 0.02; F1: AI 0.93, neurologists 0.82) and demonstrated improved focal abnormality detection, although not statistically significant (p = 0.79; F1: AI 0.71, neurologists 0.55). Validation on both an internal dataset and the Temple University Abnormal EEG Corpus showed consistent performance (F1: 0.884 and 0.835, respectively; p = 0.66), demonstrating generalizability. The use of large language models (LLMs) for report generation demonstrated 100% accuracy, verified by three other independent LLMs. This hybrid AI system provides an easily scalable and accurate solution for EEG interpretation in resource-limited settings, assisting neurologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing misdiagnosis rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janghwan Lee, Jiwoong Park, Jinseok Kim, Yongjik Kim, Jungju Oh, Jinwook Oh, Jungwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths has increased the need for efficient low-bit quantization to manage their substantial computational demands. However, reducing precision to 4 bits frequently degrades performance due to activation outliers. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Microscaling 4-bit Floating-Point (AMXFP4) for efficient LLM inference. This novel data format leverages asymmetric shared scales to mitigate outliers while naturally capturing the asymmetry introduced by group-wise quantization. Unlike conventional 4-bit quantization methods that rely on data rotation and costly calibration, AMXFP4 uses asymmetric shared scales for direct 4-bit casting, achieving near-ideal quantization accuracy across various LLM tasks, including multi-turn conversations, long-context reasoning, and visual question answering. Our AMXFP4 format significantly outperforms MXFP4 and other leading quantization techniques, enabling robust, calibration-free 4-bit inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rina Dechter, Annie Raichev, Alexander Ihler, Jin Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on the computational complexity of computing empirical plug-in estimates for causal effect queries. Given a causal graph and observational data, any identifiable causal query can be estimated from an expression over the observed variables, called the estimand. The estimand can then be evaluated by plugging in probabilities computed empirically from data. In contrast to conventional wisdom, which assumes that high dimensional probabilistic functions will lead to exponential evaluation time of the estimand. We show that computation can be done efficiently, potentially in time linear in the data size, depending on the estimand's hypergraph.
  In particular, we show that both the treewidth and hypertree width of the estimand's structure bound the evaluation complexity of the plug-in estimands, analogous to their role in the complexity of probabilistic inference in graphical models. Often, the hypertree width provides a more effective bound, since the empirical distributions are sparse.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Goldie, Azalia Mirhoseini, Jeff Dean</p>
<p>Abstract: In 2020, we introduced a deep reinforcement learning method capable of generating superhuman chip layouts, which we then published in Nature and open-sourced on GitHub. AlphaChip has inspired an explosion of work on AI for chip design, and has been deployed in state-of-the-art chips across Alphabet and extended by external chipmakers. Even so, a non-peer-reviewed invited paper at ISPD 2023 questioned its performance claims, despite failing to run our method as described in Nature. For example, it did not pre-train the RL method (removing its ability to learn from prior experience), used substantially fewer compute resources (20x fewer RL experience collectors and half as many GPUs), did not train to convergence (standard practice in machine learning), and evaluated on test cases that are not representative of modern chips. Recently, Igor Markov published a meta-analysis of three papers: our peer-reviewed Nature paper, the non-peer-reviewed ISPD paper, and Markov's own unpublished paper (though he does not disclose that he co-authored it). Although AlphaChip has already achieved widespread adoption and impact, we publish this response to ensure that no one is wrongly discouraged from innovating in this impactful area.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10063">Federated Domain Generalization via Prompt Learning and Aggregation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Gong, Chaoran Cui, Chunyun Zhang, Wenna Wang, Xiushan Nie, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to improve the global model generalization in unseen domains by addressing data heterogeneity under privacy-preserving constraints. A common strategy in existing FedDG studies involves sharing domain-specific knowledge among clients, such as spectrum information, class prototypes, and data styles. However, this knowledge is extracted directly from local client samples, and sharing such sensitive information poses a potential risk of data leakage, which might not fully meet the requirements of FedDG. In this paper, we introduce prompt learning to adapt pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in the FedDG scenario, and leverage locally learned prompts as a more secure bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer among clients. Specifically, we propose a novel FedDG framework through Prompt Learning and AggregatioN (PLAN), which comprises two training stages to collaboratively generate local prompts and global prompts at each federated round. First, each client performs both text and visual prompt learning using their own data, with local prompts indirectly synchronized by regarding the global prompts as a common reference. Second, all domain-specific local prompts are exchanged among clients and selectively aggregated into the global prompts using lightweight attention-based aggregators. The global prompts are finally applied to adapt VLMs to unseen target domains. As our PLAN framework requires training only a limited number of prompts and lightweight aggregators, it offers notable advantages in computational and communication efficiency for FedDG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization ability of PLAN across four benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emirhan B\"oge, Yasemin Gunindi, Erchan Aptoula, Nihan Alp, Huseyin Ozkan</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuron importance assessment is crucial for understanding the inner workings of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and improving their interpretability and efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach to neuron significance assessment inspired by frequency tagging, a technique from neuroscience. By applying sinusoidal contrast modulation to image inputs and analyzing resulting neuron activations, this method enables fine-grained analysis of a network's decision-making processes. Experiments conducted with a convolutional neural network for image classification reveal notable harmonics and intermodulations in neuron-specific responses under part-based frequency tagging. These findings suggest that ANNs exhibit behavior akin to biological brains in tuning to flickering frequencies, thereby opening avenues for neuron/filter importance assessment through frequency tagging. The proposed method holds promise for applications in network pruning, and model interpretability, contributing to the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence and addressing the lack of transparency in neural networks. Future research directions include developing novel loss functions to encourage biologically plausible behavior in ANNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joon Sung Park, Carolyn Q. Zou, Aaron Shaw, Benjamin Mako Hill, Carrie Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Robb Willer, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein</p>
<p>Abstract: The promise of human behavioral simulation--general-purpose computational agents that replicate human behavior across domains--could enable broad applications in policymaking and social science. We present a novel agent architecture that simulates the attitudes and behaviors of 1,052 real individuals--applying large language models to qualitative interviews about their lives, then measuring how well these agents replicate the attitudes and behaviors of the individuals that they represent. The generative agents replicate participants' responses on the General Social Survey 85% as accurately as participants replicate their own answers two weeks later, and perform comparably in predicting personality traits and outcomes in experimental replications. Our architecture reduces accuracy biases across racial and ideological groups compared to agents given demographic descriptions. This work provides a foundation for new tools that can help investigate individual and collective behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has explored the memorization capacity of multi-head attention, but these findings are constrained by unrealistic limitations on the context size. We present a novel proof for language-based Transformers that extends the current hypothesis to any context size. Our approach improves upon the state-of-the-art by achieving more effective exact memorization with an attention layer, while also introducing the concept of approximate memorization of distributions. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate that our proposed bounds more accurately reflect the true memorization capacity of language models, and provide a precise comparison with prior work.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the sycophancy problem caused by reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models, this research applies synthetic data intervention technology to the decoder-only transformer architecture. Based on the research gaps in the existing literature, the researcher designed an experimental process to reduce the tendency of models to cater by generating diversified data, and used GPT4o as an experimental tool for verification. The experiment used 100 true and false questions, and compared the performance of the model trained with synthetic data intervention and the original untrained model on multiple indicators. The results show that the SDI training model supports the technology in terms of accuracy rate and sycophancy rate and has significant effectiveness in reducing sycophancy phenomena.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saskia Redgate, Andrew M. Bean, Adam Mahdi</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have led to their use as substitutes for human feedback for training and assessing other LLMs. These methods often rely on `constitutions', written guidelines which a critic model uses to provide feedback and improve generations. We investigate how the choice of constitution affects feedback quality by using four different constitutions to improve patient-centered communication in medical interviews. In pairwise comparisons conducted by 215 human raters, we found that detailed constitutions led to better results regarding emotive qualities. However, none of the constitutions outperformed the baseline in learning more practically-oriented skills related to information gathering and provision. Our findings indicate that while detailed constitutions should be prioritised, there are possible limitations to the effectiveness of AI feedback as a reward signal in certain areas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rotem Ben Zion, Boaz Carmeli, Orr Paradise, Yonatan Belinkov</p>
<p>Abstract: When artificial agents are jointly trained to perform collaborative tasks using a communication channel, they develop opaque goal-oriented communication protocols. Good task performance is often considered sufficient evidence that meaningful communication is taking place, but existing empirical results show that communication strategies induced by common objectives can be counterintuitive whilst solving the task nearly perfectly. In this work, we identify a goal-agnostic prerequisite to meaningful communication, which we term semantic consistency, based on the idea that messages should have similar meanings across instances. We provide a formal definition for this idea, and use it to compare the two most common objectives in the field of emergent communication: discrimination and reconstruction. We prove, under mild assumptions, that semantically inconsistent communication protocols can be optimal solutions to the discrimination task, but not to reconstruction. We further show that the reconstruction objective encourages a stricter property, spatial meaningfulness, which also accounts for the distance between messages. Experiments with emergent communication games validate our theoretical results. These findings demonstrate an inherent advantage of distance-based communication goals, and contextualize previous empirical discoveries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Matarese, Francesco Rea, Katharina J. Rohlfing, Alessandra Sciutti</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative decision-making with artificial intelligence (AI) agents presents opportunities and challenges. While human-AI performance often surpasses that of individuals, the impact of such technology on human behavior remains insufficiently understood, primarily when AI agents can provide justifiable explanations for their suggestions. This study compares the effects of classic vs. partner-aware explanations on human behavior and performance during a learning-by-doing task. Three participant groups were involved: one interacting with a computer, another with a humanoid robot, and a third one without assistance. Results indicated that partner-aware explanations influenced participants differently based on the type of artificial agents involved. With the computer, participants enhanced their task completion times. At the same time, those interacting with the humanoid robot were more inclined to follow its suggestions, although they did not reduce their timing. Interestingly, participants autonomously performing the learning-by-doing task demonstrated superior knowledge acquisition than those assisted by explainable AI (XAI). These findings raise profound questions and have significant implications for automated tutoring and human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valeria Jannelli, Stefan Schoepf, Matthias Bickel, Torbj{\o}rn Netland, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate consensus-seeking in supply chain management (SCM), where frequent decisions on problems such as inventory levels and delivery times require coordination among companies. Traditional SCM relies on human consensus in decision-making to avoid emergent problems like the bullwhip effect. Some routine consensus processes, especially those that are time-intensive and costly, can be automated. Existing solutions for automated coordination have faced challenges due to high entry barriers locking out SMEs, limited capabilities, and limited adaptability in complex scenarios. However, recent advances in Generative AI, particularly LLMs, show promise in overcoming these barriers. LLMs, trained on vast datasets can negotiate, reason, and plan, facilitating near-human-level consensus at scale with minimal entry barriers. In this work, we identify key limitations in existing approaches and propose autonomous LLM agents to address these gaps. We introduce a series of novel, supply chain-specific consensus-seeking frameworks tailored for LLM agents and validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in inventory management. To accelerate progress within the SCM community, we open-source our code, providing a foundation for further advancements in LLM-powered autonomous supply chain solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nico Roos</p>
<p>Abstract: In many situations humans have to reason with inconsistent knowledge. These inconsistencies may occur due to not fully reliable sources of information. In order to reason with inconsistent knowledge, it is not possible to view a set of premisses as absolute truths as is done in predicate logic. Viewing the set of premisses as a set of assumptions, however, it is possible to deduce useful conclusions from an inconsistent set of premisses. In this paper a logic for reasoning with inconsistent knowledge is described. This logic is a generalization of the work of N. Rescher [15]. In the logic a reliability relation is used to choose between incompatible assumptions. These choices are only made when a contradiction is derived. As long as no contradiction is derived, the knowledge is assumed to be consistent. This makes it possible to define an argumentation-based deduction process for the logic. For the logic a semantics based on the ideas of Y. Shoham [22, 23], is defined. It turns out that the semantics for the logic is a preferential semantics according to the definition S. Kraus, D. Lehmann and M. Magidor [12]. Therefore the logic is a logic of system P and possesses all the properties of an ideal non-monotonic logic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Yaseen Jabarulla, Theodor Uden, Thomas Jack, Philipp Beerbaum, Steffen Oeltze-Jafra</p>
<p>Abstract: Pediatric heart diseases present a broad spectrum of congenital and acquired diseases. More complex congenital malformations require a differentiated and multimodal decision-making process, usually including echocardiography as a central imaging method. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers considerable promise for clinicians by facilitating automated interpretation of pediatric echocardiography data. However, adapting AI technologies for pediatric echocardiography analysis has challenges such as limited public data availability, data privacy, and AI model transparency. Recently, researchers have focused on disruptive technologies, such as federated learning (FL) and explainable AI (XAI), to improve automatic diagnostic and decision support workflows. This study offers a comprehensive overview of the limitations and opportunities of AI in pediatric echocardiography, emphasizing the synergistic workflow and role of XAI and FL, identifying research gaps, and exploring potential future developments. Additionally, three relevant clinical use cases demonstrate the functionality of XAI and FL with a focus on (i) view recognition, (ii) disease classification, (iii) segmentation of cardiac structures, and (iv) quantitative assessment of cardiac function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Jing Zhang, Xiaokang Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture are widely employed across various domains and tasks. However, their increasing size imposes significant hardware demands, limiting practical deployment. To mitigate this, model pruning techniques have been developed to create more efficient models while maintaining high performance. Despite this, post-training after pruning is crucial for performance recovery and can be resource-intensive. This paper investigates the post-training requirements of pruned LLMs and introduces a scaling law to determine the optimal amount of post-training data. Post-training experiments with the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using depth pruning, width pruning, and 2:4 semi-structured pruning, show that higher pruning ratios necessitate more post-training data for performance recovery, whereas larger LLMs require less. The proposed scaling law predicts a model's loss based on its parameter counts before and after pruning, as well as the post-training token counts. Furthermore, we find that the scaling law established from smaller LLMs can be reliably extrapolated to larger LLMs. This work provides valuable insights into the post-training of pruned LLMs and offers a practical scaling law for optimizing post-training data usage.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recently released model, Claude 3.5 Computer Use, stands out as the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta as a graphical user interface (GUI) agent. As an early beta, its capability in the real-world complex environment remains unknown. In this case study to explore Claude 3.5 Computer Use, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed tasks spanning a variety of domains and software. Observations from these cases demonstrate Claude 3.5 Computer Use's unprecedented ability in end-to-end language to desktop actions. Along with this study, we provide an out-of-the-box agent framework for deploying API-based GUI automation models with easy implementation. Our case studies aim to showcase a groundwork of capabilities and limitations of Claude 3.5 Computer Use with detailed analyses and bring to the fore questions about planning, action, and critic, which must be considered for future improvement. We hope this preliminary exploration will inspire future research into the GUI agent community.

Beyond the traditional bag-level loss, the mainstream methodology of LLP is to incorporate an auxiliary instance-level loss with pseudo-labels formed by predictions. Unfortunately, we empirically observed that the pseudo-labels are are often inaccurate due to over-smoothing, especially for the scenarios with large bag sizes, hurting the classifier induction. To alleviate this problem, we suggest a novel LLP method, namely Learning from Label Proportions with Auxiliary High-confident Instance-level Loss (L^2P-AHIL). Specifically, we propose a dual entropy-based weight (DEW) method to adaptively measure the confidences of pseudo-labels. It simultaneously emphasizes accurate predictions at the bag level and avoids overly smoothed predictions. We then form high-confident instance-level loss with DEW, and jointly optimize it with the bag-level loss in a self-training manner. The experimental results on benchmark datasets show that L^2P-AHIL can surpass the existing baseline methods, and the performance gain can be more significant as the bag size increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiqin Zhu, Dmitrii Torbunov, Yihui Ren, Zhongjing Jiang, Tianqiao Zhao, Amirthagunaraj Yogarathnam, Meng Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven modeling for dynamic systems has gained widespread attention in recent years. Its inverse formulation, parameter estimation, aims to infer the inherent model parameters from observations. However, parameter degeneracy, where different combinations of parameters yield the same observable output, poses a critical barrier to accurately and uniquely identifying model parameters. In the context of WECC composite load model (CLM) in power systems, utility practitioners have observed that CLM parameters carefully selected for one fault event may not perform satisfactorily in another fault. Here, we innovate a joint conditional diffusion model-based inverse problem solver (JCDI), that incorporates a joint conditioning architecture with simultaneous inputs of multi-event observations to improve parameter generalizability. Simulation studies on the WECC CLM show that the proposed JCDI effectively reduces uncertainties of degenerate parameters, thus the parameter estimation error is decreased by 42.1% compared to a single-event learning scheme. This enables the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting power trajectories under different fault events, including electronic load tripping and motor stalling, outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches. We anticipate this work will contribute to mitigating parameter degeneracy in system dynamics, providing a general parameter estimation framework across various scientific domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kapil Kumar Nagwanshi</p>
<p>Abstract: The human footprint is having a unique set of ridges unmatched by any other human being, and therefore it can be used in different identity documents for example birth certificate, Indian biometric identification system AADHAR card, driving license, PAN card, and passport. There are many instances of the crime scene where an accused must walk around and left the footwear impressions as well as barefoot prints and therefore, it is very crucial to recovering the footprints from identifying the criminals. Footprint-based biometric is a considerably newer technique for personal identification. Fingerprints, retina, iris and face recognition are the methods most useful for attendance record of the person. This time the world is facing the problem of global terrorism. It is challenging to identify the terrorist because they are living as regular as the citizens do. Their soft target includes the industries of special interests such as defence, silicon and nanotechnology chip manufacturing units, pharmacy sectors. They pretend themselves as religious persons, so temples and other holy places, even in markets is in their targets. These are the places where one can obtain their footprints quickly. The gait itself is sufficient to predict the behaviour of the suspects. The present research is driven to identify the usefulness of footprint and gait as an alternative to personal identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ermis Soumalias, Jakob Heiss, Jakob Weissteiner, Sven Seuken</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the design of iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, several papers have recently proposed machine learning (ML)-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most important information from bidders to maximize efficiency. The SOTA ML-based algorithms elicit bidders' preferences via value queries (i.e., "What is your value for the bundle $\{A,B\}$?"). However, the most popular iterative combinatorial auction in practice elicits information via more practical \emph{demand queries} (i.e., "At prices $p$, what is your most preferred bundle of items?"). In this paper, we examine the advantages of value and demand queries from both an auction design and an ML perspective. We propose a novel ML algorithm that provably integrates the full information from both query types. As suggested by our theoretical analysis, our experimental results verify that combining demand and value queries results in significantly better learning performance. Building on these insights, we present MLHCA, the most efficient ICA ever designed. MLHCA substantially outperforms the previous SOTA in realistic auction settings, delivering large efficiency gains. Compared to the previous SOTA, MLHCA reduces efficiency loss by up to a factor of 10, and in the most challenging and realistic domain, MLHCA outperforms the previous SOTA using 30% fewer queries. Thus, MLHCA achieves efficiency improvements that translate to welfare gains of hundreds of millions of USD, while also reducing the cognitive load on the bidders, establishing a new benchmark both for practicability and for economic impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anthonette Adanyin</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid spread of digital technologies has produced data-driven feedback loops, wearable devices, social media networks, and mobile applications that shape user behavior, motivation, and mental well-being. While these systems encourage self-improvement and the development of healthier habits through real-time feedback, they also create psychological risks such as technostress, addiction, and loss of autonomy. The present study also aims to investigate the positive and negative psychological consequences of feedback mechanisms on users' behaviour and well-being. Employing a descriptive survey method, the study collected data from 200 purposely selected users to assess changes in behaviour, motivation, and mental well-being related to health, social, and lifestyle applications. Results indicate that while feedback mechanisms facilitate goal attainment and social interconnection through streaks and badges, among other components, they also enhance anxiety, mental weariness, and loss of productivity due to actions that are considered feedback-seeking. Furthermore, test subjects reported that their actions are unconsciously shaped by app feedback, often at the expense of personal autonomy, while real-time feedback minimally influences professional or social interactions. The study shows that data-driven feedback loops deliver not only motivational benefits but also psychological challenges. To mitigate these risks, users should establish boundaries regarding their use of technology to prevent burnout and addiction, while developers need to refine feedback mechanisms to reduce cognitive load and foster more inclusive participation. Future research should focus on designing feedback mechanisms that promote well-being without compromising individual freedom or increasing social comparison.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeon-Taek Han, Dae-Hyeok Lee, Heon-Gyu Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct interaction between humans and computers by analyzing brain signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the non-invasive tools used in BCI systems, providing high temporal resolution for real-time applications. However, EEG signals are often affected by a low signal-to-noise ratio, physiological artifacts, and individual variability, representing challenges in extracting distinct features. Also, motor imagery (MI)-based EEG signals could contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics, which might cause the weights of the deep model to become biased towards those features. To address these problems, we proposed the end-to-end deep preprocessing method that effectively enhances MI characteristics while attenuating features with low correlation to MI characteristics. The proposed method consisted of the temporal, spatial, graph, and similarity blocks to preprocess MI-based EEG signals, aiming to extract more discriminative features and improve the robustness. We evaluated the proposed method using the public dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV to compare the performances when integrating the proposed method into the conventional models, including the DeepConvNet, the M-ShallowConvNet, and the EEGNet. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve the improved performances and lead to more clustered feature distributions of MI tasks. Hence, we demonstrated that our proposed method could enhance discriminative features related to MI characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amanda Vallentin</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagnostic imaging departments are under great pressure due to a growing workload. The number of required scans is growing and there is a shortage of qualified labor. AI solutions for medical imaging applications have shown great potential. However, very few diagnostic imaging models have been approved for hospital use and even fewer are being implemented at the hospitals. The most common reason why software projects fail is poor requirement engineering, especially non-functional requirements (NFRs) can be detrimental to a project. Research shows that machine learning professionals struggle to work with NFRs and that there is a need to adapt NFR frameworks to machine learning, AI-based, software. This study uses qualitative methods to interact with key stakeholders to identify which types of NFRs are important for medical imaging applications. The study was done on a single Danish hospital and found that NFRs of type Efficiency, Accuracy, Interoperability, Reliability, Usability, Adaptability, and Fairness were important to the stakeholders. Especially Efficiency since the diagnostic imaging department is trying to spend as little time as possible on each scan.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amna Najib, Stefan Depeweg, Phillip Swazinna</p>
<p>Abstract: Batch reinforcement learning enables policy learning without direct interaction with the environment during training, relying exclusively on previously collected sets of interactions. This approach is, therefore, well-suited for high-risk and cost-intensive applications, such as industrial control. Learned policies are commonly restricted to act in a similar fashion as observed in the batch. In a real-world scenario, learned policies are deployed in the industrial system, inevitably leading to the collection of new data that can subsequently be added to the existing recording. The process of learning and deployment can thus take place multiple times throughout the lifespan of a system. In this work, we propose to exploit this iterative nature of applying offline reinforcement learning to guide learned policies towards efficient and informative data collection during deployment, leading to continuous improvement of learned policies while remaining within the support of collected data. We present an algorithmic methodology for iterative batch reinforcement learning based on ensemble-based model-based policy search, augmented with safety and, importantly, a diversity criterion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Khodak, Lester Mackey, Alexandra Chouldechova, Miroslav Dud\'ik</p>
<p>Abstract: Disaggregated evaluation -- estimation of performance of a machine learning model on different subpopulations -- is a core task when assessing performance and group-fairness of AI systems. A key challenge is that evaluation data is scarce, and subpopulations arising from intersections of attributes (e.g., race, sex, age) are often tiny. Today, it is common for multiple clients to procure the same AI model from a model developer, and the task of disaggregated evaluation is faced by each customer individually. This gives rise to what we call the multi-task disaggregated evaluation problem, wherein multiple clients seek to conduct a disaggregated evaluation of a given model in their own data setting (task). In this work we develop a disaggregated evaluation method called SureMap that has high estimation accuracy for both multi-task and single-task disaggregated evaluations of blackbox models. SureMap's efficiency gains come from (1) transforming the problem into structured simultaneous Gaussian mean estimation and (2) incorporating external data, e.g., from the AI system creator or from their other clients. Our method combines maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using a well-chosen prior together with cross-validation-free tuning via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). We evaluate SureMap on disaggregated evaluation tasks in multiple domains, observing significant accuracy improvements over several strong competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marina A. Ayad, Ramin Nateghi, Abhishek Sharma, Lawrence Chillrud, Tilly Seesillapachai, Lee A. D. Cooper, Jeffery A. Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Inflammation of the umbilical cord can be seen as a result of ascending intrauterine infection or other inflammatory stimuli. Acute fetal inflammatory response (FIR) is characterized by infiltration of the umbilical cord by fetal neutrophils, and can be associated with neonatal sepsis or fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Recent advances in deep learning in digital pathology have demonstrated favorable performance across a wide range of clinical tasks, such as diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we classified FIR from whole slide images (WSI). We digitized 4100 histological slides of umbilical cord stained with hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) and extracted placental diagnoses from the electronic health record. We build models using attention-based whole slide learning models. We compared strategies between features extracted by a model (ConvNeXtXLarge) pretrained on non-medical images (ImageNet), and one pretrained using histopathology images (UNI). We trained multiple iterations of each model and combined them into an ensemble. The predictions from the ensemble of models trained using UNI achieved an overall balanced accuracy of 0.836 on the test dataset. In comparison, the ensembled predictions using ConvNeXtXLarge had a lower balanced accuracy of 0.7209. Heatmaps generated from top accuracy model appropriately highlighted arteritis in cases of FIR 2. In FIR 1, the highest performing model assigned high attention to areas of activated-appearing stroma in Wharton's Jelly. However, other high-performing models assigned attention to umbilical vessels. We developed models for diagnosis of FIR from placental histology images, helping reduce interobserver variability among pathologists. Future work may examine the utility of these models for identifying infants at risk of systemic inflammatory response or early onset neonatal sepsis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly machine learning techniques, are rapidly transforming tactical operations by augmenting human decision-making capabilities. This paper explores AI-driven Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) as a transformative approach, focusing on how it empowers human decision-making in complex environments. While trust and explainability continue to pose significant challenges, our exploration focuses on the potential of AI-driven HAT to transform tactical operations. By improving situational awareness and supporting more informed decision-making, AI-driven HAT can enhance the effectiveness and safety of such operations. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework that addresses the key components of AI-driven HAT, including trust and transparency, optimal function allocation between humans and AI, situational awareness, and ethical considerations. The proposed framework can serve as a foundation for future research and development in the field. By identifying and discussing critical research challenges and knowledge gaps in this framework, our work aims to guide the advancement of AI-driven HAT for optimizing tactical operations. We emphasize the importance of developing scalable and ethical AI-driven HAT systems that ensure seamless human-machine collaboration, prioritize ethical considerations, enhance model transparency through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, and effectively manage the cognitive load of human operators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Characterizing the loss of a neural network with respect to model parameters, i.e., the loss landscape, can provide valuable insights into properties of that model. Various methods for visualizing loss landscapes have been proposed, but less emphasis has been placed on quantifying and extracting actionable and reproducible insights from these complex representations. Inspired by powerful tools from topological data analysis (TDA) for summarizing the structure of high-dimensional data, here we characterize the underlying shape (or topology) of loss landscapes, quantifying the topology to reveal new insights about neural networks. To relate our findings to the machine learning (ML) literature, we compute simple performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, error), and we characterize the local structure of loss landscapes using Hessian-based metrics (e.g., largest eigenvalue, trace, eigenvalue spectral density). Following this approach, we study established models from image pattern recognition (e.g., ResNets) and scientific ML (e.g., physics-informed neural networks), and we show how quantifying the shape of loss landscapes can provide new insights into model performance and learning dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized computer-aided drug discovery, the AI community has predominantly focused on model innovation and placed less emphasis on establishing best benchmarking practices. We posit that without a sound model evaluation framework, the AI community's efforts cannot reach their full potential, thereby slowing the progress and transfer of innovation into real-world drug discovery. Thus, in this paper, we seek to establish a new gold standard for small molecule drug discovery benchmarking, WelQrate. Specifically, our contributions are threefold: WelQrate Dataset Collection - we introduce a meticulously curated collection of 9 datasets spanning 5 therapeutic target classes. Our hierarchical curation pipelines, designed by drug discovery experts, go beyond the primary high-throughput screen by leveraging additional confirmatory and counter screens along with rigorous domain-driven preprocessing, such as Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) filtering, to ensure the high-quality data in the datasets; WelQrate Evaluation Framework - we propose a standardized model evaluation framework considering high-quality datasets, featurization, 3D conformation generation, evaluation metrics, and data splits, which provides a reliable benchmarking for drug discovery experts conducting real-world virtual screening; Benchmarking - we evaluate model performance through various research questions using the WelQrate dataset collection, exploring the effects of different models, dataset quality, featurization methods, and data splitting strategies on the results. In summary, we recommend adopting our proposed WelQrate as the gold standard in small molecule drug discovery benchmarking. The WelQrate dataset collection, along with the curation codes, and experimental scripts are all publicly available at WelQrate.org.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by integrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.</p>

<p>Abstract: There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form medical question answering (QA). Most existing medical QA evaluation benchmarks focus on automatic metrics and multiple-choice questions. While valuable, these benchmarks fail to fully capture or assess the complexities of real-world clinical applications where LLMs are being deployed. Furthermore, existing studies on evaluating long-form answer generation in medical QA are primarily closed-source, lacking access to human medical expert annotations, which makes it difficult to reproduce results and enhance existing baselines. In this work, we introduce a new publicly available benchmark featuring real-world consumer medical questions with long-form answer evaluations annotated by medical doctors. We performed pairwise comparisons of responses from various open and closed-source medical and general-purpose LLMs based on criteria such as correctness, helpfulness, harmfulness, and bias. Additionally, we performed a comprehensive LLM-as-a-judge analysis to study the alignment between human judgments and LLMs. Our preliminary results highlight the strong potential of open LLMs in medical QA compared to leading closed models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Vasilevski, Dayi Lin, Ahmed Hassan</p>
<p>Abstract: To balance the quality and inference cost of a Foundation Model (FM, such as large language models (LLMs)) powered software, people often opt to train a routing model that routes requests to FMs with different sizes and capabilities. Existing routing models rely on learning the optimal routing decision from carefully curated data, require complex computations to be updated, and do not consider the potential evolution of weaker FMs. In this paper, we propose Real-time Adaptive Routing (RAR), an approach to continuously adapt FM routing decisions while using guided in-context learning to enhance the capabilities of weaker FM. The goal is to reduce reliance on stronger, more expensive FMs. We evaluate our approach on different subsets of the popular MMLU benchmark. Over time, our approach routes 50.2% fewer requests to computationally expensive models while maintaining around 90.5% of the general response quality. In addition, the guides generated from stronger models have shown intra-domain generalization and led to a better quality of responses compared to an equivalent approach with a standalone weaker FM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Wildfires pose a significantly increasing hazard to global ecosystems due to the climate crisis. Due to its complex nature, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to wildfire prediction, such as machine learning. This research took a unique approach, differentiating from classical supervised learning, and addressed the gap in unsupervised wildfire prediction using autoencoders and clustering techniques for anomaly detection. Historical weather and normalised difference vegetation index datasets of Australia for 2005 - 2021 were utilised. Two main unsupervised approaches were analysed. The first used a deep autoencoder to obtain latent features, which were then fed into clustering models, isolation forest, local outlier factor and one-class SVM for anomaly detection. The second approach used a deep autoencoder to reconstruct the input data and use reconstruction errors to identify anomalies. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders and fully connected (FC) autoencoders were employed in this part, both in an unsupervised way learning only from nominal data. The FC autoencoder outperformed its counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 0.71, an F1-score of 0.74, and an MCC of 0.42. These findings highlight the practicality of this method, as it effectively predicts wildfires in the absence of ground truth, utilising an unsupervised learning technique.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundational deep learning (DL) models are general models, trained on large, diverse, and unlabelled datasets, typically using self-supervised learning techniques have led to significant advancements especially in natural language processing. These pretrained models can be fine-tuned for related downstream tasks, offering faster development and reduced training costs, while often achieving improved performance. In this work, we introduce Masked Spectrogram Modeling, a novel self-supervised learning approach for pretraining foundational DL models on radio signals. Adopting a Convolutional LSTM architecture for efficient spatio-temporal processing, we pretrain the model with an unlabelled radio dataset collected from over-the-air measurements. Subsequently, the pretrained model is fine-tuned for two downstream tasks: spectrum forecasting and segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our methodology achieves competitive performance in both forecasting accuracy and segmentation, validating its effectiveness for developing foundational radio models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Zhou, Huaisheng Zhu, Rohan Sharma, Ruiyi Zhang, Kaiyi Ji, Changyou Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generation. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior to solve general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during the restoration sampling. To address this issue, we first reveal that forming the log posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., samples from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the reverse process. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., samples generated by a reverse denoising process, compared to random sampling with noise in standard methods) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Guo, Yixuan Wang, Yuanyuan Shi, Pan Xu, Anqi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training a policy in a source domain for deployment in the target domain under a dynamics shift can be challenging, often resulting in performance degradation. Previous work tackles this challenge by training on the source domain with modified rewards derived by matching distributions between the source and the target optimal trajectories. However, pure modified rewards only ensure the behavior of the learned policy in the source domain resembles trajectories produced by the target optimal policies, which does not guarantee optimal performance when the learned policy is actually deployed to the target domain. In this work, we propose to utilize imitation learning to transfer the policy learned from the reward modification to the target domain so that the new policy can generate the same trajectories in the target domain. Our approach, Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (DARAIL), utilizes the reward modification for domain adaptation and follows the general framework of generative adversarial imitation learning from observation (GAIfO) by applying a reward augmented estimator for the policy optimization step. Theoretically, we present an error bound for our method under a mild assumption regarding the dynamics shift to justify the motivation of our method. Empirically, our method outperforms the pure modified reward method without imitation learning and also outperforms other baselines in benchmark off-dynamics environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majid Molaei, Marcello Restelli, Alberto Maria Metelli, Matteo Papini</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy search methods are crucial in reinforcement learning, offering a framework to address continuous state-action and partially observable problems. However, the complexity of exploring vast policy spaces can lead to significant inefficiencies. Reducing the policy space through policy compression emerges as a powerful, reward-free approach to accelerate the learning process. This technique condenses the policy space into a smaller, representative set while maintaining most of the original effectiveness. Our research focuses on determining the necessary sample size to learn this compressed set accurately. We employ R\'enyi divergence to measure the similarity between true and estimated policy distributions, establishing error bounds for good approximations. To simplify the analysis, we employ the $l_1$ norm, determining sample size requirements for both model-based and model-free settings. Finally, we correlate the error bounds from the $l_1$ norm with those from R\'enyi divergence, distinguishing between policies near the vertices and those in the middle of the policy space, to determine the lower and upper bounds for the required sample sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andong Deng, Tongjia Chen, Shoubin Yu, Taojiannan Yang, Lincoln Spencer, Yapeng Tian, Ajmal Saeed Mian, Mohit Bansal, Chen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning, a new motion understanding task that requires generating visual answers (video segmentation masks) according to the input question, and hence needs implicit spatiotemporal reasoning and grounding. This task extends existing spatiotemporal grounding work focusing on explicit action/motion grounding, to a more general format by enabling implicit reasoning via questions. To facilitate the development of the new task, we collect a large-scale dataset called GROUNDMORE, which comprises 1,715 video clips, 249K object masks that are deliberately designed with 4 question types (Causal, Sequential, Counterfactual, and Descriptive) for benchmarking deep and comprehensive motion reasoning abilities. GROUNDMORE uniquely requires models to generate visual answers, providing a more concrete and visually interpretable response than plain texts. It evaluates models on both spatiotemporal grounding and reasoning, fostering to address complex challenges in motion-related video reasoning, temporal perception, and pixel-level understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a novel baseline model named Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning Assistant (MORA). MORA incorporates the multimodal reasoning ability from the Multimodal LLM, the pixel-level perception capability from the grounding model (SAM), and the temporal perception ability from a lightweight localization head. MORA achieves respectable performance on GROUNDMORE outperforming the best existing visual grounding baseline model by an average of 21.5% relatively. We hope this novel and challenging task will pave the way for future advancements in robust and general motion understanding via video reasoning segmentation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaito Baba, Ryota Yagi, Junichiro Takahashi, Risa Kishikawa, Satoshi Kodera</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ding Li, Ziqi Zhang, Mengyu Yao, Yifeng Cai, Yao Guo, Xiangqun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) are used to safeguard on-device models. However, directly employing TEEs to secure the entire DNN model is challenging due to the limited computational speed. Utilizing GPU can accelerate DNN's computation speed but commercial widely-available GPUs usually lack security protection. To this end, scholars introduce TSDP, a method that protects privacy-sensitive weights within TEEs and offloads insensitive weights to GPUs. Nevertheless, current methods do not consider the presence of a knowledgeable adversary who can access abundant publicly available pre-trained models and datasets. This paper investigates the security of existing methods against such a knowledgeable adversary and reveals their inability to fulfill their security promises. Consequently, we introduce a novel partition before training strategy, which effectively separates privacy-sensitive weights from other components of the model. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach can offer full model protection with a computational cost reduced by a factor of 10. In addition to traditional CNN models, we also demonstrate the scalability to large language models. Our approach can compress the private functionalities of the large language model to lightweight slices and achieve the same level of protection as the shielding-whole-model baseline.</p>

Comparative evaluations with other costly models confirm GGAvatar's superior quality and efficiency in modelling both clothed humans and separable garments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhang, Yihao Quan, Chaochen Gu, Chen Shen, Xiaosong Yuan, Shaotian Yan, Hao Cheng, Kaijie Wu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The hallucination problem in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a common issue. Although image tokens occupy a majority of the input sequence of MLLMs, there is limited research to explore the relationship between image tokens and hallucinations. In this paper, we analyze the distribution of attention scores for image tokens across each layer and head of the model, revealing an intriguing and common phenomenon: most hallucinations are closely linked to the pattern of attention sinks in the self-attention matrix of image tokens, where shallow layers exhibit dense attention sinks and deeper layers show sparse attention sinks. We further analyze the attention heads of different layers and find that heads with high-density attention sink in the image part play a positive role in alleviating hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a training-free method named \textcolor{red}{\textbf{E}}nhancing \textcolor{red}{\textbf{A}}ttention \textcolor{red}{\textbf{H}}eads (EAH), an approach designed to enhance the convergence of image tokens attention sinks in the shallow layers. EAH identifies the attention head that shows the vision sink in a shallow layer and extracts its attention matrix. This attention map is then broadcast to other heads in the layer, thereby strengthening the layer to pay more attention to the image itself. With extensive experiments, EAH shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewook Kim, Dhruv Agarwal, Jordan Ackerman, Manaswi Saha</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital media platforms (e.g., social media, science blogs) offer opportunities to communicate scientific content to general audiences at scale. However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels, and personal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging. To address this challenge, we designed TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that generates personalized translations of scientific text based on individual user profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an interactive slider that allows users to steer the degree of personalization from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging LLMs to generate the translations with given degrees. Through an exploratory study with 15 participants, we investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized translations and how interactive reading features influenced users' understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred higher degrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual translations, while those who preferred lower degrees valued concise translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported the compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of scientific content. Given these findings, we discuss several implications of AI-personalized translation tools in facilitating communication in collaborative contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taaha Kazi, Ruiliang Lyu, Sizhe Zhou, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Gokhan Tur</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditionally, offline datasets have been used to evaluate task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models. These datasets lack context awareness, making them suboptimal benchmarks for conversational systems. In contrast, user-agents, which are context-aware, can simulate the variability and unpredictability of human conversations, making them better alternatives as evaluators. Prior research has utilized large language models (LLMs) to develop user-agents. Our work builds upon this by using LLMs to create user-agents for the evaluation of TOD systems. This involves prompting an LLM, using in-context examples as guidance, and tracking the user-goal state. Our evaluation of diversity and task completion metrics for the user-agents shows improved performance with the use of better prompts. Additionally, we propose methodologies for the automatic evaluation of TOD models within this dynamic framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) targets a critical real-world challenge, aiming to categorize inputs into known categories, termed closed-set classes, while identifying open-set inputs that fall outside these classes. Although transfer learning where a model is tuned to a given few-shot task has become a prominent paradigm in closed-world, we observe that it fails to expand to open-world. To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to simulate open-set examples by modifying the training dataset or generating pseudo open-set examples. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, with only a 1.5\% increase in training effort. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in FSOSR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation deep learning (DL) models are general models, designed to learn general, robust and adaptable representations of their target modality, enabling finetuning across a range of downstream tasks. These models are pretrained on large, unlabeled datasets using self-supervised learning (SSL). Foundation models have demonstrated better generalization than traditional supervised approaches, a critical requirement for wireless communications where the dynamic environment demands model adaptability. In this work, we propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of a Vision Transformer (ViT) as a radio foundation model for spectrogram learning. We introduce a Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM) approach to pretrain the ViT in a self-supervised fashion. We evaluate the ViT-based foundation model on two downstream tasks: Channel State Information (CSI)-based Human Activity sensing and Spectrogram Segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance to supervised training while generalizing across diverse domains. Notably, the pretrained ViT model outperforms a four-times larger model that is trained from scratch on the spectrogram segmentation task, while requiring significantly less training time, and achieves competitive performance on the CSI-based human activity sensing task. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of ViT with MSM for pretraining as a promising technique for scalable foundation model development in future 6G networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties have achieved significant success in modeling complex dynamic systems and molecular properties. However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rising prevalence of vision-threatening retinal diseases poses a significant burden on the global healthcare systems. Deep learning (DL) offers a promising solution for automatic disease screening but demands substantial data. Collecting and labeling large volumes of ophthalmic images across various modalities encounters several real-world challenges, especially for rare diseases. Here, we introduce EyeDiff, a text-to-image model designed to generate multimodal ophthalmic images from natural language prompts and evaluate its applicability in diagnosing common and rare diseases. EyeDiff is trained on eight large-scale datasets using the advanced latent diffusion model, covering 14 ophthalmic image modalities and over 80 ocular diseases, and is adapted to ten multi-country external datasets. The generated images accurately capture essential lesional characteristics, achieving high alignment with text prompts as evaluated by objective metrics and human experts. Furthermore, integrating generated images significantly enhances the accuracy of detecting minority classes and rare eye diseases, surpassing traditional oversampling methods in addressing data imbalance. EyeDiff effectively tackles the issue of data imbalance and insufficiency typically encountered in rare diseases and addresses the challenges of collecting large-scale annotated images, offering a transformative solution to enhance the development of expert-level diseases diagnosis models in ophthalmic field.</p>

(2) Data Augment, simulate user's profile, background story, and psychological activities. (3) Dataset construction, personality-conditioned instruction prompting (PCIP) to stimulate LLMs. (4) Modeling and Training, personality-conditioned instruction tuning (PTIT and PSIT), using the generated data to enhance existing open-source LLMs. We introduce OrcaBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the quality of content generated by LLMs on social platforms across multiple scales.

<p>Abstract: Numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers around the world operate a variety of NWP models, and recent advances in AI-driven NWP models have increased the availability of diverse NWP outputs. While this expansion holds the potential to improve forecast accuracy, it also raises a critical challenge of identifying the most reliable predictions for specific forecast scenarios. Traditional approaches, such as ensemble or weighted averaging, combine multiple NWP outputs but often generate unrealistic atmospheric fields, complicating the production of reliable and consistent forecasts in operational settings. In this study, we introduce DeepMedcast, a deep learning method that generates intermediate forecast, or "medcast", between two or more NWP outputs. Unlike ensemble averaging, DeepMedcast can provide consistent and explainable medcast without distorting meteorological fields. This paper details the methodology and case studies of DeepMedcast, discussing its advantages and potential contributions to operational forecasting.</p>

This extreme class imbalance poses a challenge for deep learning models with the different micro-scale cracks, as the network can be biased toward predicting the majority class, generally leading to poor detection accuracy. This study builds upon the previous benchmark SpAsE-Net, an asymmetric encoder-decoder network for micro-crack detection. The impact of various activation and loss functions were examined through feature space visualization using the manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) algorithm. The optimized architecture and training methodology achieved an accuracy of 86.85%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhao Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to detect and track all objects in a scene across frames, while maintaining a unique identity for each object. Most existing methods rely on the spatial motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial feature representation, improving upon the clustering association method MOT\_FCG. For spatial motion features, we propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT\_FCG, we achieved 76.1 HOTA, 80.4 MOTA and 81.3 IDF1 on the MOT17 validation set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack validation sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zhong, Yinhao Xiao, Minghui Xu, Xiuzhen Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Short video platforms have become important channels for news dissemination, offering a highly engaging and immediate way for users to access current events and share information. However, these platforms have also emerged as significant conduits for the rapid spread of misinformation, as fake news and rumors can leverage the visual appeal and wide reach of short videos to circulate extensively among audiences. Existing fake news detection methods mainly rely on single-modal information, such as text or images, or apply only basic fusion techniques, limiting their ability to handle the complex, multi-layered information inherent in short videos. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel fake news detection method based on multimodal information, designed to identify misinformation through a multi-level analysis of video content. This approach effectively utilizes different modal representations to generate a unified textual description, which is then fed into a large language model for comprehensive evaluation. The proposed framework successfully integrates multimodal features within videos, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fake news detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and utilization of multimodal information, achieving an accuracy of 90.93%, which is significantly higher than the best baseline model (SV-FEND) at 81.05%. Furthermore, case studies provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the approach in accurately distinguishing between fake news, debunking content, and real incidents, highlighting its reliability and robustness in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan He, Guofen Wang, Weisheng Li, Yucheng Shu, Wenbo Li, Lijian Yang, Yuping Huang, Feiyan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate information from different modalities to obtain a comprehensive image, aiding downstream tasks. However, existing methods tend to prioritize natural image fusion and focus on information complementary and network training strategies. They ignore the essential distinction between natural and medical image fusion and the influence of underlying components. This paper dissects the significant differences between the two tasks regarding fusion goals, statistical properties, and data distribution. Based on this, we rethink the suitability of the normalization strategy and convolutional kernels for end-to-end MMIF.Specifically, this paper proposes a mixture of instance normalization and group normalization to preserve sample independence and reinforce intrinsic feature correlation.This strategy promotes the potential of enriching feature maps, thus boosting fusion performance. To this end, we further introduce the large kernel convolution, effectively expanding receptive fields and enhancing the preservation of image detail. Moreover, the proposed multipath adaptive fusion module recalibrates the decoder input with features of various scales and receptive fields, ensuring the transmission of crucial information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance in multiple fusion tasks and significantly improves downstream applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tymofii Nikolaienko, Harshil Patel, Aniruddha Panda, Subodh Madhav Joshi, Stanislav Jaso, Kaushic Kalyanaraman</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an influential technology, merging the swift and automated capabilities of machine learning with the precision and dependability of simulations grounded in theoretical physics. PINNs are often employed to solve algebraic or differential equations to replace some or even all steps of multi-stage computational workflows, leading to their significant speed-up. However, wide adoption of PINNs is still hindered by reliability issues, particularly at extreme ends of the input parameter ranges. In this study, we demonstrate this in the context of a system of coupled non-linear differential reaction-diffusion and heat transfer equations related to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which are solved by a finite-difference method with a PINN used in evaluating their source terms. It is shown that the testing strategies traditionally used to assess the accuracy of neural networks as function approximators can overlook the peculiarities which ultimately cause instabilities of the finite-difference solver. We propose a domain knowledge-based modifications to the PINN architecture ensuring its correct asymptotic behavior. When combined with an improved numerical scheme employed as an initial guess generator, the proposed modifications are shown to recover the overall stability of the simulations, while preserving the speed-up brought by PINN as the workflow component. We discuss the possible applications of the proposed hybrid transport equation solver in context of chemical reactors simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Climate change poses an urgent global threat, needing the rapid identification and deployment of innovative solutions. We hypothesise that many of these solutions already exist within scientific literature but remain underutilised. To address this gap, this study employs a curated dataset sourced from OpenAlex, a comprehensive repository of scientific papers. Utilising Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT4-o from OpenAI, we evaluate title-abstract pairs from scientific papers on seven dimensions, covering climate change mitigation potential, stage of technological development, and readiness for deployment. The outputs of the language models are then compared with human evaluations to assess their effectiveness in identifying promising yet overlooked climate innovations. Our findings suggest that these LLM-based models can effectively augment human expertise, uncovering climate solutions that are potentially impactful but with far greater speed, throughput and consistency. Here, we focused on UK-based solutions, but the workflow is region-agnostic. This work contributes to the discovery of neglected innovations in scientific literature and demonstrates the potential of AI in enhancing climate action strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Liu, Jiangxia Cao, Rui Huang, Kai Zheng, Qiang Luo, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In large-scale content recommendation systems, retrieval serves as the initial stage in the pipeline, responsible for selecting thousands of candidate items from billions of options to pass on to ranking modules. Traditionally, the dominant retrieval method has been Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) dual-tower structure. However, applying transformer in retrieval tasks has been the focus of recent research, though real-world industrial deployment still presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce KuaiFormer, a novel transformer-based retrieval framework deployed in a large-scale content recommendation system. KuaiFormer fundamentally redefines the retrieval process by shifting from conventional score estimation tasks (such as click-through rate estimate) to a transformer-driven Next Action Prediction paradigm. This shift enables more effective real-time interest acquisition and multi-interest extraction, significantly enhancing retrieval performance. KuaiFormer has been successfully integrated into Kuaishou App's short-video recommendation system since May 2024, serving over 400 million daily active users and resulting in a marked increase in average daily usage time of Kuaishou users. We provide insights into both the technical and business aspects of deploying transformer in large-scale recommendation systems, addressing practical challenges encountered during industrial implementation. Our findings offer valuable guidance for engineers and researchers aiming to leverage transformer models to optimize large-scale content recommendation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rutger Hendrix, Federica Proietto Salanitri, Concetto Spampinato, Simone Palazzo, Ulas Bagci</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FedEvPrompt, a federated learning approach that integrates principles of evidential deep learning, prompt tuning, and knowledge distillation for distributed skin lesion classification. FedEvPrompt leverages two sets of prompts: b-prompts (for low-level basic visual knowledge) and t-prompts (for task-specific knowledge) prepended to frozen pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models trained in an evidential learning framework to maximize class evidences. Crucially, knowledge sharing across federation clients is achieved only through knowledge distillation on attention maps generated by the local ViT models, ensuring enhanced privacy preservation compared to traditional parameter or synthetic image sharing methodologies. FedEvPrompt is optimized within a round-based learning paradigm, where each round involves training local models followed by attention maps sharing with all federation clients. Experimental validation conducted in a real distributed setting, on the ISIC2019 dataset, demonstrates the superior performance of FedEvPrompt against baseline federated learning algorithms and knowledge distillation methods, without sharing model parameters. In conclusion, FedEvPrompt offers a promising approach for federated learning, effectively addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity, imbalance, privacy preservation, and knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate people counting in smart buildings and intelligent transportation systems is crucial for energy management, safety protocols, and resource allocation. This is especially critical during emergencies, where precise occupant counts are vital for safe evacuation. Existing methods struggle with large crowds, often losing accuracy with even a few additional people. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel approach combining a new object tracking algorithm, a novel counting algorithm, and a fine-tuned object detection model. This method achieves 97% accuracy in real-time people counting with a frame rate of 20-27 FPS on a low-power edge computer.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10087">PFML: Self-Supervised Learning of Time-Series Data Without Representation Collapse</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Einari Vaaras, Manu Airaksinen, Okko R\"as\"anen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar pre-existing SSL method and competitive against the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI data, incorporating functional MRI data is challenging due to its complex structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address this, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder, a custom deep learning framework designed to improve brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. This model separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, isolating shared and modality-specific features. By integrating multitask learning with sex classification as an additional task, the model captures sex-specific aging patterns. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset, a large multisite brain MRI collection, the model achieves a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, outperforming traditional methods. This success positions M-AVAE as a powerful tool for metaverse-based healthcare applications in brain age estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heatwaves (HWs) are extreme atmospheric events that produce significant societal and environmental impacts. Predicting these extreme events remains challenging, as their complex interactions with large-scale atmospheric and climatic variables are difficult to capture with traditional statistical and dynamical models. This work presents a general method for driver identification in extreme climate events. A novel framework (STCO-FS) is proposed to identify key immediate (short-term) HW drivers by combining clustering algorithms with an ensemble evolutionary algorithm. The framework analyzes spatio-temporal data, reduces dimensionality by grouping similar geographical nodes for each variable, and develops driver selection in spatial and temporal domains, identifying the best time lags between predictive variables and HW occurrences. The proposed method has been applied to analyze HWs in the Adda river basin in Italy. The approach effectively identifies significant variables influencing HWs in this region. This research can potentially enhance our understanding of HW drivers and predictability.</p>

Through systematic testing of legal cases from common law systems and China, this paper explores the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in understanding and applying legal texts, reasoning through legal issues, and predicting judgments. The experimental results highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in legal applications, particularly in terms of challenges related to the interpretation of legal language and the accuracy of legal reasoning.

<p>Abstract: The process industry's high expectations for Digital Twins require modeling approaches that can generalize across tasks and diverse domains with potentially different data dimensions and distributional shifts i.e., Foundational Models. Despite success in natural language processing and computer vision, transfer learning with (self-) supervised signals for pre-training general-purpose models is largely unexplored in the context of Digital Twins in the process industry due to challenges posed by multi-dimensional time-series data, lagged cause-effect dependencies, complex causal structures, and varying number of (exogenous) variables. We propose a novel channel-dependent pre-training strategy that leverages synchronized cause-effect pairs to overcome these challenges by breaking down the multi-dimensional time-series data into pairs of cause-effect variables. Our approach focuses on: (i) identifying highly lagged causal relationships using data-driven methods, (ii) synchronizing cause-effect pairs to generate training samples for channel-dependent pre-training, and (iii) evaluating the effectiveness of this approach in channel-dependent forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and generalization capability compared to traditional training methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anant Garg, K Madhava Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: In autonomous driving with image based state space, accurate prediction of future events and modeling diverse behavioral modes are essential for safety and effective decision-making. World model-based Reinforcement Learning (WMRL) approaches offers a promising solution by simulating future states from current state and actions. However, utility of world models is often limited by typical RL policies being limited to deterministic or single gaussian distribution. By failing to capture the full spectrum of possible actions, reduces their adaptability in complex, dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce Imagine-2-Drive, a framework that consists of two components, VISTAPlan, a high-fidelity world model for accurate future prediction and Diffusion Policy Actor (DPA), a diffusion based policy to model multi-modal behaviors for trajectory prediction. We use VISTAPlan to simulate and evaluate trajectories from DPA and use Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) to train DPA to maximize the cumulative sum of rewards over the trajectories. We analyze the benefits of each component and the framework as a whole in CARLA with standard driving metrics. As a consequence of our twin novelties- VISTAPlan and DPA, we significantly outperform the state of the art (SOTA) world models on standard driving metrics by 15% and 20% on Route Completion and Success Rate respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The extraction of causal information from textual data is crucial in the industry for identifying and mitigating potential failures, enhancing process efficiency, prompting quality improvements, and addressing various operational challenges. This paper presents a study on the development of automated methods for causal information extraction from actual industrial documents in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The study proposes two types of causal information extraction methods, single-stage sequence tagging (SST) and multi-stage sequence tagging (MST), and evaluates their performance using existing documents from a semiconductor manufacturing company, including presentation slides and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) documents. The study also investigates the effect of representation learning on downstream tasks. The presented case study showcases that the proposed MST methods for extracting causal information from industrial documents are suitable for practical applications, especially for semi structured documents such as FMEAs, with a 93\% F1 score. Additionally, MST achieves a 73\% F1 score on texts extracted from presentation slides. Finally, the study highlights the importance of choosing a language model that is more aligned with the domain and in-domain fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benoit Coqueret, Mathieu Carbone, Olivier Sentieys, Gabriel Zaid</p>
<p>Abstract: During the past decade, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) proved their value on a large variety of subjects. However despite their high value and public accessibility, the protection of the intellectual property of DNNs is still an issue and an emerging research field. Recent works have successfully extracted fully-connected DNNs using cryptanalytic methods in hard-label settings, proving that it was possible to copy a DNN with high fidelity, i.e., high similitude in the output predictions. However, the current cryptanalytic attacks cannot target complex, i.e., not fully connected, DNNs and are limited to special cases of neurons present in deep networks.
  In this work, we introduce a new end-to-end attack framework designed for model extraction of embedded DNNs with high fidelity. We describe a new black-box side-channel attack which splits the DNN in several linear parts for which we can perform cryptanalytic extraction and retrieve the weights in hard-label settings. With this method, we are able to adapt cryptanalytic extraction, for the first time, to non-fully connected DNNs, while maintaining a high fidelity. We validate our contributions by targeting several architectures implemented on a microcontroller unit, including a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) of 1.7 million parameters and a shortened MobileNetv1. Our framework successfully extracts all of these DNNs with high fidelity (88.4% for the MobileNetv1 and 93.2% for the MLP). Furthermore, we use the stolen model to generate adversarial examples and achieve close to white-box performance on the victim's model (95.8% and 96.7% transfer rate).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Schneider, Robert Krug, Narunas Vaskevicius, Luigi Palmieri, Joschka Boedecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often require extensive amounts of data. As opposed to model-free RL, model-based RL (MBRL) offers a potential solution with efficient data utilization through planning. Additionally, RL lacks generalization capabilities for real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that incorporating pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) enhances sample efficiency and generalization. While PVRs have been extensively studied in the context of model-free RL, their potential in MBRL remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we benchmark a set of PVRs on challenging control tasks in a model-based RL setting. We investigate the data efficiency, generalization capabilities, and the impact of different properties of PVRs on the performance of model-based agents. Our results, perhaps surprisingly, reveal that for MBRL current PVRs are not more sample efficient than learning representations from scratch, and that they do not generalize better to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To explain this, we analyze the quality of the trained dynamics model. Furthermore, we show that data diversity and network architecture are the most important contributors to OOD generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenghua Ling, Kang Chen, Jiye Wu, Tao Han, Jing-Jia Luo, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Seamless forecasting that produces warning information at continuum timescales based on only one system is a long-standing pursuit for weather-climate service. While the rapid advancement of deep learning has induced revolutionary changes in classical forecasting field, current efforts are still focused on building separate AI models for weather and climate forecasts. To explore the seamless forecasting ability based on one AI model, we propose FengWu-Weather to Subseasonal (FengWu-W2S), which builds on the FengWu global weather forecast model and incorporates an ocean-atmosphere-land coupling structure along with a diverse perturbation strategy. FengWu-W2S can generate 6-hourly atmosphere forecasts extending up to 42 days through an autoregressive and seamless manner. Our hindcast results demonstrate that FengWu-W2S reliably predicts atmospheric conditions out to 3-6 weeks ahead, enhancing predictive capabilities for global surface air temperature, precipitation, geopotential height and intraseasonal signals such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Moreover, our ablation experiments on forecast error growth from daily to seasonal timescales reveal potential pathways for developing AI-based integrated system for seamless weather-climate forecasting in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangxin Meng, Zexiong Ma, Pengfei Gao, Chao Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent and non-agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine seven proprietary and open-source systems on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting instances solvable by all or none of these sytems, and explore why some instances are uniquely solved by specific system types. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and line levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities, identifying instances solvable only through dynamic reproduction. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Liu, Zhuoqi Ma, Kun Xie, Zhicheng Jiao, Qiguang Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology reports are crucial for planning treatment strategies and enhancing doctor-patient communication, yet manually writing these reports is burdensome for radiologists. While automatic report generation offers a solution, existing methods often rely on single-view radiographs, limiting diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, we propose MCL, a Multi-view enhanced Contrastive Learning method for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we first introduce multi-view enhanced contrastive learning for visual representation by maximizing agreements between multi-view radiographs and their corresponding report. Subsequently, to fully exploit patient-specific indications (e.g., patient's symptoms) for report generation, we add a transitional ``bridge" for missing indications to reduce embedding space discrepancies caused by their presence or absence. Additionally, we construct Multi-view CXR and Two-view CXR datasets from public sources to support research on multi-view report generation. Our proposed MCL surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 5.0% F1 RadGraph improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 7.3% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN, a 3.1% BLEU-4 improvement on Multi-view CXR, and an 8.2% F1 CheXbert improvement on Two-view CXR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanath Budakegowdanadoddi Nagaraju, Brian Bernhard Moser, Tobias Christian Nauen, Stanislav Frolov, Federico Raue, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR) models have recently advanced image reconstruction quality, yet challenges remain due to computational complexity and an over-reliance on large patch sizes, which constrain fine-grained detail enhancement. In this work, we propose TaylorIR to address these limitations by utilizing a patch size of 1x1, enabling pixel-level processing in any transformer-based SR model. To address the significant computational demands under the traditional self-attention mechanism, we employ the TaylorShift attention mechanism, a memory-efficient alternative based on Taylor series expansion, achieving full token-to-token interactions with linear complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art SR performance while reducing memory consumption by up to 60% compared to traditional self-attention-based transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingxi Yin, Zhi Li, Jingfeng Zhang, Chenglin Li, Yin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, with their impressive generative capabilities, have been adopted for image editing tasks, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. Bieniek, M. Rahouti, D. C. Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: As the boundaries of human computer interaction expand, Generative AI emerges as a key driver in reshaping user interfaces, introducing new possibilities for personalized, multimodal and cross-platform interactions. This integration reflects a growing demand for more adaptive and intuitive user interfaces that can accommodate diverse input types such as text, voice and video, and deliver seamless experiences across devices. This paper explores the integration of generative AI in modern user interfaces, examining historical developments and focusing on multimodal interaction, cross-platform adaptability and dynamic personalization. A central theme is the interface dilemma, which addresses the challenge of designing effective interactions for multimodal large language models, assessing the trade-offs between graphical, voice-based and immersive interfaces. The paper further evaluates lightweight frameworks tailored for mobile platforms, spotlighting the role of mobile hardware in enabling scalable multimodal AI. Technical and ethical challenges, including context retention, privacy concerns and balancing cloud and on-device processing are thoroughly examined. Finally, the paper outlines future directions such as emotionally adaptive interfaces, predictive AI driven user interfaces and real-time collaborative systems, underscoring generative AI's potential to redefine adaptive user-centric interfaces across platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Kaiser, Nikolas Adaloglou, Markus Kollmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidance is an error-correcting technique used to improve the perceptual quality of images generated by diffusion models. Typically, the correction is achieved by linear extrapolation, using an auxiliary diffusion model that has lower performance than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar errors as the primary one but stronger. We verify this finding in higher dimensions, where we show that competitive generative performance to state-of-the-art guidance methods can be achieved when the auxiliary model differs from the primary one only by having stronger weight regularization. As an independent contribution, we investigate whether upweighting long-range spatial dependencies improves visual fidelity. The result is a novel guidance method, which we call sliding window guidance (SWG), that guides the primary model with itself by constraining its receptive field. Intriguingly, SWG aligns better with human preferences than state-of-the-art guidance methods while requiring neither training, architectural modifications, nor class conditioning. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Zhou, Jiacheng Yao, Xuanze Chen, Shanqing Yu, Qi Xuan, Xiaoniu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lateral movement is a crucial component of advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks in networks. Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities in internal networks or IoT devices, expanding their control after initial infiltration to steal sensitive data or carry out other malicious activities, posing a serious threat to system security. Existing research suggests that attackers generally employ seemingly unrelated operations to mask their malicious intentions, thereby evading existing lateral movement detection methods and hiding their intrusion traces. In this regard, we analyze host authentication log data from a graph perspective and propose a multi-scale lateral movement detection framework called LMDetect. The main workflow of this framework proceeds as follows: 1) Construct a heterogeneous multigraph from host authentication log data to strengthen the correlations among internal system entities; 2) Design a time-aware subgraph generator to extract subgraphs centered on authentication events from the heterogeneous authentication multigraph; 3) Design a multi-scale attention encoder that leverages both local and global attention to capture hidden anomalous behavior patterns in the authentication subgraphs, thereby achieving lateral movement detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world authentication log datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting lateral movement behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Palacios, Rafael Medina, Jean-Luc Rouas, Giovanni Ansaloni, David Atienza</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient deployment of resource-intensive transformers on edge devices necessitates cross-stack optimization. We thus study the interrelation between structured pruning and systolic acceleration, matching the size of pruned blocks with the systolic array dimensions. In this setting, computations of pruned weight blocks can be skipped, reducing run-time and energy consumption, but potentially impacting quality of service (QoS). To evaluate the trade-offs between systolic array size and sparsity opportunities, we present a novel co-design framework that integrates algorithmic optimization, system simulation, and hardware design. Targeting speech recognition using transformers as a case study, we analyze how configuration choices across the stack affect performance metrics. Results demonstrate that structured pruning on systems featuring systolic array acceleration can effectively increase performance, while maintaining high QoS levels. Up to 26% system-wide speedups due to structured pruning were measured, with only 1.4% word error rate degradation on the standard Librispeech dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the ParClusterers Benchmark Suite (PCBS) -- a collection of highly scalable parallel graph clustering algorithms and benchmarking tools that streamline comparing different graph clustering algorithms and implementations.
  The benchmark includes clustering algorithms that target a wide range of modern clustering use cases, including community detection, classification, and dense subgraph mining.
  The benchmark toolkit makes it easy to run and evaluate multiple instances of different clustering algorithms, which can be useful for fine-tuning the performance of clustering on a given task, and for comparing different clustering algorithms based on different metrics of interest, including clustering quality and running time.
  Using PCBS, we evaluate a broad collection of real-world graph clustering datasets. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the best quality results are obtained by algorithms that not included in many popular graph clustering toolkits. The PCBS provides a standardized way to evaluate and judge the quality-performance tradeoffs of the active research area of scalable graph clustering algorithms. We believe it will help enable fair, accurate, and nuanced evaluation of graph clustering algorithms in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoma Yataka, Adriano Cardace, Pu Perry Wang, Petros Boufounos, Ryuhei Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.77+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.</p>

This paper presents a physically motivated image processing pipeline for simulating the characteristics of collimator shadows in X-ray images. By generating randomized labels for collimator shapes and locations, incorporating scattered radiation simulation, and including Poisson noise, the pipeline enables the expansion of limited datasets for training deep neural networks. We validate the proposed pipeline by a qualitative and quantitative comparison against real collimator shadows. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that utilizing simulated data within our deep learning framework not only serves as a suitable substitute for actual collimators but also enhances the generalization performance when applied to real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huming Qiu, Guanxu Chen, Mi Zhang, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant progress in generating high-quality images that align with text descriptions. However, these models also face the risk of unsafe generation, potentially producing harmful content that violates usage policies, such as explicit material. Existing safe generation methods typically focus on suppressing inappropriate content by erasing undesired concepts from visual representations, while neglecting to sanitize the textual representation. Although these methods help mitigate the risk of misuse to certain extent, their robustness remains insufficient when dealing with adversarial attacks.
  Given that semantic consistency between input text and output image is a fundamental requirement for T2I models, we identify that textual representations (i.e., prompt embeddings) are likely the primary source of unsafe generation. To this end, we propose a vision-agnostic safe generation framework, Embedding Sanitizer (ES), which focuses on erasing inappropriate concepts from prompt embeddings and uses the sanitized embeddings to guide the model for safe generation. ES is applied to the output of the text encoder as a plug-and-play module, enabling seamless integration with different T2I models as well as other safeguards. In addition, ES's unique scoring mechanism assigns a score to each token in the prompt to indicate its potential harmfulness, and dynamically adjusts the sanitization intensity to balance defensive performance and generation quality. Through extensive evaluation on five prompt benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness by sanitizing the source (prompt embedding) of unsafe generation compared to nine baseline methods. It significantly outperforms existing safeguards in terms of interpretability and controllability while maintaining generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fault diagnosis technology supports the healthy operation of mechanical equipment. However, the variations conditions during the operation of mechanical equipment lead to significant disparities in data distribution, posing challenges to fault diagnosis. Furthermore, when deploying applications, traditional methods often encounter issues such as latency and data security. Therefore, conducting fault diagnosis and deploying application methods under cross-operating conditions holds significant value. This paper proposes a domain adaptation-based lightweight fault diagnosis framework for edge computing scenarios. Incorporating the local maximum mean discrepancy into knowledge transfer aligns the feature distributions of different domains in a high-dimensional feature space, to discover a common feature space across domains. The acquired fault diagnosis expertise from the cloud-model is transferred to the lightweight edge-model using adaptation knowledge transfer methods. While ensuring real-time diagnostic capabilities, accurate fault diagnosis is achieved across working conditions. We conducted validation experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit. In terms of diagnostic performance, the proposed method significantly improved diagnostic accuracy, with average increases of 34.44% and 17.33% compared to the comparison method, respectively. Regarding lightweight effectiveness, proposed method achieved an average inference speed increase of 80.47%. Additionally, compared to the cloud-model, the parameter count of the edge-model decreased by 96.37%, while the Flops decreased by 83.08%.</p>

This way, one can pinpoint the deficiencies of data-based detection, thereby offering explainability during their incremental improvement. We show that a continual learning implementation is subject to catastrophic forgetting, and additionally show that forgetting can be addressed by employing a joint training strategy on all generated FDIA scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wei, Wencheng Han, Xingping Dong, Jianbing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion-based Single-image 3D portrait generation methods typically employ 2D diffusion models to provide multi-view knowledge, which is then distilled into 3D representations. However, these methods usually struggle to produce high-fidelity 3D models, frequently yielding excessively blurred textures. We attribute this issue to the insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency during the diffusion process, resulting in significant disparities between different views and ultimately leading to blurred 3D representations. In this paper, we address this issue by comprehensively exploiting multi-view priors in both the conditioning and diffusion procedures to produce consistent, detail-rich portraits. From the conditioning standpoint, we propose a Hybrid Priors Diffsion model, which explicitly and implicitly incorporates multi-view priors as conditions to enhance the status consistency of the generated multi-view portraits. From the diffusion perspective, considering the significant impact of the diffusion noise distribution on detailed texture generation, we propose a Multi-View Noise Resamplig Strategy integrated within the optimization process leveraging cross-view priors to enhance representation consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce 3D portraits with accurate geometry and rich details from a single image.

<p>Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has become a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), aimed at automatically extracting causalities from textual data. In this survey, we systematically address the foundational principles, technical frameworks, and challenges of ECI, offering a comprehensive taxonomy to categorize and clarify current research methodologies, as well as a quantitative assessment of existing models. We first establish a conceptual framework for ECI, outlining key definitions, problem formulations, and evaluation standards. Our taxonomy classifies ECI methods according to the two primary tasks of sentence-level (SECI) and document-level (DECI) event causality identification. For SECI, we examine feature pattern-based matching, deep semantic encoding, causal knowledge pre-training and prompt-based fine-tuning, and external knowledge enhancement methods. For DECI, we highlight approaches focused on event graph reasoning and prompt-based techniques to address the complexity of cross-sentence causal inference. Additionally, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and open challenges of each approach. We further conduct an extensive quantitative evaluation of various ECI methods on two benchmark datasets. Finally, we explore future research directions, highlighting promising pathways to overcome current limitations and broaden ECI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek, Aylin Yener, Sennur Ulukus</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address task-oriented (or goal-oriented) communications where an encoder at the transmitter learns compressed latent representations of data, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder performs a machine learning task, specifically for classifying the received signals. The deep neural networks corresponding to the encoder-decoder pair are jointly trained, taking both channel and data characteristics into account. Our objective is to achieve high accuracy in completing the underlying task while minimizing the number of channel uses determined by the encoder's output size. To this end, we propose a multi-round, multi-task learning (MRMTL) approach for the dynamic update of channel uses in multi-round transmissions. The transmitter incrementally sends an increasing number of encoded samples over the channel based on the feedback from the receiver, and the receiver utilizes the signals from a previous round to enhance the task performance, rather than only considering the latest transmission. This approach employs multi-task learning to jointly optimize accuracy across varying number of channel uses, treating each configuration as a distinct task. By evaluating the confidence of the receiver in task decisions, MRMTL decides on whether to allocate additional channel uses in multiple rounds. We characterize both the accuracy and the delay (total number of channel uses) of MRMTL, demonstrating that it achieves the accuracy close to that of conventional methods requiring large numbers of channel uses, but with reduced delay by incorporating signals from a prior round. We consider the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural network architectures, and AWGN and Rayleigh channel models for performance evaluation. We show that MRMTL significantly improves the efficiency of task-oriented communications, balancing accuracy and latency effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Internal crack detection has been a subject of focus in structural health monitoring. By focusing on crack detection in structural datasets, it is demonstrated that deep learning (DL) methods can effectively analyze seismic wave fields interacting with micro-scale cracks, which are beyond the resolution of conventional visual inspection. This work explores a novel application of DL-based key point detection technique, where cracks are localized by predicting the coordinates of four key points that define a bounding region of the crack. The study not only opens new research directions for non-visual applications but also effectively mitigates the impact of imbalanced data which poses a challenge for previous DL models, as it can be biased toward predicting the majority class (non-crack regions). Popular DL techniques, such as the Inception blocks, are used and investigated. The model shows an overall reduction in loss when applied to micro-scale crack detection and is reflected in the lower average deviation between the location of actual and predicted cracks, with an average Intersection over Union (IoU) being 0.511 for all micro cracks (greater than 0.00 micrometers) and 0.631 for larger micro cracks (greater than 4 micrometers).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeffrey Olmo, Jared Wilson, Max Forsey, Bryce Hepner, Thomas Vin Howe, David Wingate</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach for extracting neural network representations by learning a sparse and overcomplete decomposition of the network's internal activations. However, SAEs are traditionally trained considering only activation values and not the effect those activations have on downstream computations. This limits the information available to learn features, and biases the autoencoder towards neglecting features which are represented with small activation values but strongly influence model outputs. To address this, we introduce Gradient SAEs (g-SAEs), which modify the $k$-sparse autoencoder architecture by augmenting the TopK activation function to rely on the gradients of the input activation when selecting the $k$ elements. For a given sparsity level, g-SAEs produce reconstructions that are more faithful to original network performance when propagated through the network. Additionally, we find evidence that g-SAEs learn latents that are on average more effective at steering models in arbitrary contexts. By considering the downstream effects of activations, our approach leverages the dual nature of neural network features as both $\textit{representations}$, retrospectively, and $\textit{actions}$, prospectively. While previous methods have approached the problem of feature discovery primarily focused on the former aspect, g-SAEs represent a step towards accounting for the latter as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Karmann, Onay Urfalioglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in interactive point prompt based Image Segmentation allows to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic labels. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and training-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion. We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov-chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation. Despite being training-free, we experimentally show that our approach yields excellent results in terms of Number of Clicks (NoC), even outperforming state-of-the-art training based unsupervised methods in most of the datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri, Nikhil Varghese, Chandra Khatri, Amol Kelkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems rely on predefined conversation schemes (dialogue flows) often represented as directed acyclic graphs. These flows can be manually designed or automatically generated from previously recorded conversations. Due to variations in domain expertise or reliance on different sets of prior conversations, these dialogue flows can manifest in significantly different graph structures. Despite their importance, there is no standard method for evaluating the quality of dialogue flows. We introduce FuDGE (Fuzzy Dialogue-Graph Edit Distance), a novel metric that evaluates dialogue flows by assessing their structural complexity and representational coverage of the conversation data. FuDGE measures how well individual conversations align with a flow and, consequently, how well a set of conversations is represented by the flow overall. Through extensive experiments on manually configured flows and flows generated by automated techniques, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FuDGE and its evaluation framework. By standardizing and optimizing dialogue flows, FuDGE enables conversational designers and automated techniques to achieve higher levels of efficiency and automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parsa Hejabi, Elnaz Rahmati, Alireza S. Ziabari, Preni Golazizian, Jesse Thomason, Morteza Dehghani</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex tasks and interactive environments, yet their creativity remains underexplored. This paper introduces a simulation framework utilizing the game Balderdash to evaluate both the creativity and logical reasoning of LLMs. In Balderdash, players generate fictitious definitions for obscure terms to deceive others while identifying correct definitions. Our framework enables multiple LLM agents to participate in this game, assessing their ability to produce plausible definitions and strategize based on game rules and history. We implemented a centralized game engine featuring various LLMs as participants and a judge LLM to evaluate semantic equivalence. Through a series of experiments, we analyzed the performance of different LLMs, examining metrics such as True Definition Ratio, Deception Ratio, and Correct Guess Ratio. The results provide insights into the creative and deceptive capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Specifically, the study reveals that infrequent vocabulary in LLMs' input leads to poor reasoning on game rules and historical context (https://github.com/ParsaHejabi/Simulation-Framework-for-Multi-Agent-Balderdash).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Fu, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are known to hallucinate, which limits their practical applications. Recent works have attempted to apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the performance of MLLMs, but have shown inconsistent improvements in mitigating hallucinations. To address this issue more effectively, we introduce Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike previous approaches, our method tackles hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes. Specifically, we develop three types of preference pair data targeting the following causes of MLLM hallucinations: (1) insufficient visual capabilities, (2) long context generation, and (3) multimodal conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our method and suggest the potential for further improvements through scaling up.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Ekpo, Mara Levy, Saksham Suri, Chuong Huynh, Abhinav Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for robot task planning, but challenges remain due to VLMs' tendency to generate incorrect action sequences. To address these limitations, we propose VeriGraph, a novel framework that integrates VLMs for robotic planning while verifying action feasibility. VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the cognitive science theory of the explicit human memory systems, we have modeled an agent with short-term, episodic, and semantic memory systems, each of which is modeled with a knowledge graph. To evaluate this system and analyze the behavior of this agent, we designed and released our own reinforcement learning agent environment, "the Room", where an agent has to learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its return by answering questions. We show that our deep Q-learning based agent successfully learns whether a short-term memory should be forgotten, or rather be stored in the episodic or semantic memory systems. Our experiments indicate that an agent with human-like memory systems can outperform an agent without this memory structure in the environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxwell Joseph Jacobson, Yexiang Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Design generation requires tight integration of neural and symbolic reasoning, as good design must meet explicit user needs and honor implicit rules for aesthetics, utility, and convenience. Current automated design tools driven by neural networks produce appealing designs but cannot satisfy user specifications and utility requirements. Symbolic reasoning tools, such as constraint programming, cannot perceive low-level visual information in images or capture subtle aspects such as aesthetics. We introduce the Spatial Reasoning Integrated Generator (SPRING) for design generation. SPRING embeds a neural and symbolic integrated spatial reasoning module inside the deep generative network. The spatial reasoning module samples the set of locations of objects to be generated from a backtrack-free distribution. This distribution modifies the implicit preference distribution, which is learned by a recursive neural network to capture utility and aesthetics. Sampling from the backtrack-free distribution is accomplished by a symbolic reasoning approach, SampleSearch, which zeros out the probability of sampling spatial locations violating explicit user specifications. Embedding symbolic reasoning into neural generation guarantees that the output of SPRING satisfies user requirements. Furthermore, SPRING offers interpretability, allowing users to visualize and diagnose the generation process through the bounding boxes. SPRING is also adept at managing novel user specifications not encountered during its training, thanks to its proficiency in zero-shot constraint transfer. Quantitative evaluations and a human study reveal that SPRING outperforms baseline generative models, excelling in delivering high design quality and better meeting user specifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venetia Pliatsika, Joao Fonseca, Kateryna Akhynko, Ivan Shevchenko, Julia Stoyanovich</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic decisions in critical domains such as hiring, college admissions, and lending are often based on rankings. Because of the impact these decisions have on individuals, organizations, and population groups, there is a need to understand them: to help individuals improve their position in a ranking, design better ranking procedures, and check whether a procedure is legally compliant. In this paper, we present ShaRP - Shapley for Rankings and Preferences - a framework that explains the contributions of features to different aspects of a ranked outcome and is based on Shapley values. Using ShaRP, we show that even when the scoring function used by an algorithmic ranker is known and linear, the feature weights do not correspond to their Shapley value contribution. The contributions instead depend on the feature distributions and the subtle local interactions between the scoring features.
  ShaRP builds on the Quantitative Input Influence framework to compute the contributions of features for multiple - ranking specific - Quantities of Interest, including score, rank, pair-wise preference, and top-k. We show the results of an extensive experimental validation of ShaRP using real and synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that feature importance can be computed efficiently, and that ShaRP compares favorably to several prior local feature importance methods, in terms of both generality and quality of explanations. Among our results, we highlight a case study on the CS Rankings dataset. Contrary to expectation, we find that a strong track record in Systems research is much more important than AI research for placing a CS department among the top-10%.
  ShaRP is available as an open-source library at https://github.com/DataResponsibly/ShaRP and is already used in teaching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Zhelun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The potential of Machine Learning Control (MLC) in HVAC systems is hindered by its opaque nature and inference mechanisms, which is challenging for users and modelers to fully comprehend, ultimately leading to a lack of trust in MLC-based decision-making. To address this challenge, this paper investigates and explores Interpretable Machine Learning (IML), a branch of Machine Learning (ML) that enhances transparency and understanding of models and their inferences, to improve the credibility of MLC and its industrial application in HVAC systems. Specifically, we developed an innovative framework that combines the principles of Shapley values and the in-context learning feature of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the Shapley values are instrumental in dissecting the contributions of various features in ML models, LLM provides an in-depth understanding of the non-data-driven or rule-based elements in MLC; combining them, LLM further packages these insights into a coherent, human-understandable narrative. The paper presents a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed IML framework for model predictive control-based precooling under demand response events in a virtual testbed. The results indicate that the developed framework generates and explains the control signals in accordance with the rule-based rationale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Sevillano-Garc\'ia, Juli\'an Luengo, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become integral across domains, the demand for explainability grows, the called eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Existing efforts primarily focus on generating and evaluating explanations for black-box models while a critical gap in directly enhancing models remains through these evaluations. It is important to consider the potential of this explanation process to improve model quality with a feedback on training as well. XAI may be used to improve model performance while boosting its explainability. Under this view, this paper introduces Transformation - Selective Hidden Input Evaluation for Learning Dynamics (T-SHIELD), a regularization family designed to improve model quality by hiding features of input, forcing the model to generalize without those features. Within this family, we propose the XAI - SHIELD(X-SHIELD), a regularization for explainable artificial intelligence, which uses explanations to select specific features to hide. In contrast to conventional approaches, X-SHIELD regularization seamlessly integrates into the objective function enhancing model explainability while also improving performance. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets underscores X-SHIELD's effectiveness in improving performance and overall explainability. The improvement is validated through experiments comparing models with and without the X-SHIELD regularization, with further analysis exploring the rationale behind its design choices. This establishes X-SHIELD regularization as a promising pathway for developing reliable artificial intelligence regularization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced analytics science methods have enabled combining the power of artificial and human intelligence, creating \textit{centaurs} that allow superior decision-making. Centaurs are hybrid human-algorithm models that combine both formal analytics and human intuition in a symbiotic manner within their learning and reasoning process. We argue that the future of AI development and use in many domains needs to focus more on centaurs as opposed to other AI approaches. This paradigm shift towards centaur-based AI methods raises some fundamental questions: How are centaurs different from other human-in-the-loop methods? What are the most effective methods for creating centaurs? When should centaurs be used, and when should the lead be given to pure AI models? Doesn't the incorporation of human intuition -- which at times can be misleading -- in centaurs' decision-making process degrade its performance compared to pure AI methods? This work aims to address these fundamental questions, focusing on recent advancements in generative AI, and especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), as a main case study to illustrate centaurs' critical essentiality to future AI endeavors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Debot, Pietro Barbiero, Francesco Giannini, Gabriele Ciravegna, Michelangelo Diligenti, Giuseppe Marra</p>
<p>Abstract: The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of deep learning systems presents a significant challenge in modern artificial intelligence (AI), as it impairs users' ability to rely on and verify these systems. To address this challenge, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have made significant progress by incorporating human-interpretable concepts into deep learning architectures. This approach allows predictions to be traced back to specific concept patterns that users can understand and potentially intervene on. However, existing CBMs' task predictors are not fully interpretable, preventing a thorough analysis and any form of formal verification of their decision-making process prior to deployment, thereby raising significant reliability concerns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Concept-based Memory Reasoner (CMR), a novel CBM designed to provide a human-understandable and provably-verifiable task prediction process. Our approach is to model each task prediction as a neural selection mechanism over a memory of learnable logic rules, followed by a symbolic evaluation of the selected rule. The presence of an explicit memory and the symbolic evaluation allow domain experts to inspect and formally verify the validity of certain global properties of interest for the task prediction process. Experimental results demonstrate that CMR achieves better accuracy-interpretability trade-offs to state-of-the-art CBMs, discovers logic rules consistent with ground truths, allows for rule interventions, and allows pre-deployment verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Xie, Shuoyoucheng Ma, Zhenhua Wang, Enze Wang, Kai Chen, Xiaobing Sun, Baosheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The cognitive mechanism by which Large Language Models (LLMs) solve mathematical problems remains a widely debated and unresolved issue. Currently, there is little interpretable experimental evidence that connects LLMs' problem-solving with human cognitive psychology.To determine if LLMs possess human-like mathematical reasoning, we modified the problems used in the human Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). Our results show that, even with the use of Chains of Thought (CoT) prompts, mainstream LLMs, including the latest o1 model (noted for its reasoning capabilities), have a high error rate when solving these modified CRT problems. Specifically, the average accuracy rate dropped by up to 50% compared to the original questions.Further analysis of LLMs' incorrect answers suggests that they primarily rely on pattern matching from their training data, which aligns more with human intuition (System 1 thinking) rather than with human-like reasoning (System 2 thinking). This finding challenges the belief that LLMs have genuine mathematical reasoning abilities comparable to humans. As a result, this work may adjust overly optimistic views on LLMs' progress towards artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative class of AI tools capable of revolutionizing various aspects of healthcare by generating human-like responses across diverse contexts and adapting to novel tasks following human instructions. Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Halil Ibrahim Aysel, Xiaohao Cai, Adam Pr\"ugel-Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision aiming to identify and classify individual pixels in an image, with numerous applications in for example autonomous driving and medical image analysis. However, semantic segmentation can be highly challenging particularly due to the need for large amounts of annotated data. Annotating images is a time-consuming and costly process, often requiring expert knowledge and significant effort; moreover, saving the annotated images could dramatically increase the storage space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation, requiring the rough information of individual semantic class proportions, shortened as semantic proportions, rather than the necessity of ground-truth segmentation maps. This greatly simplifies the data annotation process and thus will significantly reduce the annotation time, cost and storage space, opening up new possibilities for semantic segmentation tasks where obtaining the full ground-truth segmentation maps may not be feasible or practical. Our proposed method of utilising semantic proportions can (i) further be utilised as a booster in the presence of ground-truth segmentation maps to gain performance without extra data and model complexity, and (ii) also be seen as a parameter-free plug-and-play module, which can be attached to existing deep neural networks designed for semantic segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the good performance of our method compared to benchmark methods that rely on ground-truth segmentation maps. Utilising semantic proportions suggested in this work offers a promising direction for future semantic segmentation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Hector, Pierre-Alain Moellic, Mathieu Dumont, Jean-Max Dutertre</p>
<p>Abstract: Model extraction emerges as a critical security threat with attack vectors exploiting both algorithmic and implementation-based approaches. The main goal of an attacker is to steal as much information as possible about a protected victim model, so that he can mimic it with a substitute model, even with a limited access to similar training data. Recently, physical attacks such as fault injection have shown worrying efficiency against the integrity and confidentiality of embedded models. We focus on embedded deep neural network models on 32-bit microcontrollers, a widespread family of hardware platforms in IoT, and the use of a standard fault injection strategy - Safe Error Attack (SEA) - to perform a model extraction attack with an adversary having a limited access to training data. Since the attack strongly depends on the input queries, we propose a black-box approach to craft a successful attack set. For a classical convolutional neural network, we successfully recover at least 90% of the most significant bits with about 1500 crafted inputs. These information enable to efficiently train a substitute model, with only 8% of the training dataset, that reaches high fidelity and near identical accuracy level than the victim model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Liu, Yanzhe Zhang, Peng Li, Yang Liu, Diyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that collaborating multiple large language model (LLM) powered agents is a promising way for task solving. However, current approaches are constrained by using a fixed number of agents and static communication structures. In this work, we propose automatically selecting a team of agents from candidates to collaborate in a dynamic communication structure toward different tasks and domains. Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network ($\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-powered agent collaboration, operating a two-stage paradigm: (1) Team Optimization and (2) Task Solving. During the first stage, we utilize an $\textit{agent selection}$ algorithm, based on an unsupervised metric called $\textit{Agent Importance Score}$, enabling the selection of best agents according to their contributions in a preliminary trial, oriented to the given task. Then, in the second stage, the selected agents collaborate dynamically according to the query. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN outperforms strong baselines in code generation, decision-making, general reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning tasks with moderate computational cost. On specific subjects in MMLU, selecting a team of agents in the team optimization stage improves accuracy by up to 25.0% in DyLAN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has been catalyzed by advancements in pre-training techniques. These models have demonstrated robust reasoning capabilities through manually designed prompts. In this work, we evaluate the conversational reasoning capabilities of the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) on knowledge graphs (KGs). However, the performance of LLMs is constrained due to a lack of KG environment awareness and the difficulties in developing effective optimization mechanisms for intermediary reasoning stages. We further introduce LLM-ARK, a LLM grounded KG reasoning agent designed to deliver precise and adaptable predictions on KG paths. LLM-ARK leverages Full Textual Environment (FTE) prompt to assimilate state information within each reasoning step. We reframe the challenge of multi-hop reasoning on the KG as a sequential decision-making task. Utilizing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) online policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, our model is optimized to learn from rich reward signals. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation of our model and GPT-4 on the OpenDialKG dataset. The experimental results reveal that LLaMA-2-7B-ARK outperforms the current state-of-the-art model by 5.28 percentage points, with a performance rate of 36.39% on the target@1 evaluation metric. Meanwhile, GPT-4 scored 14.91%, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Aipura/LLM-ARK) for further access.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badhan Chandra Das, M. Hadi Amini, Yanzhao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities and contributed to multiple fields, such as generating and summarizing text, language translation, and question-answering. Nowadays, LLM is becoming a very popular tool in computerized language processing tasks, with the capability to analyze complicated linguistic patterns and provide relevant and appropriate responses depending on the context. While offering significant advantages, these models are also vulnerable to security and privacy attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, data poisoning attacks, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage attacks. This survey provides a thorough review of the security and privacy challenges of LLMs for both training data and users, along with the application-based risks in various domains, such as transportation, education, and healthcare. We assess the extent of LLM vulnerabilities, investigate emerging security and privacy attacks for LLMs, and review the potential defense mechanisms. Additionally, the survey outlines existing research gaps in this domain and highlights future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Zhang, Zhelun Chen, Vitaly Ford</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progression in artificial intelligence has facilitated the emergence of large language models like ChatGPT, offering potential applications extending into specialized engineering modeling, especially physics-based building energy modeling. This paper investigates the innovative integration of large language models with building energy modeling software, focusing specifically on the fusion of ChatGPT with EnergyPlus. A literature review is first conducted to reveal a growing trend of incorporating large language models in engineering modeling, albeit limited research on their application in building energy modeling. We underscore the potential of large language models in addressing building energy modeling challenges and outline potential applications including simulation input generation, simulation output analysis and visualization, conducting error analysis, co-simulation, simulation knowledge extraction and training, and simulation optimization. Three case studies reveal the transformative potential of large language models in automating and optimizing building energy modeling tasks, underscoring the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in advancing sustainable building practices and energy efficiency. The case studies demonstrate that selecting the right large language model techniques is essential to enhance performance and reduce engineering efforts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiwei Liu, Guanchen Tao, Yifei Zou, Derek Chow, Zichen Fan, Kauna Lei, Bangfei Pan, Dennis Sylvester, Gregory Kielian, Mehdi Saligane</p>
<p>Abstract: The self-attention mechanism distinguishes transformer-based large language models (LLMs) apart from convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Despite the performance improvement, achieving real-time LLM inference on silicon remains challenging due to the extensive use of Softmax in self-attention. In addition to the non-linearity, the low arithmetic intensity significantly limits processing parallelism, especially when working with longer contexts. To address this challenge, we propose Constant Softmax (ConSmax), a software-hardware co-design that serves as an efficient alternative to Softmax. ConSmax utilizes differentiable normalization parameters to eliminate the need for maximum searching and denominator summation in Softmax. This approach enables extensive parallelization while still executing the essential functions of Softmax. Moreover, a scalable ConSmax hardware design with a bitwidth-split look-up table (LUT) can achieve lossless non-linear operations and support mixed-precision computing. Experimental results show that ConSmax achieves a minuscule power consumption of 0.2mW and an area of 0.0008mm^2 at 1250MHz working frequency in 16nm FinFET technology. For open-source contribution, we further implement our design with the OpenROAD toolchain under SkyWater's 130nm CMOS technology. The corresponding power is 2.69mW and the area is 0.007mm^2. ConSmax achieves 3.35x power savings and 2.75x area savings in 16nm technology, and 3.15x power savings and 4.14x area savings with the open-source EDA toolchain. In the meantime, it also maintains comparable accuracy on the GPT-2 model and the WikiText103 dataset. The project is available at https://github.com/ReaLLMASIC/ConSmax</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haeji Jung, Changdae Oh, Jooeon Kang, Jimin Sohn, Kyungwoo Song, Jinkyu Kim, David R. Mortensen</p>
<p>Abstract: Approaches to improving multilingual language understanding often struggle with significant performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages. While there are efforts to align the languages in a single latent space to mitigate such gaps, how different input-level representations influence such gaps has not been investigated, particularly with phonemic inputs. We hypothesize that the performance gaps are affected by representation discrepancies between these languages, and revisit the use of phonemic representations as a means to mitigate these discrepancies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, we present experiments on three representative cross-lingual tasks on 12 languages in total. The results show that phonemic representations exhibit higher similarities between languages compared to orthographic representations, and it consistently outperforms grapheme-based baseline model on languages that are relatively low-resourced. We present quantitative evidence from three cross-lingual tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, and it is further justified by a theoretical analysis of the cross-lingual performance gap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Long, George Killick, Lipeng Zhuang, Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa, Zaiqiao Meng, Richard Mccreadie</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art pre-trained image models predominantly adopt a two-stage approach: initial unsupervised pre-training on large-scale datasets followed by task-specific fine-tuning using Cross-Entropy loss~(CE). However, it has been demonstrated that CE can compromise model generalization and stability. While recent works employing contrastive learning address some of these limitations by enhancing the quality of embeddings and producing better decision boundaries, they often overlook the importance of hard negative mining and rely on resource intensive and slow training using large sample batches. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel approach named CLCE, which integrates Label-Aware Contrastive Learning with CE. Our approach not only maintains the strengths of both loss functions but also leverages hard negative mining in a synergistic way to enhance performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CLCE significantly outperforms CE in Top-1 accuracy across twelve benchmarks, achieving gains of up to 3.52% in few-shot learning scenarios and 3.41% in transfer learning settings with the BEiT-3 model. Importantly, our proposed CLCE approach effectively mitigates the dependency of contrastive learning on large batch sizes such as 4096 samples per batch, a limitation that has previously constrained the application of contrastive learning in budget-limited hardware environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangqiang Ding, Yunzhou Zhu, Xiangyu Wen, Gaowen Liu, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing egocentric 3D hand pose estimation systems that can perform reliably in complex, real-world scenarios is crucial for downstream applications. Previous approaches using RGB or NIR imagery struggle in challenging conditions: RGB methods are susceptible to lighting variations and obstructions like handwear, while NIR techniques can be disrupted by sunlight or interference from other NIR-equipped devices. To address these limitations, we present ThermoHands, the first benchmark focused on thermal image-based egocentric 3D hand pose estimation, demonstrating the potential of thermal imaging to achieve robust performance under these conditions. The benchmark includes a multi-view and multi-spectral dataset collected from 28 subjects performing hand-object and hand-virtual interactions under diverse scenarios, accurately annotated with 3D hand poses through an automated process. We introduce a new baseline method, TherFormer, utilizing dual transformer modules for effective egocentric 3D hand pose estimation in thermal imagery. Our experimental results highlight TherFormer's leading performance and affirm thermal imaging's effectiveness in enabling robust 3D hand pose estimation in adverse conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Shi, Zenghui Yuan, Yinuo Liu, Yue Huang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge uses a large language model (LLM) to select the best response from a set of candidates for a given question. LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanwook Park, Sourav Saha, Jiachen Guo, Hantao Zhang, Xiaoyu Xie, Miguel A. Bessa, Dong Qian, Wei Chen, Gregory J. Wagner, Jian Cao, Wing Kam Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, shifting from task-specific codes (Software 1.0) to neural network-based approaches (Software 2.0). However, applying this transition in engineering software presents challenges, including low surrogate model accuracy, the curse of dimensionality in inverse design, and rising complexity in physical simulations. We introduce an interpolating neural network (INN), grounded in interpolation theory and tensor decomposition, to realize Engineering Software 2.0 by advancing data training, partial differential equation solving, and parameter calibration. INN offers orders of magnitude fewer trainable/solvable parameters for comparable model accuracy than traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Demonstrated in metal additive manufacturing, INN rapidly constructs an accurate surrogate model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) heat transfer simulation, achieving sub-10-micrometer resolution for a 10 mm path in under 15 minutes on a single GPU. This makes a transformative step forward across all domains essential to engineering software.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel May, Matthew Taylor, Petr Musilek</p>
<p>Abstract: As distributed energy resources (DERs) grow, the electricity grid faces increased net load variability at the grid edge, impacting operability and reliability. Transactive energy, facilitated through local energy markets, offers a decentralized, indirect demand response solution, with model-free control techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling automated, decentralized participation. However, existing studies largely overlook community-level net load variability, focusing instead on socioeconomic metrics.
  This study addresses this gap by using DRL agents to automate end-user participation in a local energy market (ALEX), where agents act independently to minimize individual energy bills. Results reveal a strong link between bill reduction and decreased net load variability, assessed across metrics such as ramping rate, load factor, and peak demand over various time horizons. Using a no-control baseline, DRL agents are benchmarked against a near-optimal dynamic programming approach. The dynamic programming benchmark achieves reductions of 22.05 percent, 83.92 percent, and 24.09 percent in daily import, export, and peak demand, respectively, while the DRL agents show comparable or superior results with reductions of 21.93 percent, 84.46 percent, and 27.02 percent.
  This study demonstrates the effectiveness of DRL in decentralized grid management, highlighting its scalability and near-optimal performance in reducing net load variability within community-driven energy markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfu Jiang, Xuan He, Huaye Zeng, Cong Wei, Max Ku, Qian Liu, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great results in single-image vision language tasks. However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved. The existing LMMs like OpenFlamingo, Emu2, and Idefics gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from the web, which is neither efficient nor effective. In this paper, we aim to build strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources. Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K multi-image instruction data to train a family of Mantis models. The instruction tuning empowers Mantis with different multi-image skills like co-reference, comparison, reasoning, and temporal understanding. We evaluate Mantis on 8 multi-image benchmarks and 6 single-image benchmarks. Mantis-Idefics2 can achieve SoTA results on all the multi-image benchmarks and beat the strongest multi-image baseline, Idefics2-8B by an average of 13 absolute points. Notably, Idefics2-8B was pre-trained on 140M interleaved multi-image data, which is 200x larger than Mantis-Instruct. We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out benchmarks, which shows its generalization ability. We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis also maintains a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2. Our results show that multi-image abilities are not necessarily gained through massive pre-training, instead, they can be gained by low-cost instruction tuning. The training and evaluation of Mantis has paved the road for future work to improve LMMs' multi-image abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanjin Yao, Wenhao Wu, Taojiannan Yang, YuXin Song, Mengxi Zhang, Haocheng Feng, Yifan Sun, Zhiheng Li, Wanli Ouyang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Do we fully leverage the potential of visual encoder in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in multimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and industry. In the current MLLM rat race, the focus seems to be predominantly on the linguistic side. We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality instruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet, scant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs, often assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual encoder. In this paper, we introduce the Dense Connector - a simple, effective, and plug-and-play vision-language connector that significantly enhances existing MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features, with minimal additional computational overhead. Building on this, we also propose the Efficient Dense Connector, which achieves performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5 with only 25% of the visual tokens. Furthermore, our model, trained solely on images, showcases remarkable zero-shot capabilities in video understanding as well. Experimental results across various vision encoders, image resolutions, training dataset scales, varying sizes of LLMs (2.7B->70B), and diverse architectures of MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA-v1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and Mini-Gemini) validate the versatility and scalability of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 19 image and video benchmarks. We hope that this work will provide valuable experience and serve as a basic module for future MLLM development. Code is available at https://github.com/HJYao00/DenseConnector .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Huang, Zhengyang Tang, Dongdong Ge, Shixi Hu, Ruoqing Jiang, Benyou Wang, Zizhuo Wang, Xin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving play a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate these tasks. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling as well as developing and executing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we introduce a semi-automated data synthesis framework designed for optimization modeling issues, named OR-Instruct. This framework merges the training data requirements of large models with the unique characteristics of optimization modeling problems, and allows for customizable enhancements tailored to specific scenarios or modeling types. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we present the IndustryOR benchmark, the inaugural industrial standard for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. Utilizing data synthesized through OR-Instruct, we train various open-source LLMs with a capacity of 7 billion parameters (dubbed ORLMs). The resulting model demonstrates significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushuang Zhou, Lei Clifton, Zijun Liu, Kannie W. Y. Chan, David A. Clifton, Yuan-Ting Zhang, Yining Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: The label scarcity problem is the main challenge that hinders the wide application of deep learning systems in automatic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) detection using electrocardiography (ECG). Tuning pre-trained models alleviates this problem by transferring knowledge learned from large datasets to downstream small datasets. However, bottlenecks in computational efficiency and detection performance limit its clinical applications. It is difficult to improve the detection performance without significantly sacrificing the computational efficiency during model training. Here, we propose a computation-efficient semi-supervised learning paradigm (CE-SSL) for robust and computation-efficient CVDs detection using ECG. It enables a robust adaptation of pre-trained models on downstream datasets with limited supervision and high computational efficiency. First, a random-deactivation technique is developed to achieve robust and fast low-rank adaptation of pre-trained weights. Subsequently, we propose a one-shot rank allocation module to determine the optimal ranks for the update matrices of the pre-trained weights. Finally, a lightweight semi-supervised learning pipeline is introduced to enhance model performance by leveraging labeled and unlabeled data with high computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four downstream datasets demonstrate that CE-SSL not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in multi-label CVDs detection but also consumes fewer GPU footprints, training time, and parameter storage space. As such, this paradigm provides an effective solution for achieving high computational efficiency and robust detection performance in the clinical applications of pre-trained models under limited supervision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diya Li, Asim Kadav, Aijing Gao, Rui Li, Richard Bourgon</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraction of lung lesion information from clinical and medical imaging reports is crucial for research on and clinical care of lung-related diseases. Large language models (LLMs) can be effective at interpreting unstructured text in reports, but they often hallucinate due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to reduced accuracy and posing challenges for use in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel framework that aligns generated internal knowledge with external knowledge through in-context learning (ICL). Our framework employs a retriever to identify relevant units of internal or external knowledge and a grader to evaluate the truthfulness and helpfulness of the retrieved internal-knowledge rules, to align and update the knowledge bases. Experiments with expert-curated test datasets demonstrate that this ICL approach can increase the F1 score for key fields (lesion size, margin and solidity) by an average of 12.9% over existing ICL methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Investigations into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Korean industrial reviews are notably lacking in the existing literature. Our research proposes an intuitive and effective framework for ABSA in low-resource languages such as Korean. It optimizes prediction labels by integrating translated benchmark and unlabeled Korean data. Using a model fine-tuned on translated data, we pseudo-labeled the actual Korean NLI set. Subsequently, we applied LaBSE and \MSP{}-based filtering to this pseudo-NLI set as implicit feature, enhancing Aspect Category Detection and Polarity determination through additional training. Incorporating dual filtering, this model bridged dataset gaps, achieving positive results in Korean ABSA with minimal resources. Through additional data injection pipelines, our approach aims to utilize high-resource data and construct effective models within communities, whether corporate or individual, in low-resource language countries. Compared to English ABSA, our framework showed an approximately 3\% difference in F1 scores and accuracy. We release the dataset and our code for Korean ABSA, at this link.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayk Caldas Ramos, Christopher J. Collison, Andrew D. White</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry, significantly impacting molecule design, property prediction, and synthesis optimization. This review highlights LLM capabilities in these domains and their potential to accelerate scientific discovery through automation. We also review LLM-based autonomous agents: LLMs with a broader set of tools to interact with their surrounding environment. These agents perform diverse tasks such as paper scraping, interfacing with automated laboratories, and synthesis planning. As agents are an emerging topic, we extend the scope of our review of agents beyond chemistry and discuss across any scientific domains. This review covers the recent history, current capabilities, and design of LLMs and autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration, model interpretability, and the need for standard benchmarks, while future directions point towards more sophisticated multi-modal agents and enhanced collaboration between agents and experimental methods. Due to the quick pace of this field, a repository has been built to keep track of the latest studies: https://github.com/ur-whitelab/LLMs-in-science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chethan Krishnamurthy Ramanaik, Arjun Roy, Eirini Ntoutsi</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in Autoencoders (AEs) for tasks like dimensionality reduction, representation learning and data generation, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), with their probabilistic approach to disentangling latent spaces, show stronger resistance to such perturbations compared to deterministic AEs; however, their resilience against adversarial inputs is still a concern. This study evaluates the robustness of VAEs against non-targeted adversarial attacks by optimizing minimal sample-specific perturbations to cause maximal damage across diverse demographic subgroups (combinations of age and gender). We investigate two questions: whether there are robustness disparities among subgroups, and what factors contribute to these disparities, such as data scarcity and representation entanglement. Our findings reveal that robustness disparities exist but are not always correlated with the size of the subgroup. By using downstream gender and age classifiers and examining latent embeddings, we highlight the vulnerability of subgroups like older women, who are prone to misclassification due to adversarial perturbations pushing their representations toward those of other subgroups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cameron Allen, Aaron Kirtland, Ruo Yu Tao, Sam Lobel, Daniel Scott, Nicholas Petrocelli, Omer Gottesman, Ronald Parr, Michael L. Littman, George Konidaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically rely on the assumption that the environment dynamics and value function can be expressed in terms of a Markovian state representation. However, when state information is only partially observable, how can an agent learn such a state representation, and how can it detect when it has found one? We introduce a metric that can accomplish both objectives, without requiring access to -- or knowledge of -- an underlying, unobservable state space. Our metric, the $\lambda$-discrepancy, is the difference between two distinct temporal difference (TD) value estimates, each computed using TD($\lambda$) with a different value of $\lambda$. Since TD($\lambda{=}0$) makes an implicit Markov assumption and TD($\lambda{=}1$) does not, a discrepancy between these estimates is a potential indicator of a non-Markovian state representation. Indeed, we prove that the $\lambda$-discrepancy is exactly zero for all Markov decision processes and almost always non-zero for a broad class of partially observable environments. We also demonstrate empirically that, once detected, minimizing the $\lambda$-discrepancy can help with learning a memory function to mitigate the corresponding partial observability. We then train a reinforcement learning agent that simultaneously constructs two recurrent value networks with different $\lambda$ parameters and minimizes the difference between them as an auxiliary loss. The approach scales to challenging partially observable domains, where the resulting agent frequently performs significantly better (and never performs worse) than a baseline recurrent agent with only a single value network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Le Ma, Yongsheng Feng, Xin Pan, Yuhang Jin, Kejun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice to another singer's from a reference audio while keeping the original semantics. However, existing SVC methods can hardly perform zero-shot due to incomplete feature disentanglement or dependence on the speaker look-up table. We propose the first open-source high-quality zero-shot SVC model SaMoye that can convert singing to human and non-human timbre. SaMoye disentangles the singing voice's features into content, timbre, and pitch features, where we combine multiple ASR models and compress the content features to reduce timbre leaks. Besides, we enhance the timbre features by unfreezing the speaker encoder and mixing the speaker embedding with top-3 similar speakers. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance, which comprises more than 1,815 hours of pure singing voice and 6,367 speakers. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to find that SaMoye outperforms other models in zero-shot SVC tasks even under extreme conditions like converting singing to animals' timbre. The code and weight of SaMoye are available on https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC. The weights, code, dataset, and documents of SaMoye are publicly available on \url{https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. While contrastive learning has shown promise in self-supervised learning by creating discriminative representations, its application in knowledge distillation remains limited and focuses primarily on discrimination, neglecting the structural relationships captured by the teacher model. To address this limitation, we propose Discriminative and Consistent Distillation (DCD), which employs a contrastive loss along with a consistency regularization to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of teacher and student representations. Our method introduces learnable temperature and bias parameters that adapt during training to balance these complementary objectives, replacing the fixed hyperparameters commonly used in contrastive learning approaches. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC-2012, we demonstrate that DCD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the student model sometimes surpassing the teacher's accuracy. Furthermore, we show that DCD's learned representations exhibit superior cross-dataset generalization when transferred to Tiny ImageNet and STL-10.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Jiang, Chacha Chen, Dang Nguyen, Benjamin M. Mervak, Chenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: GPT-4V's purported strong multimodal abilities raise interests in using it to automate radiology report writing, but there lacks thorough evaluations. In this work, we perform a systematic evaluation of GPT-4V in generating radiology reports on two chest X-ray report datasets: MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray. We attempt to directly generate reports using GPT-4V through different prompting strategies and find that it fails terribly in both lexical metrics and clinical efficacy metrics. To understand the low performance, we decompose the task into two steps: 1) the medical image reasoning step of predicting medical condition labels from images; and 2) the report synthesis step of generating reports from (groundtruth) conditions. We show that GPT-4V's performance in image reasoning is consistently low across different prompts. In fact, the distributions of model-predicted labels remain constant regardless of which groundtruth conditions are present on the image, suggesting that the model is not interpreting chest X-rays meaningfully. Even when given groundtruth conditions in report synthesis, its generated reports are less correct and less natural-sounding than a finetuned LLaMA-2. Altogether, our findings cast doubt on the viability of using GPT-4V in a radiology workflow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhou, Zixuan Zeng, Andi Chen, Xiaofan Zhou, Haowei Ni, Shiyao Zhang, Panfeng Li, Liangxi Liu, Mengyao Zheng, Xupeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian-based methods in the context of 3D scene reconstruction, this study contrasts these modern approaches with traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Wu, Yiming Shi, Jiwei Wei, Chengwei Sun, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address efficiency, identity fidelity, and the preservation of the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, an efficient method that leverages the diffusion model as a hypernetwork to predict personalized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By incorporating these LoRA weights into the off-the-shelf text-to-image model, DiffLoRA enables zero-shot personalization during inference, eliminating the need for post-processing optimization. Moreover, we introduce a novel identity-oriented LoRA weights construction pipeline to facilitate the training process of DiffLoRA. The dataset generated through this pipeline enables DiffLoRA to produce consistently high-quality LoRA weights. Notably, the distinctive properties of the diffusion model enhance the generation of superior weights by employing probabilistic modeling to capture intricate structural patterns and thoroughly explore the weight space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffLoRA outperforms existing personalization approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Xia, Hongwei Lin, Wei Ye, Hai Wu, Yadan Luo, Cheng Wang, Chenglu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based outdoor 3D object detection has received widespread attention. However, training 3D detectors from the LiDAR point cloud typically relies on expensive bounding box annotations. This paper presents SC3D, an innovative label-efficient method requiring only a single coarse click on the bird's eye view of the 3D point cloud for each frame. A key challenge here is the absence of complete geometric descriptions of the target objects from such simple click annotations. To address this issue, our proposed SC3D adopts a progressive pipeline. Initially, we design a mixed pseudo-label generation module that expands limited click annotations into a mixture of bounding box and semantic mask supervision. Next, we propose a mix-supervised teacher model, enabling the detector to learn mixed supervision information. Finally, we introduce a mixed-supervised student network that leverages the teacher model's generalization ability to learn unclicked instances.Experimental results on the widely used nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our SC3D with only coarse clicks, which requires only 0.2% annotation cost, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to weakly-supervised 3D detection methods.The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-GPU nodes are increasingly common in the rapidly evolving landscape of exascale supercomputers. On these systems, GPUs on the same node are connected through dedicated networks, with bandwidths up to a few terabits per second. However, gauging performance expectations and maximizing system efficiency is challenging due to different technologies, design options, and software layers. This paper comprehensively characterizes three supercomputers - Alps, Leonardo, and LUMI - each with a unique architecture and design. We focus on performance evaluation of intra-node and inter-node interconnects on up to 4096 GPUs, using a mix of intra-node and inter-node benchmarks. By analyzing its limitations and opportunities, we aim to offer practical guidance to researchers, system architects, and software developers dealing with multi-GPU supercomputing. Our results show that there is untapped bandwidth, and there are still many opportunities for optimization, ranging from network to software optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabrizio Gilardi, Sabrina Di Lorenzo, Juri Ezzaini, Beryl Santa, Benjamin Streiff, Eric Zurfluh, Emma Hoes</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to its application in many areas, including news media. The integration of AI in journalism presents both opportunities and risks for democracy, making it crucial to understand public reception of and engagement with AI-generated news, as it may directly influence political knowledge and trust. This preregistered study investigates (i) the perceived quality of AI-assisted and AI-generated versus human-generated news articles, (ii) whether disclosure of AI's involvement in generating these news articles influences engagement with them, and (iii) whether such awareness affects the willingness to read AI-generated articles in the future. We employed a between-subjects survey experiment with 599 participants from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, who evaluated the credibility, readability, and expertise of news articles. These articles were either written by journalists (control group), rewritten by AI (AI-assisted group), or entirely generated by AI (AI-generated group). Our results indicate that all news articles, regardless of whether they were written by journalists or AI, were perceived to be of equal quality. When participants in the treatment groups were subsequently made aware of AI's involvement in generating the articles, they expressed a higher willingness to engage with (i.e., continue reading) the articles than participants in the control group. However, they were not more willing to read AI-generated news in the future. These results suggest that aversion to AI usage in news media is not primarily rooted in a perceived lack of quality, and that by disclosing using AI, journalists could attract more immediate engagement with their content, at least in the short term.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a fundamental and long-standing visual task. In this work, we present a novel method, dubbed HMAFlow, to improve optical flow estimation in challenging scenes, particularly those involving small objects. The proposed model mainly consists of two core components: a Hierarchical Motion Field Alignment (HMA) module and a Correlation Self-Attention (CSA) module. In addition, we rebuild 4D cost volumes by employing a Multi-Scale Correlation Search (MCS) layer and replacing average pooling in common cost volumes with a search strategy utilizing multiple search ranges. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the best generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, compared with RAFT, our method achieves relative error reductions of 14.2% and 3.4% on the clean pass and final pass of the Sintel online benchmark, respectively. On the KITTI test benchmark, HMAFlow surpasses RAFT and GMA in the Fl-all metric by relative margins of 6.8% and 7.7%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nayel Fabian Salem, Marcus Nolte, Veronica Haber, Till Menzel, Hans Steege, Robert Graubohm, Markus Maurer</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicles in public traffic that are equipped with Automated Driving Systems are subject to a number of expectations: Among other aspects, their behavior should be safe, conforming to the rules of the road and provide mobility to their users. This poses challenges for the developers of such systems: Developers are responsible for specifying this behavior, for example, in terms of requirements at system design time. As we will discuss in the article, this specification always involves the need for assumptions and trade-offs. As a result, insufficiencies in such a behavior specification can occur that can potentially lead to unsafe system behavior. In order to support the identification of specification insufficiencies, requirements and respective assumptions need to be made explicit. In this article, we propose the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis as an ontology-based approach to specify the behavior for an Automated Driving System equipped vehicle. We use ontologies to formally represent specified behavior for a targeted operational environment, and to establish traceability between specified behavior and the addressed stakeholder needs. Furthermore, we illustrate the application of the Semantic Norm Behavior Analysis in a German legal context with two example scenarios and evaluate our results. Our evaluation shows that the explicit documentation of assumptions in the behavior specification supports both the identification of specification insufficiencies and their treatment. Therefore, this article provides requirements, terminology and an according methodology to facilitate ontology-based behavior specifications in automated driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtao Cao, Zheng Zhang, Hongru Wang, Kam-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has significantly improved the generation of images from textual descriptions. However, existing evaluation metrics do not adequately assess the models' ability to handle a diverse range of textual prompts, which is crucial for their generalizability. To address this, we introduce a new metric called Visual Language Evaluation Understudy (VLEU). VLEU uses large language models to sample from the visual text domain, the set of all possible input texts for T2I models, to generate a wide variety of prompts. The images generated from these prompts are evaluated based on their alignment with the input text using the CLIP model.VLEU quantifies a model's generalizability by computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the marginal distribution of the visual text and the conditional distribution of the images generated by the model. This metric provides a quantitative way to compare different T2I models and track improvements during model finetuning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VLEU in evaluating the generalization capability of various T2I models, positioning it as an essential metric for future research in text-to-image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Xun, Siyuan Liang, Xiaojun Jia, Xinwei Liu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large models for multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, have been widely recognized in the industry as highly susceptible to data-poisoned backdoor attacks. This poses significant risks to downstream model training. In response to such potential threats, finetuning offers a simpler and more efficient defense choice compared to retraining large models with augmented data. In the supervised learning domain, fine-tuning defense strategies can achieve excellent defense performance. However, in the unsupervised and semi-supervised domain, we find that when CLIP faces some complex attack techniques, the existing fine-tuning defense strategy, CleanCLIP, has some limitations on defense performance. The synonym substitution of its text-augmentation is insufficient to enhance the text feature space. To compensate for this weakness, we improve it by proposing a fine-grained \textbf{T}ext \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{C}leaner (TA-Cleaner) to cut off feature connections of backdoor triggers. We randomly select a few samples for positive and negative subtext generation at each epoch of CleanCLIP, and align the subtexts to the images to strengthen the text self-supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our TA-Cleaner against six attack algorithms and conduct comprehensive zero-shot classification tests on ImageNet1K. Our experimental results demonstrate that TA-Cleaner achieves state-of-the-art defensiveness among finetuning-based defense techniques. Even when faced with the novel attack technique BadCLIP, our TA-Cleaner outperforms CleanCLIP by reducing the ASR of Top-1 and Top-10 by 52.02\% and 63.88\%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Erbas, Aporva Amarnath, Vikas Pandey, Karthik Swaminathan, Naigang Wang, Xavier Intes</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the biomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules, providing insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and ligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological processes, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in guided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally demanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing times, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time applications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI using an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with time-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the resource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The limited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient scheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models for low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a queue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task scheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based Seq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through knowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel, reducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels of parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x and 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the Seq2SeqLite model, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojun Chung, Junseo Lee, Minsoo Kim, Dohyeong Kim, Songhwai Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Training agents that are robust to environmental changes remains a significant challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised environment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by generating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities. While prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust policy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment generation. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial environment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed method guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the agent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to further improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion models, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining the diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn a robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming UED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution environments.

However, skip connections in ResNets can lead to gradient overlap, where gradients from both the learned transformation and the skip connection combine, potentially resulting in overestimated gradients. This overestimation can cause inefficiencies in optimization, as some updates may overshoot optimal regions, affecting weight updates. To address this, we examine Z-score Normalization (ZNorm) as a technique to manage gradient overlap. ZNorm adjusts the gradient scale, standardizing gradients across layers and reducing the negative impact of overlapping gradients. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNorm improves training process, especially in non-convex optimization scenarios common in deep learning, where finding optimal solutions is challenging. These findings suggest that ZNorm can affect the gradient flow, enhancing performance in large-scale data processing where accuracy is critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Fragkathoulas, Vasiliki Papanikou, Evaggelia Pitoura, Evimaria Terzi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first graph-based framework for generating group counterfactual explanations to audit model fairness, a crucial aspect of trustworthy machine learning. Counterfactual explanations are instrumental in understanding and mitigating unfairness by revealing how inputs should change to achieve a desired outcome. Our framework, named Feasible Group Counterfactual Explanations (FGCEs), captures real-world feasibility constraints and constructs subgroups with similar counterfactuals, setting it apart from existing methods. It also addresses key trade-offs in counterfactual generation, including the balance between the number of counterfactuals, their associated costs, and the breadth of coverage achieved. To evaluate these trade-offs and assess fairness, we propose measures tailored to group counterfactual generation. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in managing feasibility constraints and trade-offs, as well as the potential of our proposed metrics in identifying and quantifying fairness issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rokas Gipi\v{s}kis, Ayrton San Joaquin, Ze Shen Chin, Adrian Regenfu{\ss}, Ariel Gil, Koen Holtman</p>
<p>Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify both short and long-term risks from newly emerging types of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as available risk management measures. In response, and to support global efforts in regulating AI and writing safety standards, we compile an extensive catalog of risk sources and risk management measures for general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems, complete with descriptions and supporting examples where relevant. This work involves identifying technical, operational, and societal risks across model development, training, and deployment stages, as well as surveying established and experimental methods for managing these risks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to provide extensive documentation of both GPAI risk sources and risk management measures that are descriptive, self-contained and neutral with respect to any existing regulatory framework. This work intends to help AI providers, standards experts, researchers, policymakers, and regulators in identifying and mitigating systemic risks from GPAI systems. For this reason, the catalog is released under a public domain license for ease of direct use by stakeholders in AI governance and standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan He, Ziqian Kong, Zhengyu Chen, Yuling Zhan, Zijun Que, Zhengguo Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) predictions are critical to the safe operation of aero-engines. Currently, the RUL prediction task is mainly a regression paradigm with only mean square error as the loss function and lacks research on feature space structure, the latter of which has shown excellent performance in a large number of studies. This paper develops a multi-granularity supervised contrastive (MGSC) framework from plain intuition that samples with the same RUL label should be aligned in the feature space, and address the problems of too large minibatch size and unbalanced samples in the implementation. The RUL prediction with MGSC is implemented on using the proposed multi-phase training strategy. This paper also demonstrates a simple and scalable basic network structure and validates the proposed MGSC strategy on the CMPASS dataset using a convolutional long short-term memory network as a baseline, which effectively improves the accuracy of RUL prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangfan Yang, Junkai Ji, Shan He, Jianqiang Li, Ruibin Bai, Zexuan Zhu, Yew Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular docking enables virtual screening of compound libraries to identify potential ligands that target proteins of interest, a crucial step in drug development; however, as the size of the compound library increases, the computational complexity of traditional docking models increases. Deep learning algorithms can provide data-driven research and development models to increase the speed of the docking process. Unfortunately, few models can achieve superior screening performance compared to that of traditional models. Therefore, a novel deep learning-based docking approach named Dockformer is introduced in this study. Dockformer leverages multimodal information to capture the geometric topology and structural knowledge of molecules and can directly generate binding conformations with the corresponding confidence measures in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that Dockformer achieves success rates of 90.53\% and 82.71\% on the PDBbind core set and PoseBusters benchmarks, respectively, and more than a 100-fold increase in the inference process speed, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art docking methods. In addition, the ability of Dockformer to identify the main protease inhibitors of coronaviruses is demonstrated in a real-world virtual screening scenario. Considering its high docking accuracy and screening efficiency, Dockformer can be regarded as a powerful and robust tool in the field of drug design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rania Kousovista, Georgina Cosma, Emeka Abakasanga, Ashley Akbari, Francesco Zaccardi, Gyuchan Thomas Jun, Reza Kiani, Satheesh Gangadharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying and understanding the co-occurrence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) is vital for effective healthcare management. These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest characterised circulatory (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) system conditions. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhyeok Jang, Seojin Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Jongheon Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable advances in deep learning have led to the emergence of many off-the-shelf classifiers, e.g., large pre-trained models. However, since they are typically trained on clean data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Despite this vulnerability, their superior performance and transferability make off-the-shelf classifiers still valuable in practice, demanding further work to provide adversarial robustness for them in a post-hoc manner. A recently proposed method, denoised smoothing, leverages a denoiser model in front of the classifier to obtain provable robustness without additional training. However, the denoiser often creates hallucination, i.e., images that have lost the semantics of their originally assigned class, leading to a drop in robustness. Furthermore, its noise-and-denoise procedure introduces a significant distribution shift from the original distribution, causing the denoised smoothing framework to achieve sub-optimal robustness. In this paper, we introduce Fine-Tuning with Confidence-Aware Denoised Image Selection (FT-CADIS), a novel fine-tuning scheme to enhance the certified robustness of off-the-shelf classifiers. FT-CADIS is inspired by the observation that the confidence of off-the-shelf classifiers can effectively identify hallucinated images during denoised smoothing. Based on this, we develop a confidence-aware training objective to handle such hallucinated images and improve the stability of fine-tuning from denoised images. In this way, the classifier can be fine-tuned using only images that are beneficial for adversarial robustness. We also find that such a fine-tuning can be done by updating a small fraction of parameters of the classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FT-CADIS has established the state-of-the-art certified robustness among denoised smoothing methods across all $\ell_2$-adversary radius in various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> No\"el Vouitsis, Rasa Hosseinzadeh, Brendan Leigh Ross, Valentin Villecroze, Satya Krishna Gorti, Jesse C. Cresswell, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem</p>
<p>Abstract: Although diffusion models can generate remarkably high-quality samples, they are intrinsically bottlenecked by their expensive iterative sampling procedure. Consistency models (CMs) have recently emerged as a promising diffusion model distillation method, reducing the cost of sampling by generating high-fidelity samples in just a few iterations. Consistency model distillation aims to solve the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined by an existing diffusion model. CMs are not directly trained to minimize error against an ODE solver, rather they use a more computationally tractable objective. As a way to study how effectively CMs solve the probability flow ODE, and the effect that any induced error has on the quality of generated samples, we introduce Direct CMs, which \textit{directly} minimize this error. Intriguingly, we find that Direct CMs reduce the ODE solving error compared to CMs but also result in significantly worse sample quality, calling into question why exactly CMs work well in the first place.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samantha Dalal, Siobhan Mackenzie Hall, Nari Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: The demands for accurate and representative generative AI systems means there is an increased demand on participatory evaluation structures. While these participatory structures are paramount to to ensure non-dominant values, knowledge and material culture are also reflected in AI models and the media they generate, we argue that dominant structures of community participation in AI development and evaluation are not explicit enough about the benefits and harms that members of socially marginalized groups may experience as a result of their participation. Without explicit interrogation of these benefits by AI developers, as a community we may remain blind to the immensity of systemic change that is needed as well. To support this provocation, we present a speculative case study, developed from our own collective experiences as AI researchers. We use this speculative context to itemize the barriers that need to be overcome in order for the proposed benefits to marginalized communities to be realized, and harms mitigated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toufiq Musah, Prince Ebenezer Adjei, Kojo Obed Otoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and is increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Timely interventions can significantly influence stroke survivability and the quality of life after treatment. However, the standard and most widely available imaging method for confirming strokes and their sub-types, the NCCT, is more challenging and time-consuming to employ in cases of ischemic stroke. For this reason, we developed an automated method for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in NCCTs using the nnU-Net frame work, aimed at enhancing early treatment and improving the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients. We achieved Dice scores of 0.596 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.501 on the sampled dataset. After adjusting for outliers, these scores improved to 0.752 for the Dice score and 0.643 for the IoU. Proper delineation of the region of infarction can help clinicians better assess the potential impact of the infarction, and guide treatment procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Hansen-Palmus, Michael Truong Le, Oliver Hausd\"orfer, Alok Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have pushed the frontier of artificial intelligence but are comprised of hundreds of billions of parameters and operations. For faster inference latency, LLMs are deployed on multiple hardware accelerators through various Model Parallelism strategies. Our paper looks into the details on one such strategy - Tensor Parallel - and proposes to reduce latency by compressing inter-accelerator communication. We leverage fine grained quantization techniques to compress selected activations by 3.5 - 4.5x. Our proposed method leads up to 2x reduction of time-to-first-token (TTFT) with negligible model performance degradation.</p>
