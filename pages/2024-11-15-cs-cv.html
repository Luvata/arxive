<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirabbas Afzali, Borna Khodabandeh, Ali Rasekh, Mahyar JafariNodeh, Sepehr kazemi, Simon Gottschalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning models have demonstrated impressive abilities to capture semantic similarities by aligning representations in the embedding space. However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to generative models to align them with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using Preference Optimization (PO) to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks, commonly seen in contrastive models like CLIP. We further apply our method to disentangle gender understanding and mitigate gender biases, offering a more nuanced control over these sensitive attributes. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method on several vision-language tasks, tackling challenges such as typographic attacks. Additionally, we explore the model's ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jim Buffat, Miguel Pato, Kevin Alonso, Stefan Auer, Emiliano Carmona, Stefan Maier, Rupert M\"uller, Patrick Rademske, Uwe Rascher, Hanno Scharr</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide the first method allowing to retrieve spaceborne SIF maps at 30 m ground resolution with a strong correlation ($r^2=0.6$) to high-quality airborne estimates of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). SIF estimates can provide explanatory information for many tasks related to agricultural management and physiological studies. While SIF products from airborne platforms are accurate and spatially well resolved, the data acquisition of such products remains science-oriented and limited to temporally constrained campaigns. Spaceborne SIF products on the other hand are available globally with often sufficient revisit times. However, the spatial resolution of spaceborne SIF products is too small for agricultural applications. In view of ESA's upcoming FLEX mission we develop a method for SIF retrieval in the O$_2$-A band of hyperspectral DESIS imagery to provide first insights for spaceborne SIF retrieval at high spatial resolution. To this end, we train a simulation-based self-supervised network with a novel perturbation based regularizer and test performance improvements under additional supervised regularization of atmospheric variable prediction. In a validation study with corresponding HyPlant derived SIF estimates at 740 nm we find that our model reaches a mean absolute difference of 0.78 mW / nm / sr / m$^2$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzia Riso, Giuseppe Vecchio, Fabio Pellacini</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the synthesis of materials, textures, and 3D shapes. By conditioning these models via text or images, users can guide the generation, reducing the time required to create digital assets. In this paper, we address the synthesis of structured, stationary patterns, where diffusion models are generally less reliable and, more importantly, less controllable.
  Our approach leverages the generative capabilities of diffusion models specifically adapted for the pattern domain. It enables users to exercise direct control over the synthesis by expanding a partially hand-drawn pattern into a larger design while preserving the structure and details of the input. To enhance pattern quality, we fine-tune an image-pretrained diffusion model on structured patterns using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), apply a noise rolling technique to ensure tileability, and utilize a patch-based approach to facilitate the generation of large-scale assets.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive set of experiments, showing that it outperforms existing models in generating diverse, consistent patterns that respond directly to user input.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08933">Confidence-aware Denoised Fine-tuning of Off-the-shelf Models for Certified Robustness</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhyeok Jang, Seojin Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Jongheon Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable advances in deep learning have led to the emergence of many off-the-shelf classifiers, e.g., large pre-trained models. However, since they are typically trained on clean data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Despite this vulnerability, their superior performance and transferability make off-the-shelf classifiers still valuable in practice, demanding further work to provide adversarial robustness for them in a post-hoc manner. A recently proposed method, denoised smoothing, leverages a denoiser model in front of the classifier to obtain provable robustness without additional training. However, the denoiser often creates hallucination, i.e., images that have lost the semantics of their originally assigned class, leading to a drop in robustness. Furthermore, its noise-and-denoise procedure introduces a significant distribution shift from the original distribution, causing the denoised smoothing framework to achieve sub-optimal robustness. In this paper, we introduce Fine-Tuning with Confidence-Aware Denoised Image Selection (FT-CADIS), a novel fine-tuning scheme to enhance the certified robustness of off-the-shelf classifiers. FT-CADIS is inspired by the observation that the confidence of off-the-shelf classifiers can effectively identify hallucinated images during denoised smoothing. Based on this, we develop a confidence-aware training objective to handle such hallucinated images and improve the stability of fine-tuning from denoised images. In this way, the classifier can be fine-tuned using only images that are beneficial for adversarial robustness. We also find that such a fine-tuning can be done by updating a small fraction of parameters of the classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FT-CADIS has established the state-of-the-art certified robustness among denoised smoothing methods across all $\ell_2$-adversary radius in various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carles Mil\`a, Teodimiro Matsena, Edgar Jamisse, Jovito Nunes, Quique Bassat, Paula Petrone, Elisa Sicuri, Charfudin Sacoor, Cathryn Tonne</p>
<p>Abstract: Many studies have predicted SocioEconomic Position (SEP) for aggregated spatial units such as villages using satellite data, but SEP prediction at the household level and other sources of imagery have not been yet explored. We assembled a dataset of 975 households in a semi-rural district in southern Mozambique, consisting of self-reported asset, expenditure, and income SEP data, as well as multimodal imagery including satellite images and a ground-based photograph survey of 11 household elements. We fine-tuned a convolutional neural network to extract feature vectors from the images, which we then used in regression analyzes to model household SEP using different sets of image types. The best prediction performance was found when modeling asset-based SEP using random forest models with all image types, while the performance for expenditure- and income-based SEP was lower. Using SHAP, we observed clear differences between the images with the largest positive and negative effects, as well as identified the most relevant household elements in the predictions. Finally, we fitted an additional reduced model using only the identified relevant household elements, which had an only slightly lower performance compared to models using all images. Our results show how ground-based household photographs allow to zoom in from an area-level to an individual household prediction while minimizing the data collection effort by using explainable machine learning. The developed workflow can be potentially integrated into routine household surveys, where the collected household imagery could be used for other purposes, such as refined asset characterization and environmental exposure assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Miguel Beir\~ao, Jo\~ao Matos, Tiago Gon\c{c}alves, Camila Kase, Luis Filipe Nakayama, Denise de Freitas, Jaime S. Cardoso</p>
<p>Abstract: Keratitis is an inflammatory corneal condition responsible for 10% of visual impairment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with bacteria, fungi, or amoeba as the most common infection etiologies. While an accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for the selected treatment and the patients' sight outcomes, due to the high cost and limited availability of laboratory diagnostics in LMICs, diagnosis is often made by clinical observation alone, despite its lower accuracy. In this study, we investigate and compare different deep learning approaches to diagnose the source of infection: 1) three separate binary models for infection type predictions; 2) a multitask model with a shared backbone and three parallel classification layers (Multitask V1); and, 3) a multitask model with a shared backbone and a multi-head classification layer (Multitask V2). We used a private Brazilian cornea dataset to conduct the empirical evaluation. We achieved the best results with Multitask V2, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) confidence intervals of 0.7413-0.7740 (bacteria), 0.8395-0.8725 (fungi), and 0.9448-0.9616 (amoeba). A statistical analysis of the impact of patient features on models' performance revealed that sex significantly affects amoeba infection prediction, and age seems to affect fungi and bacteria predictions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08937">Dual-Head Knowledge Distillation: Enhancing Logits Utilization with an Auxiliary Head</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Yang, Chen-Chen Zong, Sheng-Jun Huang, Lei Feng, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional knowledge distillation focuses on aligning the student's predicted probabilities with both ground-truth labels and the teacher's predicted probabilities. However, the transition to predicted probabilities from logits would obscure certain indispensable information. To address this issue, it is intuitive to additionally introduce a logit-level loss function as a supplement to the widely used probability-level loss function, for exploiting the latent information of logits. Unfortunately, we empirically find that the amalgamation of the newly introduced logit-level loss and the previous probability-level loss will lead to performance degeneration, even trailing behind the performance of employing either loss in isolation. We attribute this phenomenon to the collapse of the classification head, which is verified by our theoretical analysis based on the neural collapse theory. Specifically, the gradients of the two loss functions exhibit contradictions in the linear classifier yet display no such conflict within the backbone. Drawing from the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel method called dual-head knowledge distillation, which partitions the linear classifier into two classification heads responsible for different losses, thereby preserving the beneficial effects of both losses on the backbone while eliminating adverse influences on the classification head. Extensive experiments validate that our method can effectively exploit the information inside the logits and achieve superior performance against state-of-the-art counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksym Zhelyeznuyakov, Johannes E. Fr\"och, Shane Colburn, Steven L. Brunton, Arka Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision tasks require processing large amounts of data to perform image classification, segmentation, and feature extraction. Optical preprocessors can potentially reduce the number of floating point operations required by computer vision tasks, enabling low-power and low-latency operation. However, existing optical preprocessors are mostly learned and hence strongly depend on the training data, and thus lack universal applicability. In this paper, we present a metaoptic imager, which implements the Radon transform obviating the need for training the optics. High quality image reconstruction with a large compression ratio of 0.6% is presented through the use of the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique. Image classification with 90% accuracy is presented on an experimentally measured Radon dataset through neural network trained on digitally transformed images.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09007">Scale Contrastive Learning with Selective Attentions for Blind Image Quality Assessment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Huang, Xudong Li, Bohan Fu, Xiaohui Chu, Ke Li, Yunhang Shen, Yan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) serves as a fundamental task in computer vision, yet it often fails to consistently align with human subjective perception. Recent advances show that multi-scale evaluation strategies are promising due to their ability to replicate the hierarchical structure of human vision. However, the effectiveness of these strategies is limited by a lack of understanding of how different image scales influence perceived quality. This paper addresses two primary challenges: the significant redundancy of information across different scales, and the confusion caused by combining features from these scales, which may vary widely in quality. To this end, a new multi-scale BIQA framework is proposed, namely Contrast-Constrained Scale-Focused IQA Framework (CSFIQA). CSFIQA features a selective focus attention mechanism to minimize information redundancy and highlight critical quality-related information. Additionally, CSFIQA includes a scale-level contrastive learning module equipped with a noise sample matching mechanism to identify quality discrepancies across the same image content at different scales. By exploring the intrinsic relationship between image scales and the perceived quality, the proposed CSFIQA achieves leading performance on eight benchmark datasets, e.g., achieving SRCC values of 0.967 (versus 0.947 in CSIQ) and 0.905 (versus 0.876 in LIVEC).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09018">Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Yanuka, Assaf Ben Kish, Yonatan Bitton, Idan Szpektor, Raja Giryes</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuming Zhang, Xingfa Gu, Qingjiu Tian, Lorenzo Bruzzone</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving hyperspectral image (HSI) semantic segmentation by exploiting complementary information from a supplementary data type (referred to X-modality) is promising but challenging due to differences in imaging sensors, image content, and resolution. Current techniques struggle to enhance modality-specific and modality-shared information, as well as to capture dynamic interaction and fusion between different modalities. In response, this study proposes CoMiX, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with deformable convolutions (DCNs) for HSI-X semantic segmentation. CoMiX is designed to extract, calibrate, and fuse information from HSI and X data. Its pipeline includes an encoder with two parallel and interacting backbones and a lightweight all-multilayer perceptron (ALL-MLP) decoder. The encoder consists of four stages, each incorporating 2D DCN blocks for the X model to accommodate geometric variations and 3D DCN blocks for HSIs to adaptively aggregate spatial-spectral features. Additionally, each stage includes a Cross-Modality Feature enhancement and eXchange (CMFeX) module and a feature fusion module (FFM). CMFeX is designed to exploit spatial-spectral correlations from different modalities to recalibrate and enhance modality-specific and modality-shared features while adaptively exchanging complementary information between them. Outputs from CMFeX are fed into the FFM for fusion and passed to the next stage for further information learning. Finally, the outputs from each FFM are integrated by the ALL-MLP decoder for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoMiX achieves superior performance and generalizes well to various multimodal recognition tasks. The CoMiX code will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) for musical performances is a long standing problem in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Visual piano transcription (VPT) is a multimodal subproblem of AMT which focuses on extracting a symbolic representation of a piano performance from visual information only (e.g., from a top-down video of the piano keyboard). Inspired by the success of Transformers for audio-based AMT, as well as their recent successes in other computer vision tasks, in this paper we present a Transformer based architecture for VPT. The proposed VPT system combines a piano bounding box detection model with an onset and pitch detection model, allowing our system to perform well in more naturalistic conditions like imperfect image crops around the piano and slightly tilted images.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09062">Multimodal Object Detection using Depth and Image Data for Manufacturing Parts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nazanin Mahjourian, Vinh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mariusz Wisniewski, Zeeshan A. Rana, Ivan Petrunin, Alan Holt, Stephen Harman</p>
<p>Abstract: Drone detection has benefited from improvements in deep neural networks, but like many other applications, suffers from the availability of accurate data for training. Synthetic data provides a potential for low-cost data generation and has been shown to improve data availability and quality. However, models trained on synthetic datasets need to prove their ability to perform on real-world data, known as the problem of sim-to-real transferability. Here, we present a drone detection Faster-RCNN model trained on a purely synthetic dataset that transfers to real-world data. We found that it achieves an AP_50 of 97.0% when evaluated on the MAV-Vid - a real dataset of flying drones - compared with 97.8% for an equivalent model trained on real-world data. Our results show that using synthetic data for drone detection has the potential to reduce data collection costs and improve labelling quality. These findings could be a starting point for more elaborate synthetic drone datasets. For example, realistic recreations of specific scenarios could de-risk the dataset generation of safety-critical applications such as the detection of drones at airports. Further, synthetic data may enable reliable drone detection systems, which could benefit other areas, such as unmanned traffic management systems.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09101">Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashim Dahal, Saydul Akbar Murad, Nick Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have done particularly well in the field of image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has emerged to accelerate with the inception of the new architecture, with over 80\% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset being either based on the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID. The experimental results observed during the course of the research were under the scrutinization of the following objectives: 1. Use of weighted fused loss function for the maximum mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score, Dice score, and minimization or conservation of entropy or class representation, 2. Comparison of transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against generic UNet Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) judged over mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time, and 3. What do we lose for what we gain? i.e., the comparison of the two models against current state-of-art segmentation models. We show the use of the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance capacities as compared to transfer learning the ViT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglin Li, Qianglong Chen, Zhi Li, Feng Tao, Yin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) have driven the development of benchmarks designed to assess cognitive abilities in video-based tasks. However, most existing benchmarks heavily rely on web-collected videos paired with human annotations or model-generated questions, which limit control over the video content and fall short in evaluating advanced cognitive abilities involving symbolic elements and abstract concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce VCBench, a controllable benchmark to assess LVLMs' cognitive abilities, involving symbolic and abstract concepts at varying difficulty levels. By generating video data with the Python-based engine, VCBench allows for precise control over the video content, creating dynamic, task-oriented videos that feature complex scenes and abstract concepts. Each task pairs with tailored question templates that target specific cognitive challenges, providing a rigorous evaluation test. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as Qwen2-VL-72B, struggle with simple video cognition tasks involving abstract concepts, with performance sharply dropping by 19% as video complexity rises. These findings reveal the current limitations of LVLMs in advanced cognitive tasks and highlight the critical role of VCBench in driving research toward more robust LVLMs for complex video cognition challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Guo, Mohan Kankanhalli</p>
<p>Abstract: While contrastive pre-training is widely employed, its data efficiency problem has remained relatively under-explored thus far. Existing methods often rely on static coreset selection algorithms to pre-identify important data for training. However, this static nature renders them unable to dynamically track the data usefulness throughout pre-training, leading to subpar pre-trained models. To address this challenge, our paper introduces a novel dynamic bootstrapping dataset pruning method. It involves pruning data preparation followed by dataset mutation operations, both of which undergo iterative and dynamic updates. We apply this method to two prevalent contrastive pre-training frameworks: \textbf{CLIP} and \textbf{MoCo}, representing vision-language and vision-centric domains, respectively. In particular, we individually pre-train seven CLIP models on two large-scale image-text pair datasets, and two MoCo models on the ImageNet dataset, resulting in a total of 16 pre-trained models. With a data pruning rate of 30-35\% across all 16 models, our method exhibits only marginal performance degradation (less than \textbf{1\%} on average) compared to corresponding models trained on the full dataset counterparts across various downstream datasets, and also surpasses several baselines with a large performance margin. Additionally, the byproduct from our method, \ie coresets derived from the original datasets after pre-training, also demonstrates significant superiority in terms of downstream performance over other static coreset selection approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gozde Merve Demirci, Jiachen Yao, Ming-Chih Ho, Xiaoling Hu, Wei-Chi Wu, Chao Chen, Chia-Ling Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of retinal images plays a crucial role in aiding ophthalmologists in diagnosing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and assessing its severity. However, due to their underdeveloped, thinner vessels, manual annotation in infant fundus images is very complex, and this presents challenges for fully supervised learning. To address the scarcity of annotations, we propose a semi supervised segmentation framework designed to advance ROP studies without the need for extensive manual vessel annotation. Unlike previous methods that rely solely on limited labeled data, our approach leverages teacher student learning by integrating two powerful components: an uncertainty weighted vessel unveiling module and domain adversarial learning. The vessel unveiling module helps the model effectively reveal obscured and hard to detect vessel structures, while adversarial training aligns feature representations across different domains, ensuring robust and generalizable vessel segmentations. We validate our approach on public datasets (CHASEDB, STARE) and an in-house ROP dataset, demonstrating its superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, we extend the model's utility to a downstream task of ROP multi-stage classification, where vessel masks extracted by our segmentation model improve diagnostic accuracy. The promising results in classification underscore the model's potential for clinical application, particularly in early-stage ROP diagnosis and intervention. Overall, our work offers a scalable solution for leveraging unlabeled data in pediatric ophthalmology, opening new avenues for biomarker discovery and clinical research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengbo Yuan, Geng Chen, Li Yi, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric Hand Object Interaction (HOI) videos provide valuable insights into human interactions with the physical world, attracting growing interest from the computer vision and robotics communities. A key task in fully understanding the geometry and dynamics of HOI scenes is dense pointclouds sequence reconstruction. However, the inherent motion of both hands and the camera makes this challenging. Current methods often rely on time-consuming test-time optimization, making them impractical for reconstructing internet-scale videos. To address this, we introduce UniHOI, a model that unifies the estimation of all variables necessary for dense 4D reconstruction, including camera intrinsic, camera poses, and video depth, for egocentric HOI scene in a fast feed-forward manner. We end-to-end optimize all these variables to improve their consistency in 3D space. Furthermore, our model could be trained solely on large-scale monocular video dataset, overcoming the limitation of scarce labeled HOI data. We evaluate UniHOI with both in-domain and zero-shot generalization setting, surpassing all baselines in pointclouds sequence reconstruction and long-term 3D scene flow recovery. UniHOI is the first approach to offer fast, dense, and generalizable monocular egocentric HOI scene reconstruction in the presence of motion. Code and trained model will be released in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuran Wang, Yingping Liang, Hesong Li, Ying Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The generalization and performance of stereo matching networks are limited due to the domain gap of the existing synthetic datasets and the sparseness of GT labels in the real datasets. In contrast, monocular depth estimation has achieved significant advancements, benefiting from large-scale depth datasets and self-supervised strategies. To bridge the performance gap between monocular depth estimation and stereo matching, we propose leveraging monocular knowledge transfer to enhance stereo matching, namely Mono2Stereo. We introduce knowledge transfer with a two-stage training process, comprising synthetic data pre-training and real-world data fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we design a data generation pipeline that synthesizes stereo training data from monocular images. This pipeline utilizes monocular depth for warping and novel view synthesis and employs our proposed Edge-Aware (EA) inpainting module to fill in missing contents in the generated images. In the fine-tuning stage, we introduce a Sparse-to-Dense Knowledge Distillation (S2DKD) strategy encouraging the distributions of predictions to align with dense monocular depths. This strategy mitigates issues with edge blurring in sparse real-world labels and enhances overall consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our pre-trained model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. Furthermore, domain-specific fine-tuning using our pre-trained model and S2DKD strategy significantly increments in-domain performance. The code will be made available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youpeng Wen, Junfan Lin, Yi Zhu, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Shen Zhao, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements utilizing large-scale video data for learning video generation models demonstrate significant potential in understanding complex physical dynamics. It suggests the feasibility of leveraging diverse robot trajectory data to develop a unified, dynamics-aware model to enhance robot manipulation. However, given the relatively small amount of available robot data, directly fitting data without considering the relationship between visual observations and actions could lead to suboptimal data utilization. To this end, we propose VidMan (Video Diffusion for Robot Manipulation), a novel framework that employs a two-stage training mechanism inspired by dual-process theory from neuroscience to enhance stability and improve data utilization efficiency. Specifically, in the first stage, VidMan is pre-trained on the Open X-Embodiment dataset (OXE) for predicting future visual trajectories in a video denoising diffusion manner, enabling the model to develop a long horizontal awareness of the environment's dynamics. In the second stage, a flexible yet effective layer-wise self-attention adapter is introduced to transform VidMan into an efficient inverse dynamics model that predicts action modulated by the implicit dynamics knowledge via parameter sharing. Our VidMan framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline model GR-1 on the CALVIN benchmark, achieving a 11.7% relative improvement, and demonstrates over 9% precision gains on the OXE small-scale dataset. These results provide compelling evidence that world models can significantly enhance the precision of robot action prediction. Codes and models will be public.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengchao Zhao, Yundong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which lead to high-quality novel view synthesis and accelerated rendering, have remarkably improved the quality of radiance field reconstruction. However, the extraction of mesh from a massive number of minute 3D Gaussian points remains great challenge due to the large volume of Gaussians and difficulty of representation of sharp signals caused by their inherent low-pass characteristics. To address this issue, we propose DyGASR, which utilizes generalized exponential function instead of traditional 3D Gaussian to decrease the number of particles and dynamically optimize the representation of the captured signal. In addition, it is observed that reconstructing mesh with Generalized Exponential Splatting(GES) without modifications frequently leads to failures since the generalized exponential distribution centroids may not precisely align with the scene surface. To overcome this, we adopt Sugar's approach and introduce Generalized Surface Regularization (GSR), which reduces the smallest scaling vector of each point cloud to zero and ensures normal alignment perpendicular to the surface, facilitating subsequent Poisson surface mesh reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a dynamic resolution adjustment strategy that utilizes a cosine schedule to gradually increase image resolution from low to high during the training stage, thus avoiding constant full resolution, which significantly boosts the reconstruction speed. Our approach surpasses existing 3DGS-based mesh reconstruction methods, as evidenced by extensive evaluations on various scene datasets, demonstrating a 25\% increase in speed, and a 30\% reduction in memory usage.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09174">Advancing Diffusion Models: Alias-Free Resampling and Enhanced Rotational Equivariance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Fahim Anjum</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, particularly via diffusion models, have led to impressive improvements in image synthesis quality. Despite this, diffusion models are still challenged by model-induced artifacts and limited stability in image fidelity. In this work, we hypothesize that the primary cause of this issue is the improper resampling operation that introduces aliasing in the diffusion model and a careful alias-free resampling dictated by image processing theory can improve the model's performance in image synthesis. We propose the integration of alias-free resampling layers into the UNet architecture of diffusion models without adding extra trainable parameters, thereby maintaining computational efficiency. We then assess whether these theory-driven modifications enhance image quality and rotational equivariance. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and MNIST-M, reveal consistent gains in image quality, particularly in terms of FID and KID scores. Furthermore, we propose a modified diffusion process that enables user-controlled rotation of generated images without requiring additional training. Our findings highlight the potential of theory-driven enhancements such as alias-free resampling in generative models to improve image quality while maintaining model efficiency and pioneer future research directions to incorporate them into video-generating diffusion models, enabling deeper exploration of the applications of alias-free resampling in generative modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drone-captured images present significant challenges in object detection due to varying shooting conditions, which can alter object appearance and shape. Factors such as drone altitude, angle, and weather cause these variations, influencing the performance of object detection algorithms.

Furthermore, we streamline the training process with a one-step approach, updating the learnable prompt concurrently with model training, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance. Our study contributes to domain-generalized object detection by leveraging learnable prompts and optimizing training processes. This enhances model robustness and adaptability across diverse environments, leading to more effective aerial object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Cao, Sheng Shi, Jun Zhao, Yang Yao, Jintao Fei, Minyu Gao, Guoxin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation has made significant advances with diffusion-based models, improving video quality and lipsync accuracy. However, the increasing complexity of these models has led to inefficiencies in training and inference, as well as constraints on video length and inter-frame continuity. In this paper, we propose JoyVASA, a diffusion-based method for generating facial dynamics and head motion in audio-driven facial animation. Specifically, in the first stage, we introduce a decoupled facial representation framework that separates dynamic facial expressions from static 3D facial representations. This decoupling allows the system to generate longer videos by combining any static 3D facial representation with dynamic motion sequences. Then, in the second stage, a diffusion transformer is trained to generate motion sequences directly from audio cues, independent of character identity. Finally, a generator trained in the first stage uses the 3D facial representation and the generated motion sequences as inputs to render high-quality animations. With the decoupled facial representation and the identity-independent motion generation process, JoyVASA extends beyond human portraits to animate animal faces seamlessly. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset of private Chinese and public English data, enabling multilingual support. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Future work will focus on improving real-time performance and refining expression control, further expanding the applications in portrait animation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09219">Harnessing Vision Foundation Models for High-Performance, Training-Free Open Vocabulary Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Shi, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has advanced open-vocabulary predictions, its performance on semantic segmentation remains suboptimal. This shortfall primarily stems from its spatial-invariant semantic features and constrained resolution. While previous adaptations addressed spatial invariance semantic by modifying the self-attention in CLIP's image encoder, the issue of limited resolution remains unexplored. Different from previous segment-then-splice methods that segment sub-images via a sliding window and splice the results, we introduce a splice-then-segment paradigm that incorporates Segment-Anything Model (SAM) to tackle the resolution issue since SAM excels at extracting fine-grained semantic correlations from high-resolution images. Specifically, we introduce Trident, a training-free framework that first splices features extracted by CLIP and DINO from sub-images, then leverages SAM's encoder to create a correlation matrix for global aggregation, enabling a broadened receptive field for effective segmentation. Besides, we propose a refinement strategy for CLIP's coarse segmentation outputs by transforming them into prompts for SAM, further enhancing the segmentation performance. Trident achieves a significant improvement in the mIoU across eight benchmarks compared with the current SOTA, increasing from 44.4 to 48.6.Code is available at https://github.com/YuHengsss/Trident.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dunwei Tu, Huiyu Yi, Tieyi Zhang, Ruotong Li, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes from only a few samples without forgetting previous ones, requiring intelligent agents to adapt to dynamic environments. FSCIL combines the characteristics and challenges of class-incremental learning and few-shot learning: (i) Current classes occupy the entire feature space, which is detrimental to learning new classes. (ii) The small number of samples in incremental rounds is insufficient for fully training. In existing mainstream virtual class methods, for addressing the challenge (i), they attempt to use virtual classes as placeholders. However, new classes may not necessarily align with the virtual classes. For the challenge (ii), they replace trainable fully connected layers with Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifiers based on cosine similarity, but NCM classifiers do not account for sample imbalance issues. To address these issues in previous methods, we propose the class-center guided embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm joint classifiers (SAAN) learning framework, which provides balanced space for all classes and leverages norm differences caused by sample imbalance to enhance classification criteria. Specifically, for challenge (i), SAAN divides the feature space into multiple subspaces and allocates a dedicated subspace for each session by guiding samples with the pre-set category centers. For challenge (ii), SAAN establishes a norm distribution for each class and generates angle-norm joint logits. Experiments demonstrate that SAAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance and it can be directly embedded into other SOTA methods as a plug-in, further enhancing their performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal foundation models has led to significant advancements in cross-modal understanding and generation across diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video. However, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can bypass built-in safety mechanisms and induce the production of potentially harmful content. Consequently, understanding the methods of jailbreak attacks and existing defense mechanisms is essential to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal generative models in real-world scenarios, particularly in security-sensitive applications. To provide comprehensive insight into this topic, this survey reviews jailbreak and defense in multimodal generative models. First, given the generalized lifecycle of multimodal jailbreak, we systematically explore attacks and corresponding defense strategies across four levels: input, encoder, generator, and output. Based on this analysis, we present a detailed taxonomy of attack methods, defense mechanisms, and evaluation frameworks specific to multimodal generative models. Additionally, we cover a wide range of input-output configurations, including modalities such as Any-to-Text, Any-to-Vision, and Any-to-Any within generative systems. Finally, we highlight current research challenges and propose potential directions for future research.The open-source repository corresponding to this work can be found at https://github.com/liuxuannan/Awesome-Multimodal-Jailbreak.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhou, Wenquan Feng, Shuchang Lyu, Guangliang Cheng, Xiaowei Huang, Qi Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset Distillation (DD) is an emerging technique that compresses large-scale datasets into significantly smaller synthesized datasets while preserving high test performance and enabling the efficient training of large models. However, current research primarily focuses on enhancing evaluation accuracy under limited compression ratios, often overlooking critical security concerns such as adversarial robustness. A key challenge in evaluating this robustness lies in the complex interactions between distillation methods, model architectures, and adversarial attack strategies, which complicate standardized assessments. To address this, we introduce BEARD, an open and unified benchmark designed to systematically assess the adversarial robustness of DD methods, including DM, IDM, and BACON. BEARD encompasses a variety of adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C&W) on distilled datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and TinyImageNet. Utilizing an adversarial game framework, it introduces three key metrics: Robustness Ratio (RR), Attack Efficiency Ratio (AE), and Comprehensive Robustness-Efficiency Index (CREI). Our analysis includes unified benchmarks, various Images Per Class (IPC) settings, and the effects of adversarial training. Results are available on the BEARD Leaderboard, along with a library providing model and dataset pools to support reproducible research. Access the code at BEARD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal deepfakes involving audiovisual manipulations are a growing threat because they are difficult to detect with the naked eye or using unimodal deep learningbased forgery detection methods. Audiovisual forensic models, while more capable than unimodal models, require large training datasets and are computationally expensive for training and inference. Furthermore, these models lack interpretability and often do not generalize well to unseen manipulations. In this study, we examine the detection capabilities of a large language model (LLM) (i.e., ChatGPT) to identify and account for any possible visual and auditory artifacts and manipulations in audiovisual deepfake content. Extensive experiments are conducted on videos from a benchmark multimodal deepfake dataset to evaluate the detection performance of ChatGPT and compare it with the detection capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal forensic models and humans. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of domain knowledge and prompt engineering for video forgery detection tasks using LLMs. Unlike approaches based on end-to-end learning, ChatGPT can account for spatial and spatiotemporal artifacts and inconsistencies that may exist within or across modalities. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of ChatGPT for multimedia forensic tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: While existing one-shot talking head generation models have achieved progress in coarse-grained emotion editing, there is still a lack of fine-grained emotion editing models with high interpretability. We argue that for an approach to be considered fine-grained, it needs to provide clear definitions and sufficiently detailed differentiation. We present LES-Talker, a novel one-shot talking head generation model with high interpretability, to achieve fine-grained emotion editing across emotion types, emotion levels, and facial units. We propose a Linear Emotion Space (LES) definition based on Facial Action Units to characterize emotion transformations as vector transformations. We design the Cross-Dimension Attention Net (CDAN) to deeply mine the correlation between LES representation and 3D model representation. Through mining multiple relationships across different feature and structure dimensions, we enable LES representation to guide the controllable deformation of 3D model. In order to adapt the multimodal data with deviations to the LES and enhance visual quality, we utilize specialized network design and training strategies. Experiments show that our method provides high visual quality along with multilevel and interpretable fine-grained emotion editing, outperforming mainstream methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Wang, Wenjie An, Kui Jiang, Xianming Liu, Junjun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing face super-resolution (FSR) methods have made significant advancements, but they primarily super-resolve face with limited visual information, original pixel-wise space in particular, commonly overlooking the pluralistic clues, like the higher-order depth and semantics, as well as non-visual inputs (text caption and description). Consequently, these methods struggle to produce a unified and meaningful representation from the input face. We suppose that introducing the language-vision pluralistic representation into unexplored potential embedding space could enhance FSR by encoding and exploiting the complementarity across language-vision prior. This motivates us to propose a new framework called LLV-FSR, which marries the power of large vision-language model and higher-order visual prior with the challenging task of FSR. Specifically, besides directly absorbing knowledge from original input, we introduce the pre-trained vision-language model to generate pluralistic priors, involving the image caption, descriptions, face semantic mask and depths. These priors are then employed to guide the more critical feature representation, facilitating realistic and high-quality face super-resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves both the reconstruction quality and perceptual quality, surpassing the SOTA by 0.43dB in terms of PSNR on the MMCelebA-HQ dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatically and rapidly understanding Earth's surface is fundamental to our grasp of the living environment and informed decision-making. This underscores the need for a unified system with comprehensive capabilities in analyzing Earth's surface to address a wide range of human needs. The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has great potential in boosting the efficiency and convenience of intelligent Earth observation. These models can engage in human-like conversations, serve as unified platforms for understanding images, follow diverse instructions, and provide insightful feedbacks. In this study, we introduce LHRS-Bot-Nova, an MLLM specialized in understanding remote sensing (RS) images, designed to expertly perform a wide range of RS understanding tasks aligned with human instructions. LHRS-Bot-Nova features an enhanced vision encoder and a novel bridge layer, enabling efficient visual compression and better language-vision alignment. To further enhance RS-oriented vision-language alignment, we propose a large-scale RS image-caption dataset, generated through feature-guided image recaptioning. Additionally, we introduce an instruction dataset specifically designed to improve spatial recognition abilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aldo Marzullo, Marta Bianca Maria Ranzini</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) offers potential for identifying anomalies in medical imaging without task-specific training. In this paper, we evaluate CLIP-based models, originally developed for industrial tasks, on brain tumor detection using the BraTS-MET dataset. Our analysis examines their ability to detect medical-specific anomalies with no or minimal supervision, addressing the challenges posed by limited data annotation. While these models show promise in transferring general knowledge to medical tasks, their performance falls short of the precision required for clinical use. Our findings highlight the need for further adaptation before CLIP-based models can be reliably applied to medical anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Ye, Haodong Chen, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) involves the acquisition of data about objects or areas from a distance, primarily to monitor environmental changes, manage resources, and support planning and disaster response. A significant challenge in RS segmentation is the scarcity of high-quality labeled images due to the diversity and complexity of RS image, which makes pixel-level annotation difficult and hinders the development of effective supervised segmentation algorithms. To solve this problem, we propose Adaptively Augmented Consistency Learning (AACL), a semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to enhances RS segmentation accuracy under condictions of limited labeled data. AACL extracts additional information embedded in unlabeled images through the use of Uniform Strength Augmentation (USAug) and Adaptive Cut-Mix (AdaCM). Evaluations across various RS datasets demonstrate that AACL achieves competitive performance in semi-supervised segmentation, showing up to a 20% improvement in specific categories and 2% increase in overall performance compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zepeng Huo, Jason Alan Fries, Alejandro Lozano, Jeya Maria Jose Valanarasu, Ethan Steinberg, Louis Blankemeier, Akshay S. Chaudhari, Curtis Langlotz, Nigam H. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of medical foundation models and the growing availability of imaging data, scalable pretraining techniques offer a promising way to identify imaging biomarkers predictive of future disease risk. While current self-supervised methods for 3D medical imaging models capture local structural features like organ morphology, they fail to link pixel biomarkers with long-term health outcomes due to a missing context problem. Current approaches lack the temporal context necessary to identify biomarkers correlated with disease progression, as they rely on supervision derived only from images and concurrent text descriptions. To address this, we introduce time-to-event pretraining, a pretraining framework for 3D medical imaging models that leverages large-scale temporal supervision from paired, longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Using a dataset of 18,945 CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) and time-to-event distributions across thousands of EHR-derived tasks, our method improves outcome prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell's C-index across 8 benchmark tasks. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing diagnostic classification performance. This study lays the foundation for integrating longitudinal EHR and 3D imaging data to advance clinical risk prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwei Yu, I-Ming Chen, Jing Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In construction quality monitoring, accurately detecting and segmenting cracks in concrete structures is paramount for safety and maintenance. Current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in crack segmentation tasks, yet they often struggle with complex backgrounds and fail to capture fine-grained tubular structures fully. In contrast, Transformers excel at capturing global context but lack precision in detailed feature extraction. We introduce DSCformer, a novel hybrid model that integrates an enhanced Dynamic Snake Convolution (DSConv) with a Transformer architecture for crack segmentation to address these challenges. Our key contributions include the enhanced DSConv through a pyramid kernel for adaptive offset computation and a simultaneous bi-directional learnable offset iteration, significantly improving the model's performance to capture intricate crack patterns. Additionally, we propose a Weighted Convolutional Attention Module (WCAM), which refines channel attention, allowing for more precise and adaptive feature attention. We evaluate DSCformer on the Crack3238 and FIND datasets, achieving IoUs of 59.22\% and 87.24\%, respectively. The experimental results suggest that our DSCformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengyi Yang, Yafei Zhang, Huafeng Li, Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary value of infrared and visible image fusion technology lies in applying the fusion results to downstream tasks. However, existing methods face challenges such as increased training complexity and significantly compromised performance of individual tasks when addressing multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. To tackle this, we propose Task-Oriented Adaptive Regulation (T-OAR), an adaptive mechanism specifically designed for multi-task environments. Additionally, we introduce the Task-related Dynamic Prompt Injection (T-DPI) module, which generates task-specific dynamic prompts from user-input text instructions and integrates them into target representations. This guides the feature extraction module to produce representations that are more closely aligned with the specific requirements of downstream tasks. By incorporating the T-DPI module into the T-OAR framework, our approach generates fusion images tailored to task-specific requirements without the need for separate training or task-specific weights. This not only reduces computational costs but also enhances adaptability and performance across multiple tasks. Experimental results show that our method excels in object detection, semantic segmentation, and salient object detection, demonstrating its strong adaptability, flexibility, and task specificity. This provides an efficient solution for image fusion in multi-task environments, highlighting the technology's potential across diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahd Qureshi, Shayaan Chaudhry, Sana Jabba, Murtaza Taj</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating building height from satellite imagery poses significant challenges, especially when monocular images are employed, resulting in a loss of essential 3D information during imaging. This loss of spatial depth further complicates the height estimation process. We addressed this issue by using shadow length as an additional cue to compensate for the loss of building height estimation using single-view imagery. We proposed a novel method that first localized a building and its shadow in the given satellite image. After localization, the shadow length is estimated using a regression model. To estimate the final height of each building, we utilize the principles of photogrammetry, specifically considering the relationship between the solar elevation angle, the vertical edge length of the building, and the length of the building's shadow. For the localization of buildings in our model, we utilized a modified YOLOv7 detector, and to regress the shadow length for each building we utilized the ResNet18 as backbone architecture. Finally, we estimated the associated building height using solar elevation with shadow length through analytical formulation. We evaluated our method on 42 different cities and the results showed that the proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods with a suitable margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxing Liu, Yueran Pan, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Observing and analyzing children's social behaviors is crucial for the early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This work focuses on automatically detecting ASD using computer vision techniques and large language models (LLMs). Existing methods typically rely on supervised learning. However, the scarcity of ASD diagnostic datasets and the lack of interpretability in diagnostic results significantly limits its clinical application. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel unsupervised approach based on script-centric behavior understanding. Our pipeline converts video content into scripts that describe the behavior of characters, leveraging the generalizability of large language models to detect ASD in a zero-shot or few-shot manner. Specifically, we propose a scripts transcription module for multimodal behavior data textualization and a domain prompts module to bridge LLMs. Our method achieves an accuracy of 92.00\% in diagnosing ASD in children with an average age of 24 months, surpassing the performance of supervised learning methods by 3.58\% absolutely. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach and suggest its potential for advancing ASD research through LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shravan Venkatraman, Jaskaran Singh Walia, Joe Dhanith P R</p>
<p>Abstract: Image classification is a computer vision task where a model analyzes an image to categorize it into a specific label. Vision Transformers (ViT) improve this task by leveraging self-attention to capture complex patterns and long range relationships between image patches. However, a key challenge for ViTs is efficiently incorporating multiscale feature representations, which is inherent in CNNs through their hierarchical structure. In this paper, we introduce the Scale-Aware Graph Attention Vision Transformer (SAG-ViT), a novel framework that addresses this challenge by integrating multi-scale features. Using EfficientNet as a backbone, the model extracts multi-scale feature maps, which are divided into patches to preserve semantic information. These patches are organized into a graph based on spatial and feature similarities, with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) refining the node embeddings. Finally, a Transformer encoder captures long-range dependencies and complex interactions. The SAG-ViT is evaluated on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing image classification performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Mediffusion -- a new method for semi-supervised learning with explainable classification based on a joint diffusion model. The medical imaging domain faces unique challenges due to scarce data labelling -- insufficient for standard training, and critical nature of the applications that require high performance, confidence, and explainability of the models. In this work, we propose to tackle those challenges with a single model that combines standard classification with a diffusion-based generative task in a single shared parametrisation. By sharing representations, our model effectively learns from both labeled and unlabeled data while at the same time providing accurate explanations through counterfactual examples. In our experiments, we show that our Mediffusion achieves results comparable to recent semi-supervised methods while providing more reliable and precise explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Reusable Motion prior (ReMP), an effective motion prior that can accurately track the temporal evolution of motion in various downstream tasks. Inspired by the success of foundation models, we argue that a robust spatio-temporal motion prior can encapsulate underlying 3D dynamics applicable to various sensor modalities. We learn the rich motion prior from a sequence of complete parametric models of posed human body shape. Our prior can easily estimate poses in missing frames or noisy measurements despite significant occlusion by employing a temporal attention mechanism. More interestingly, our prior can guide the system with incomplete and challenging input measurements to quickly extract critical information to estimate the sequence of poses, significantly improving the training efficiency for mesh sequence recovery. ReMP consistently outperforms the baseline method on diverse and practical 3D motion data, including depth point clouds, LiDAR scans, and IMU sensor data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxiang Lai, Jie Zhang, Jun Liu, Jian Li, Xiaocheng Lu, Song Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged as an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of various modalities. However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents, and an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates the learning of the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG task in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chutian Meng, Fan Ma, Jiaxu Miao, Chi Zhang, Yi Yang, Yueting Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revitalized the image generation domain, playing crucial roles in both academic research and artistic expression. With the emergence of new diffusion models, assessing the performance of text-to-image models has become increasingly important. Current metrics focus on directly matching the input text with the generated image, but due to cross-modal information asymmetry, this leads to unreliable or incomplete assessment results. Motivated by this, we introduce the Image Regeneration task in this study to assess text-to-image models by tasking the T2I model with generating an image according to the reference image. We use GPT4V to bridge the gap between the reference image and the text input for the T2I model, allowing T2I models to understand image content. This evaluation process is simplified as comparisons between the generated image and the reference image are straightforward. Two regeneration datasets spanning content-diverse and style-diverse evaluation dataset are introduced to evaluate the leading diffusion models currently available. Additionally, we present ImageRepainter framework to enhance the quality of generated images by improving content comprehension via MLLM guided iterative generation and revision. Our comprehensive experiments have showcased the effectiveness of this framework in assessing the generative capabilities of models. By leveraging MLLM, we have demonstrated that a robust T2M can produce images more closely resembling the reference image.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Long Duan, Yong Li, Xiu-Shen Wei, Lin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-training plays a vital role in various vision tasks, such as object recognition and detection. Commonly used pre-training methods, which typically rely on randomized approaches like uniform or Gaussian distributions to initialize model parameters, often fall short when confronted with long-tailed distributions, especially in detection tasks. This is largely due to extreme data imbalance and the issue of simplicity bias. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-training framework for object detection, called Dynamic Rebalancing Contrastive Learning with Dual Reconstruction (2DRCL). Our method builds on a Holistic-Local Contrastive Learning mechanism, which aligns pre-training with object detection by capturing both global contextual semantics and detailed local patterns. To tackle the imbalance inherent in long-tailed data, we design a dynamic rebalancing strategy that adjusts the sampling of underrepresented instances throughout the pre-training process, ensuring better representation of tail classes. Moreover, Dual Reconstruction addresses simplicity bias by enforcing a reconstruction task aligned with the self-consistency principle, specifically benefiting underrepresented tail classes. Experiments on COCO and LVIS v1.0 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, particularly in improving the mAP/AP scores for tail classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Mohamad, Francesco Ponzio, Santa Di Cataldo, Damien Ambrosetti, Xavier Descombes</p>
<p>Abstract: Renal Cell Carcinoma is typically asymptomatic at the early stages for many patients. This leads to a late diagnosis of the tumor, where the curability likelihood is lower, and makes the mortality rate of Renal Cell Carcinoma high, with respect to its incidence rate. To increase the survival chance, a fast and correct categorization of the tumor subtype is paramount. Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool. We demonstrate the classification capability of our tool on a whole slide imaging dataset for Renal Cancer subtyping, and we compare our solution with several state-of-the-art classification counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Bellavia, Zhenjun Zhao, Luca Morelli, Fabio Remondino</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a modular, non-deep learning method for filtering and refining sparse correspondences in image matching. Assuming that motion flow within the scene can be approximated by local homography transformations, matches are aggregated into overlapping clusters corresponding to virtual planes using an iterative RANSAC-based approach, with non-conforming correspondences discarded. Moreover, the underlying planar structural design provides an explicit map between local patches associated with the matches, enabling optional refinement of keypoint positions through cross-correlation template matching after patch reprojection. Finally, to enhance robustness and fault-tolerance against violations of the piece-wise planar approximation assumption, a further strategy is designed for minimizing relative patch distortion in the plane reprojection by introducing an intermediate homography that projects both patches into a common plane. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on standard datasets and image matching pipelines, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Unlike other current comparisons, the proposed benchmark also takes into account the more general, real, and practical cases where camera intrinsics are unavailable. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed non-deep learning, geometry-based approach achieves performances that are either superior to or on par with recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Finally, this study suggests that there are still development potential in actual image matching solutions in the considered research direction, which could be in the future incorporated in novel deep image matching architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: The human gait is a complex interplay between the neuronal and the muscular systems, reflecting an individual's neurological and physiological condition. This makes gait analysis a valuable tool for biomechanics and medical experts. Traditional observational gait analysis is cost-effective but lacks reliability and accuracy, while instrumented gait analysis, particularly using marker-based optical systems, provides accurate data but is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a novel markerless approach for gait analysis using a multi-camera setup with smart edge sensors to estimate 3D body poses without fiducial markers. We propose a Siamese embedding network with triplet loss calculation to identify individuals by their gait pattern. This network effectively maps gait sequences to an embedding space that enables clustering sequences from the same individual or activity closely together while separating those of different ones. Our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for efficient automated gait analysis in diverse real-world environments, facilitating a wide range of applications.</p>

This study examines VP's benefits for black-box model-level backdoor detection. The visual prompt in VP maps class subspaces between source and target domains. We identify a misalignment, termed class subspace inconsistency, between clean and poisoned datasets. Based on this, we introduce \textsc{BProm}, a black-box model-level detection method to identify backdoors in suspicious models, if any. \textsc{BProm} leverages the low classification accuracy of prompted models when backdoors are present. Extensive experiments confirm \textsc{BProm}'s effectiveness.</p>

MFTIQ builds upon the flow-chaining concepts of MFT, integrating an Independent Quality (IQ) module that separates correspondence quality estimation from optical flow computations. This decoupling significantly enhances the accuracy and flexibility of the tracking process, allowing MFTIQ to maintain reliable trajectory predictions even in scenarios of prolonged occlusions and complex dynamics. Designed to be "plug-and-play", MFTIQ can be employed with any off-the-shelf optical flow method without the need for fine-tuning or architectural modifications. Experimental validations on the TAP-Vid Davis dataset show that MFTIQ with RoMa optical flow not only surpasses MFT but also performs comparably to state-of-the-art trackers while having substantially faster processing speed.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwen Wang, Zhonghao Wang, Oscar MacCormac, Jonathan Shapey, Tom Vercauteren</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements, segmentation based on deep neural networks in medical and surgical imaging faces several challenges, two of which we aim to address in this work. First, acquiring complete pixel-level segmentation labels for medical images is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. Second, typical segmentation pipelines cannot detect out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, leaving them prone to spurious outputs during deployment. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation approach exploiting OOD detection that learns only from sparsely annotated pixels from multiple positive-only classes. %but \emph{no background class} annotation. These multi-class positive annotations naturally fall within the in-distribution (ID) set. Unlabelled pixels may contain positive classes but also negative ones, including what is typically referred to as \emph{background} in standard segmentation formulations. Here, we forgo the need for background annotation and consider these together with any other unseen classes as part of the OOD set. Our framework can integrate, at a pixel-level, any OOD detection approaches designed for classification tasks. To address the lack of existing OOD datasets and established evaluation metric for medical image segmentation, we propose a cross-validation strategy that treats held-out labelled classes as OOD. Extensive experiments on both multi-class hyperspectral and RGB surgical imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalisation capability of our proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadaniela Egidi, Josephin Giacomini, Paolo Leonesi, Pierluigi Maponi, Federico Mearelli, Edin Trebovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion Magnification (MM) is a collection of relative recent techniques within the realm of Image Processing. The main motivation of introducing these techniques in to support the human visual system to capture relevant displacements of an object of interest; these motions can be in object color and in object location. In fact, the goal is to opportunely process a video sequence to obtain as output a new video in which motions are magnified and visible to the viewer. We propose a numerical technique using the Phase-Based Motion Magnification which analyses the video sequence in the Fourier Domain and rely on the Fourier Shifting Property. We describe the mathematical foundation of this method and the corresponding implementation in a numerical algorithm. We present preliminary experiments, focusing on some basic test made up using synthetic images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindya Sundar Das, Guansong Pang, Monowar Bhuyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual anomaly detection targets to detect images that notably differ from normal pattern, and it has found extensive application in identifying defective parts within the manufacturing industry. These anomaly detection paradigms predominantly focus on training detection models using only clean, unlabeled normal samples, assuming an absence of contamination; a condition often unmet in real-world scenarios. The performance of these methods significantly depends on the quality of the data and usually decreases when exposed to noise. We introduce a systematic adaptive method that employs deviation learning to compute anomaly scores end-to-end while addressing data contamination by assigning relative importance to the weights of individual instances. In this approach, the anomaly scores for normal instances are designed to approximate scalar scores obtained from the known prior distribution. Meanwhile, anomaly scores for anomaly examples are adjusted to exhibit statistically significant deviations from these reference scores. Our approach incorporates a constrained optimization problem within the deviation learning framework to update instance weights, resolving this problem for each mini-batch. Comprehensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed method surpasses competing techniques and exhibits both stability and robustness in the presence of data contamination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Lin, Shixuan Zhao, Xinxu Wei, Amir Shmuel, Yongjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D microscopic cerebrovascular images are characterized by their high resolution, presenting significant annotation challenges, large data volumes, and intricate variations in detail. Together, these factors make achieving high-quality, efficient whole-brain segmentation particularly demanding. In this paper, we propose a novel Vessel-Pattern-Based Semi-Supervised Distillation pipeline (VpbSD) to address the challenges of 3D microscopic cerebrovascular segmentation. This pipeline initially constructs a vessel-pattern codebook that captures diverse vascular structures from unlabeled data during the teacher model's pretraining phase. In the knowledge distillation stage, the codebook facilitates the transfer of rich knowledge from a heterogeneous teacher model to a student model, while the semi-supervised approach further enhances the student model's exposure to diverse learning samples. Experimental results on real-world data, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, demonstrate that our pipeline and its individual components effectively address the challenges inherent in microscopic cerebrovascular segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenjun Yu, Wenqiang Xu, Pengfei Xie, Yutong Li, Cewu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ViTaM-D, a novel visual-tactile framework for dynamic hand-object interaction reconstruction, integrating distributed tactile sensing for more accurate contact modeling. While existing methods focus primarily on visual inputs, they struggle with capturing detailed contact interactions such as object deformation. Our approach leverages distributed tactile sensors to address this limitation by introducing DF-Field. This distributed force-aware contact representation models both kinetic and potential energy in hand-object interaction. ViTaM-D first reconstructs hand-object interactions using a visual-only network, VDT-Net, and then refines contact details through a force-aware optimization (FO) process, enhancing object deformation modeling. To benchmark our approach, we introduce the HOT dataset, which features 600 sequences of hand-object interactions, including deformable objects, built in a high-precision simulation environment. Extensive experiments on both the DexYCB and HOT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods such as gSDF and HOTrack. Our results highlight the superior performance of ViTaM-D in both rigid and deformable object reconstruction, as well as the effectiveness of DF-Field in refining hand poses. This work offers a comprehensive solution to dynamic hand-object interaction reconstruction by seamlessly integrating visual and tactile data. Codes, models, and datasets will be available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, attention mechanisms have significantly enhanced the performance of object detection by focusing on key feature information. However, prevalent methods still encounter difficulties in effectively balancing local and global features. This imbalance hampers their ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader contextual information-two critical elements for achieving accurate object detection.To address these challenges, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed Local-Global Attention, which is designed to better integrate both local and global contextual features. Specifically, our approach combines multi-scale convolutions with positional encoding, enabling the model to focus on local details while concurrently considering the broader global context. Additionally, we introduce a learnable parameters, which allow the model to dynamically adjust the relative importance of local and global attention, depending on the specific requirements of the task, thereby optimizing feature representations across multiple scales.We have thoroughly evaluated the Local-Global Attention mechanism on several widely used object detection and classification datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the detection of objects at various scales, with particularly strong performance on multi-class and small object detection tasks. In comparison to existing attention mechanisms, Local-Global Attention consistently outperforms them across several key metrics, all while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Zhaowei Li, Qi Xu, Linfeng Li, YiQing Cai, Botian Jiang, Hang Song, Xingcan Hu, Pengyu Wang, Li Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in fine-grained visual understanding across a range of tasks. However, they often encounter significant challenges due to inadequate alignment for fine-grained knowledge, which restricts their ability to accurately capture local details and attain a comprehensive global perception. While recent advancements have focused on aligning object expressions with grounding information, they typically lack explicit integration of object images, which contain affluent information beyond mere texts or coordinates. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel fine-grained visual knowledge alignment method that effectively aligns and integrates multi-scale knowledge of objects, including texts, coordinates, and images. This innovative method is underpinned by our multi-scale fine-grained enhancement data synthesis pipeline, which provides over 300K essential training data to enhance alignment and improve overall performance. Furthermore, we present TinyGroundingGPT, a series of compact models optimized for high-level alignments. With a scale of approximately 3B parameters, TinyGroundingGPT achieves outstanding results in grounding tasks while delivering performance comparable to larger MLLMs in complex visual scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to automatically build 3D digital twins of plants from images has countless applications in agriculture, environmental science, robotics, and other fields. However, current 3D reconstruction methods fail to recover complete shapes of plants due to heavy occlusion and complex geometries. In this work, we present a novel method for 3D reconstruction of agricultural crops based on optimizing a parametric model of plant morphology via inverse procedural modeling. Our method first estimates depth maps by fitting a neural radiance field and then employs Bayesian optimization to estimate plant morphological parameters that result in consistent depth renderings. The resulting 3D model is complete and biologically plausible. We validate our method on a dataset of real images of agricultural fields, and demonstrate that the reconstructions can be used for a variety of monitoring and simulation applications.</p>

Our system features a streamlined yet functionally robust interface, allowing for the articulation of editing operations (e.g., inserting elements, erasing objects, altering color) with minimal input. These interactions are monitored by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to anticipate editing intentions in real time, bypassing the need for explicit prompt entry. Finally, we apply a powerful diffusion prior, enhanced by a carefully learned two-branch plug-in module, to process editing requests with precise control. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicQuill in achieving high-quality image edits. Please visit https://magic-quill.github.io to try out our system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abeer Badawi, Somayya Elmoghazy, Samira Choudhury, Sara Elgazzar, Khalid Elgazzar, Amer Burhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dementia is a neurodegenerative condition that combines several diseases and impacts millions around the world and those around them. Although cognitive impairment is profoundly disabling, it is the noncognitive features of dementia, referred to as Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS), that are most closely associated with a diminished quality of life. Agitation and aggression (AA) in people living with dementia (PwD) contribute to distress and increased healthcare demands. Current assessment methods rely on caregiver intervention and reporting of incidents, introducing subjectivity and bias. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive algorithms offer a potential solution for detecting AA episodes in PwD when utilized in real-time. We present a 5-year study system that integrates a multimodal approach, utilizing the EmbracePlus wristband and a video detection system to predict AA in severe dementia patients. We conducted a pilot study with three participants at the Ontario Shores Mental Health Institute to validate the functionality of the system. The system collects and processes raw and digital biomarkers from the EmbracePlus wristband to accurately predict AA. The system also detected pre-agitation patterns at least six minutes before the AA event, which was not previously discovered from the EmbracePlus wristband. Furthermore, the privacy-preserving video system uses a masking tool to hide the features of the people in frames and employs a deep learning model for AA detection. The video system also helps identify the actual start and end time of the agitation events for labeling. The promising results of the preliminary data analysis underscore the ability of the system to predict AA events. The ability of the proposed system to run autonomously in real-time and identify AA and pre-agitation symptoms without external assistance represents a significant milestone in this research field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inaccuracies in polygraph tests often lead to wrongful convictions, false information, and bias, all of which have significant consequences for both legal and political systems. Recently, analyzing facial micro-expressions has emerged as a method for detecting deception; however, current models have not reached high accuracy and generalizability. The purpose of this study is to aid in remedying these problems. The unique multimodal transformer architecture used in this study improves upon previous approaches by using auditory inputs, visual facial micro-expressions, and manually transcribed gesture annotations, moving closer to a reliable non-invasive lie detection model. Visual and auditory features were extracted using the Vision Transformer and OpenSmile models respectively, which were then concatenated with the transcriptions of participants micro-expressions and gestures. Various models were trained for the classification of lies and truths using these processed and concatenated features. The CNN Conv1D multimodal model achieved an average accuracy of 95.4%. However, further research is still required to create higher-quality datasets and even more generalized models for more diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Injune Hwang, Karthik Saravanan, Caterina V Coralli, S Jack Tu, Sthephen J Mellon</p>
<p>Abstract: Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often experience non-specific anterior knee pain, arising from abnormal patellofemoral joint (PFJ) instability. Tracking PFJ motion is challenging since static imaging modalities like CT and MRI are limited by field of view and metal artefact interference. Ultrasounds offer an alternative modality for dynamic musculoskeletal imaging. We aim to achieve accurate visualisation of patellar tracking and PFJ motion, using 3D registration of point clouds extracted from ultrasound scans across different angles of joint flexion. Ultrasound images containing soft tissue are often mislabeled as bone during segmentation, resulting in noisy 3D point clouds that hinder accurate registration of the bony joint anatomy. Machine learning the intrinsic geometry of the knee bone may help us eliminate these false positives. As the intrinsic geometry of the knee does not change during PFJ motion, one may expect this to be robust across multiple angles of joint flexion. Our dynamical graphs-based post-processing algorithm (DG-PPU) is able to achieve this, creating smoother point clouds that accurately represent bony knee anatomy across different angles. After inverting these point clouds back to their original ultrasound images, we evaluated that DG-PPU outperformed manual data cleaning done by our lab technician, deleting false positives and noise with 98.2% precision across three different angles of joint flexion. DG-PPU is the first algorithm to automate the post-processing of 3D point clouds extracted from ultrasound scans. With DG-PPU, we contribute towards the development of a novel patellar mal-tracking assessment system with ultrasound, which currently does not exist.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is a cornerstone of digital pathology, offering detailed insights critical for diagnosis and research. Yet, the gigapixel size of WSIs imposes significant computational challenges, limiting their practical utility. Our novel approach addresses these challenges by leveraging various encoders for intelligent data reduction and employing a different classification model to ensure robust, permutation-invariant representations of WSIs. A key innovation of our method is the ability to distill the complex information of an entire WSI into a single vector, effectively capturing the essential features needed for accurate analysis. This approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of WSI analysis, enabling more accurate pathological assessments without the need for extensive computational resources. This breakthrough equips us with the capability to effectively address the challenges posed by large image resolutions in whole-slide imaging, paving the way for more scalable and effective utilization of WSIs in medical diagnostics and research, marking a significant advancement in the field.</p>

Here, we present an MIL strategy, the Fluoroformer module, that is specifically tailored to multiplexed WSIs by leveraging scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) to interpretably fuse information across disparate channels. On a cohort of 434 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples, we show that the Fluoroformer both obtains strong prognostic performance and recapitulates immuno-oncological hallmarks of NSCLC. Our technique thereby provides a path for adapting state-of-the-art AI techniques to emerging spatial biology assays.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new annotated microscopic cellular image dataset to improve the effectiveness of machine learning methods for cellular image analysis. Cell counting is an important step in cell analysis. Typically, domain experts manually count cells in a microscopic image. Automated cell counting can potentially eliminate this tedious, time-consuming process. However, a good, labeled dataset is required for training an accurate machine learning model. Our dataset includes microscopic images of cells, and for each image, the cell count and the location of individual cells. The data were collected as part of an ongoing study investigating the potential of electrical stimulation to modulate stem cell differentiation and possible applications for neural repair. Compared to existing publicly available datasets, our dataset has more images of cells stained with more variety of antibodies (protein components of immune responses against invaders) typically used for cell analysis. The experimental results on this dataset indicate that none of the five existing models under this study are able to achieve sufficiently accurate count to replace the manual methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ross Cutler, Babak Naderi, Vishak Gopal, Dharmendar Palle</p>
<p>Abstract: Photorealistic avatars are human avatars that look, move, and talk like real people. The performance of photorealistic avatars has significantly improved recently based on objective metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD. However, recent photorealistic avatar publications do not provide subjective tests of the avatars to measure human usability factors. We provide an open source test framework to subjectively measure photorealistic avatar performance in ten dimensions: realism, trust, comfortableness using, comfortableness interacting with, appropriateness for work, creepiness, formality, affinity, resemblance to the person, and emotion accuracy. We show that the correlation of nine of these subjective metrics with PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD is weak, and moderate for emotion accuracy. The crowdsourced subjective test framework is highly reproducible and accurate when compared to a panel of experts. We analyze a wide range of avatars from photorealistic to cartoon-like and show that some photorealistic avatars are approaching real video performance based on these dimensions. We also find that for avatars above a certain level of realism, eight of these measured dimensions are strongly correlated. In particular, for photorealistic avatars there is a linear relationship between avatar affinity and realism; in other words, there is no uncanny valley effect for photorealistic avatars in the telecommunication scenario. We provide several extensions of this test framework for future work and discuss design implications for telecommunication systems. The test framework is available at https://github.com/microsoft/P.910.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charles Roques-Carmes, Kai Wang, Yuanmu Yang, Arka Majumdar, Zin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Metasurfaces -- ultrathin structures composed of subwavelength optical elements -- have revolutionized light manipulation by enabling precise control over electromagnetic waves' amplitude, phase, polarization, and spectral properties. Concurrently, computational imaging leverages algorithms to reconstruct images from optically processed signals, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging systems. This review explores the synergistic integration of metaoptics and computational imaging, "computational metaoptics," which combines the physical wavefront shaping ability of metasurfaces with advanced computational algorithms to enhance imaging performance beyond conventional limits. We discuss how computational metaoptics addresses the inherent limitations of single-layer metasurfaces in achieving multifunctionality without compromising efficiency. By treating metasurfaces as physical preconditioners and co-designing them with reconstruction algorithms through end-to-end (inverse) design, it is possible to jointly optimize the optical hardware and computational software. This holistic approach allows for the automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs and reconstruction methods that significantly improve imaging capabilities. Advanced applications enabled by computational metaoptics are highlighted, including phase imaging and quantum state measurement, which benefit from the metasurfaces' ability to manipulate complex light fields and the computational algorithms' capacity to reconstruct high-dimensional information. We also examine performance evaluation challenges, emphasizing the need for new metrics that account for the combined optical and computational nature of these systems. Finally, we identify new frontiers in computational metaoptics which point toward a future where computational metaoptics may play a central role in advancing imaging science and technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Wang, Dingwei Tan, Yen-Ling Kuo, Zhaowei Sun, Jeremy M. Wolfe, Tat-Jen Cham, Mengmi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Imagine searching a collection of coins for quarters ($0.25$), dimes ($0.10$), nickels ($0.05$), and pennies ($0.01$)-a hybrid foraging task where observers look for multiple instances of multiple target types. In such tasks, how do target values and their prevalence influence foraging and eye movement behaviors (e.g., should you prioritize rare quarters or common nickels)? To explore this, we conducted human psychophysics experiments, revealing that humans are proficient reward foragers. Their eye fixations are drawn to regions with higher average rewards, fixation durations are longer on more valuable targets, and their cumulative rewards exceed chance, approaching the upper bound of optimal foragers. To probe these decision-making processes of humans, we developed a transformer-based Visual Forager (VF) model trained via reinforcement learning. Our VF model takes a series of targets, their corresponding values, and the search image as inputs, processes the images using foveated vision, and produces a sequence of eye movements along with decisions on whether to collect each fixated item. Our model outperforms all baselines, achieves cumulative rewards comparable to those of humans, and approximates human foraging behavior in eye movements and foraging biases within time-limited environments. Furthermore, stress tests on out-of-distribution tasks with novel targets, unseen values, and varying set sizes demonstrate the VF model's effective generalization. Our work offers valuable insights into the relationship between eye movements and decision-making, with our model serving as a powerful tool for further exploration of this connection. All data, code, and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilin Ruan, Wenzhuo Wang, Siru Zhong, Wei Chen, Li Liu, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting spatio-temporal traffic flow presents significant challenges due to complex interactions between spatial and temporal factors. Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization.

In this paper, we investigate this technique from three novel perspectives to provide deeper insights into how and why weight-averaged model-merging works: (1) we examine the intrinsic patterns captured by the learning of the model weights, through the visualizations of their patterns on several datasets, showing that these weights often encode structured and interpretable patterns; (2) we investigate model ensemble merging strategies based on averaging on weights versus averaging on features, providing detailed analyses across diverse architectures and datasets; and (3) we explore the impact on model-merging prediction stability in terms of changing the parameter magnitude, revealing insights into the way of weight averaging works as regularization by showing the robustness across different parameter scales. Our findings shed light on the "black box" of weight-averaged model-merging, offering valuable insights and practical recommendations that advance the model-merging process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harini G., Aiman Farooq, Deepak Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Thoracic trauma often results in rib fractures, which demand swift and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. However, detecting these fractures on rib CT scans poses considerable challenges, involving the analysis of many image slices in sequence. Despite notable advancements in algorithms for automated fracture segmentation, the persisting challenges stem from the diverse shapes and sizes of these fractures. To address these issues, this study introduces a sophisticated deep-learning model with an auxiliary classification task designed to enhance the accuracy of rib fracture segmentation. The auxiliary classification task is crucial in distinguishing between fractured ribs and negative regions, encompassing non-fractured ribs and surrounding tissues, from the patches obtained from CT scans. By leveraging this auxiliary task, the model aims to improve feature representation at the bottleneck layer by highlighting the regions of interest. Experimental results on the RibFrac dataset demonstrate significant improvement in segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junqi Liu, Yun Zhang, Xiaoqi Wang, Xu Long, Sam Kwong</p>
<p>Abstract: Just Recognizable Difference (JRD) represents the minimum visual difference that is detectable by machine vision, which can be exploited to promote machine vision oriented visual signal processing. In this paper, we propose a Deep Transformer based JRD (DT-JRD) prediction model for Video Coding for Machines (VCM), where the accurately predicted JRD can be used reduce the coding bit rate while maintaining the accuracy of machine tasks. Firstly, we model the JRD prediction as a multi-class classification and propose a DT-JRD prediction model that integrates an improved embedding, a content and distortion feature extraction, a multi-class classification and a novel learning strategy. Secondly, inspired by the perception property that machine vision exhibits a similar response to distortions near JRD, we propose an asymptotic JRD loss by using Gaussian Distribution-based Soft Labels (GDSL), which significantly extends the number of training labels and relaxes classification boundaries. Finally, we propose a DT-JRD based VCM to reduce the coding bits while maintaining the accuracy of object detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the mean absolute error of the predicted JRD by the DT-JRD is 5.574, outperforming the state-of-the-art JRD prediction model by 13.1%. Coding experiments shows that comparing with the VVC, the DT-JRD based VCM achieves an average of 29.58% bit rate reduction while maintaining the object detection accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Tomar, Alexander Binder, Andreas Kleppe</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalisation in computational histopathology is challenging because the images are substantially affected by differences among hospitals due to factors like fixation and staining of tissue and imaging equipment. We hypothesise that focusing on nuclei can improve the out-of-domain (OOD) generalisation in cancer detection. We propose a simple approach to improve OOD generalisation for cancer detection by focusing on nuclear morphology and organisation, as these are domain-invariant features critical in cancer detection. Our approach integrates original images with nuclear segmentation masks during training, encouraging the model to prioritise nuclei and their spatial arrangement. Going beyond mere data augmentation, we introduce a regularisation technique that aligns the representations of masks and original images. We show, using multiple datasets, that our method improves OOD generalisation and also leads to increased robustness to image corruptions and adversarial attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toufiq Musah, Prince Ebenezer Adjei, Kojo Obed Otoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and is increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Timely interventions can significantly influence stroke survivability and the quality of life after treatment. However, the standard and most widely available imaging method for confirming strokes and their sub-types, the NCCT, is more challenging and time-consuming to employ in cases of ischemic stroke. For this reason, we developed an automated method for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in NCCTs using the nnU-Net frame work, aimed at enhancing early treatment and improving the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients. We achieved Dice scores of 0.596 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.501 on the sampled dataset. After adjusting for outliers, these scores improved to 0.752 for the Dice score and 0.643 for the IoU. Proper delineation of the region of infarction can help clinicians better assess the potential impact of the infarction, and guide treatment procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikai Zhou, Shitong Shao, Lichen Bai, Zhiqiang Xu, Bo Han, Zeke Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have surfaced as a revolutionary element within the domain of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging, providing an advanced resolution to the enduring issue of reconciling radiation exposure with image quality. This comprehensive review synthesizes the rapid advancements in GAN-based LDCT denoising techniques, examining the evolution from foundational architectures to state-of-the-art models incorporating advanced features such as anatomical priors, perceptual loss functions, and innovative regularization strategies. We critically analyze various GAN architectures, including conditional GANs (cGANs), CycleGANs, and Super-Resolution GANs (SRGANs), elucidating their unique strengths and limitations in the context of LDCT denoising. The evaluation provides both qualitative and quantitative results related to the improvements in performance in benchmark and clinical datasets with metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. After highlighting the positive results, we discuss some of the challenges preventing a wider clinical use, including the interpretability of the images generated by GANs, synthetic artifacts, and the need for clinically relevant metrics. The review concludes by highlighting the essential significance of GAN-based methodologies in the progression of precision medicine via tailored LDCT denoising models, underlining the transformative possibilities presented by artificial intelligence within contemporary radiological practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: The human brain receives nutrients and oxygen through an intricate network of blood vessels. Pathology affecting small vessels, at the mesoscopic scale, represents a critical vulnerability within the cerebral blood supply and can lead to severe conditions, such as Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases. The advent of 7 Tesla MRI systems has enabled the acquisition of higher spatial resolution images, making it possible to visualise such vessels in the brain. However, the lack of publicly available annotated datasets has impeded the development of robust, machine learning-driven segmentation algorithms. To address this, the SMILE-UHURA challenge was organised. This challenge, held in conjunction with the ISBI 2023, in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, aimed to provide a platform for researchers working on related topics. The SMILE-UHURA challenge addresses the gap in publicly available annotated datasets by providing an annotated dataset of Time-of-Flight angiography acquired with 7T MRI. This dataset was created through a combination of automated pre-segmentation and extensive manual refinement. In this manuscript, sixteen submitted methods and two baseline methods are compared both quantitatively and qualitatively on two different datasets: held-out test MRAs from the same dataset as the training data (with labels kept secret) and a separate 7T ToF MRA dataset where both input volumes and labels are kept secret. The results demonstrate that most of the submitted deep learning methods, trained on the provided training dataset, achieved reliable segmentation performance. Dice scores reached up to 0.838 $\pm$ 0.066 and 0.716 $\pm$ 0.125 on the respective datasets, with an average performance of up to 0.804 $\pm$ 0.15.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyi Wang, Jonathan Lorraine, Yikai Wang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Sanja Fidler, Xiaohui Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pretrained on text to generate 3D meshes within a unified model. This offers key advantages of (1) leveraging spatial knowledge already embedded in LLMs, derived from textual sources like 3D tutorials, and (2) enabling conversational 3D generation and mesh understanding. A primary challenge is effectively tokenizing 3D mesh data into discrete tokens that LLMs can process seamlessly. To address this, we introduce LLaMA-Mesh, a novel approach that represents the vertex coordinates and face definitions of 3D meshes as plain text, allowing direct integration with LLMs without expanding the vocabulary. We construct a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset enabling pretrained LLMs to (1) generate 3D meshes from text prompts, (2) produce interleaved text and 3D mesh outputs as required, and (3) understand and interpret 3D meshes. Our work is the first to demonstrate that LLMs can be fine-tuned to acquire complex spatial knowledge for 3D mesh generation in a text-based format, effectively unifying the 3D and text modalities. LLaMA-Mesh achieves mesh generation quality on par with models trained from scratch while maintaining strong text generation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bipasha Kundu, Bidur Khanal, Richard Simon, Cristian A. Linte</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate left atrium (LA) segmentation from pre-operative scans is crucial for diagnosing atrial fibrillation, treatment planning, and supporting surgical interventions. While deep learning models are key in medical image segmentation, they often require extensive manually annotated data. Foundation models trained on larger datasets have reduced this dependency, enhancing generalizability and robustness through transfer learning. We explore DINOv2, a self-supervised learning vision transformer trained on natural images, for LA segmentation using MRI. The challenges for LA's complex anatomy, thin boundaries, and limited annotated data make accurate segmentation difficult before & during the image-guided intervention. We demonstrate DINOv2's ability to provide accurate & consistent segmentation, achieving a mean Dice score of .871 & a Jaccard Index of .792 for end-to-end fine-tuning. Through few-shot learning across various data sizes & patient counts, DINOv2 consistently outperforms baseline models. These results suggest that DINOv2 effectively adapts to MRI with limited data, highlighting its potential as a competitive tool for segmentation & encouraging broader use in medical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of vision-based manipulation for autonomous cutting and unpacking of transparent plastic bags in industrial setups, aligning with the Industry 4.0 paradigm. Industry 4.0, driven by data, connectivity, analytics, and robotics, promises enhanced accessibility and sustainability throughout the value chain. The integration of autonomous systems, including collaborative robots (cobots), into industrial processes is pivotal for efficiency and safety. The proposed solution employs advanced Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify transparent plastic bags under varying lighting and background conditions. Tracking algorithms and depth sensing technologies are utilized for 3D spatial awareness during pick and placement. The system addresses challenges in grasping and manipulation, considering optimal points, compliance control with vacuum gripping technology, and real-time automation for safe interaction in dynamic environments. The system's successful testing and validation in the lab with the FRANKA robot arm, showcases its potential for widespread industrial applications, while demonstrating effectiveness in automating the unpacking and cutting of transparent plastic bags for an 8-stack bulk-loader based on specific requirements and rigorous testing.</p>

By leveraging a reference action trajectory, MAGIC effectively identifies similar contact points and sequences of actions on novel objects to replicate a demonstrated strategy, such as using different hooks to retrieve distant objects of different shapes and sizes. Our method is based on a two-stage contact-point matching process that combines global shape matching using pretrained neural features with local curvature analysis to ensure precise and physically plausible contact points. We experiment with three tasks including scooping, hanging, and hooking objects. MAGIC demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, achieving significant improvements in runtime speed and generalization to different object categories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander C. Li, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Deepak Pathak, Xinlei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) improves downstream performance by learning useful representations. Is this actually true? We investigate this question and find that the features and representations learned during pre-training are not essential. Surprisingly, using only the attention patterns from pre-training (i.e., guiding how information flows between tokens) is sufficient for models to learn high quality features from scratch and achieve comparable downstream performance. We show this by introducing a simple method called attention transfer, where only the attention patterns from a pre-trained teacher ViT are transferred to a student, either by copying or distilling the attention maps. Since attention transfer lets the student learn its own features, ensembling it with a fine-tuned teacher also further improves accuracy on ImageNet. We systematically study various aspects of our findings on the sufficiency of attention maps, including distribution shift settings where they underperform fine-tuning. We hope our exploration provides a better understanding of what pre-training accomplishes and leads to a useful alternative to the standard practice of fine-tuning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Hermann Paul Fuchs, Akshara Preethy Byju, Alisa Walda, Behnood Rasti, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of deep learning-based models for the compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing due to the sharp growing of hyperspectral data archives. Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Zhang, Mingliang Xu, Yonghong Tian, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a Spatial Re-parameterization (SpRe) method for the N:M sparsity in CNNs. SpRe is stemmed from an observation regarding the restricted variety in spatial sparsity present in N:M sparsity compared with unstructured sparsity. Particularly, N:M sparsity exhibits a fixed sparsity rate within the spatial domains due to its distinctive pattern that mandates N non-zero components among M successive weights in the input channel dimension of convolution filters. On the contrary, we observe that unstructured sparsity displays a substantial divergence in sparsity across the spatial domains, which we experimentally verified to be very crucial for its robust performance retention compared with N:M sparsity. Therefore, SpRe employs the spatial-sparsity distribution of unstructured sparsity to assign an extra branch in conjunction with the original N:M branch at training time, which allows the N:M sparse network to sustain a similar distribution of spatial sparsity with unstructured sparsity. During inference, the extra branch can be further re-parameterized into the main N:M branch, without exerting any distortion on the sparse pattern or additional computation costs. SpRe has achieved a commendable feat by matching the performance of N:M sparsity methods with state-of-the-art unstructured sparsity methods across various benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving with heightened safety and efficiency depends on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) cooperative perception (CP), which allows vehicles to share perception data, thereby enhancing situational awareness and overcoming the limitations of the sensing ability of individual vehicles. V2X CP is crucial for extending perception range, improving accuracy, and strengthening the decision-making and control capabilities of autonomous vehicles in complex environments. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances in V2X CP, introducing mathematical models of CP processes across various collaboration strategies. We examine essential techniques for reliable perception sharing, including agent selection, data alignment, and fusion methods. Key issues are analyzed, such as agent and model heterogeneity, perception uncertainty, and the impact of V2X communication constraints like delays and data loss on CP effectiveness. To inspire further advancements in V2X CP, we outline promising avenues, including privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI), collaborative AI, and integrated sensing frameworks, as pathways to enhance CP capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunshan Zhong, Jiawei Hu, Mengzhao Chen, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs (training & inference) undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT' superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the performance of 3-bit ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Layton Aho, Mark Winter, Marc DeCarlo, Agne Frismantiene, Yannick Blum, Paolo Armando Gagliardi, Olivier Pertz, Andrew R. Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Live cell microscopy captures 5-D $(x,y,z,channel,time)$ movies that display patterns of cellular motion and signaling dynamics. We present here a metric kernel function for spatiotemporal patterns of cell signaling dynamics in 5-D live cell microscopy movies unique in requiring no a priori knowledge of expected pattern dynamics, and no training data. The approach uses Kolmogorov complexity theory to compute a metric distance between movies and to measure the meaningful information among subsets of movies. Cell signaling kymographs store at each spatiotemporal cell centroid the cell signaling state, or a functional output such as velocity. Patterns of similarity are identified via the metric normalized compression distance (NCD). The NCD is a reproducing kernel for a Hilbert space that represents the input cell signaling kymographs as points in a low dimensional embedding that optimally captures the pattern similarity identified by the NCD throughout the space. The only parameter is the expected cell radii ($\mu m$). A new formulation of the cluster structure function optimally estimates the meaningful information captured by the embedding. Also presented is the cell signaling structure function (SSF), a Kolmogorov structure function that optimally measures cell signaling state as nuclear intensity w.r.t. surrounding cytoplasm, a significant improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art cytonuclear ratio.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation & memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation & memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Roca, Gr\'egory Kuchcinski, Jean-Pierre Pruvo, Dorian Manouvriez, Renaud Lopes</p>
<p>Abstract: In MRI studies, the aggregation of imaging data from multiple acquisition sites enhances sample size but may introduce site-related variabilities that hinder consistency in subsequent analyses. Deep learning methods for image translation have emerged as a solution for harmonizing MR images across sites. In this study, we introduce IGUANe (Image Generation with Unified Adversarial Networks), an original 3D model that leverages the strengths of domain translation and straightforward application of style transfer methods for multicenter brain MR image harmonization. IGUANe extends CycleGAN by integrating an arbitrary number of domains for training through a many-to-one architecture. The framework based on domain pairs enables the implementation of sampling strategies that prevent confusion between site-related and biological variabilities. During inference, the model can be applied to any image, even from an unknown acquisition site, making it a universal generator for harmonization. Trained on a dataset comprising T1-weighted images from 11 different scanners, IGUANe was evaluated on data from unseen sites. The assessments included the transformation of MR images with traveling subjects, the preservation of pairwise distances between MR images within domains, the evolution of volumetric patterns related to age and Alzheimer$'$s disease (AD), and the performance in age regression and patient classification tasks. Comparisons with other harmonization and normalization methods suggest that IGUANe better preserves individual information in MR images and is more suitable for maintaining and reinforcing variabilities related to age and AD. Future studies may further assess IGUANe in other multicenter contexts, either using the same model or retraining it for applications to different image modalities. IGUANe is available at https://github.com/RocaVincent/iguane_harmonization.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyang Lu, Qinghan Chen, Ming Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow prediction is a crucial underlying task in understanding dynamic scenes as it offers fundamental motion information. However, contemporary scene flow methods encounter three major challenges. Firstly, flow estimation solely based on local receptive fields lacks long-dependency matching of point pairs. To address this issue, we propose global attentive flow embedding to match all-to-all point pairs in both feature space and Euclidean space, providing global initialization before local refinement. Secondly, there are deformations existing in non-rigid objects after warping, which leads to variations in the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow, a spatial temporal feature re-embedding module is devised to acquire the sequence features after deformation. Furthermore, previous methods perform poor generalization due to the significant domain gap between the synthesized and LiDAR-scanned datasets. We leverage novel domain adaptive losses to effectively bridge the gap of motion inference from synthetic to real-world. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, with particularly outstanding results on real-world LiDAR-scanned datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuehao Song, Xinggang Wang, Jingfeng Yao, Wenyu Liu, Jinglin Zhang, Xiangmin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze following aims to interpret human-scene interactions by predicting the person's focal point of gaze. Prevailing approaches often adopt a two-stage framework, whereby multi-modality information is extracted in the initial stage for gaze target prediction. Consequently, the efficacy of these methods highly depends on the precision of the preceding modality extraction. Others use a single-modality approach with complex decoders, increasing network computational load. Inspired by the remarkable success of pre-trained plain vision transformers (ViTs), we introduce a novel single-modality gaze following framework called ViTGaze. In contrast to previous methods, it creates a novel gaze following framework based mainly on powerful encoders (relative decoder parameters less than 1%). Our principal insight is that the inter-token interactions within self-attention can be transferred to interactions between humans and scenes. Leveraging this presumption, we formulate a framework consisting of a 4D interaction encoder and a 2D spatial guidance module to extract human-scene interaction information from self-attention maps. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that ViT with self-supervised pre-training has an enhanced ability to extract correlation information. Many experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among all single-modality methods (3.4% improvement in the area under curve (AUC) score, 5.1% improvement in the average precision (AP)) and very comparable performance against multi-modality methods with 59% number of parameters less.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Ahmad, Salvatore Distifano, Adil Mehmood Khan, Manuel Mazzara, Chenyu Li, Hao Li, Jagannath Aryal, Yao Ding, Gemine Vivone, Danfeng Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSC) presents significant challenges owing to the high dimensionality and intricate nature of Hyperspectral (HS) data. While traditional Machine Learning (TML) approaches have demonstrated effectiveness, they often encounter substantial obstacles in real-world applications, including the variability of optimal feature sets, subjectivity in human-driven design, inherent biases, and methodological limitations. Specifically, TML suffers from the curse of dimensionality, difficulties in feature selection and extraction, insufficient consideration of spatial information, limited robustness against noise, scalability issues, and inadequate adaptability to complex data distributions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as robust solutions to address these challenges. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of current trends and future prospects in HSC, emphasizing advancements from DL models to the increasing adoption of Transformer and Mamba Model architectures. We systematically review key concepts, methodologies, and state-of-the-art approaches in DL for HSC. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of Transformer-based models and the Mamba Model in HSC, detailing their advantages and challenges. Emerging trends in HSC are explored, including in-depth discussions on Explainable AI and Interoperability concepts, alongside Diffusion Models for image denoising, feature extraction, and image fusion. Comprehensive experimental results were conducted on three HS datasets to substantiate the efficacy of various conventional DL models and Transformers. Additionally, we identify several open challenges and pertinent research questions in the field of HSC. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential applications aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of HSC.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI-generated video has revolutionized short video production, filmmaking, and personalized media, making video local editing an essential tool. However, this progress also blurs the line between reality and fiction, posing challenges in multimedia forensics. To solve this urgent issue, V2A-Mark is proposed to address the limitations of current video tampering forensics, such as poor generalizability, singular function, and single modality focus. Combining the fragility of video-into-video steganography with deep robust watermarking, our method can embed invisible visual-audio localization watermarks and copyright watermarks into the original video frames and audio, enabling precise manipulation localization and copyright protection. We also design a temporal alignment and fusion module and degradation prompt learning to enhance the localization accuracy and decoding robustness. Meanwhile, we introduce a sample-level audio localization method and a cross-modal copyright extraction mechanism to couple the information of audio and video frames. The effectiveness of V2A-Mark has been verified on a visual-audio tampering dataset, emphasizing its superiority in localization precision and copyright accuracy, crucial for the sustainable development of video editing in the AIGC video era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Ueda, Xujun Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of fertilizer-induced stress in tomato plants is crucial for optimizing crop yield through timely management interventions. While conventional optical methods struggle to detect fertilizer stress in young leaves, these leaves contain valuable diagnostic information through their microscopic hair-like structures, particularly trichomes, which existing approaches have overlooked. This study introduces a smartphone-based noninvasive technique that leverages mobile computing and digital imaging capabilities to quantify trichome density on young leaves with superior detection latency. Our method uniquely combines augmented reality technology with image processing algorithms to analyze trichomes transferred onto specialized measurement paper. A robust automated pipeline processes these images through region extraction, perspective transformation, and illumination correction to precisely quantify trichome density. Validation experiments on hydroponically grown tomatoes under varying fertilizer conditions demonstrated the method's effectiveness. Leave-one-out cross-validation revealed strong predictive performance with the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC: 0.82) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC: 0.64), while the predicted and observed trichome densities exhibited high correlation ($r = 0.79$). This innovative approach transforms smartphones into precise diagnostic tools for plant nutrition assessment, offering a practical, cost-effective solution for precision agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Guo, Shuai Lu, Weihang Zhang, Fang Chen, Hongen Liao, Huiqi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies highlighted a practical setting of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that builds a unified model for multi-class images. Despite various advancements addressing this challenging task, the detection performance under the multi-class setting still lags far behind state-of-the-art class-separated models. Our research aims to bridge this substantial performance gap. In this paper, we introduce a minimalistic reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework, namely Dinomaly, which leverages pure Transformer architectures without relying on complex designs, additional modules, or specialized tricks. Given this powerful framework consisted of only Attentions and MLPs, we found four simple components that are essential to multi-class anomaly detection: (1) Foundation Transformers that extracts universal and discriminative features, (2) Noisy Bottleneck where pre-existing Dropouts do all the noise injection tricks, (3) Linear Attention that naturally cannot focus, and (4) Loose Reconstruction that does not force layer-to-layer and point-by-point reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted across popular anomaly detection benchmarks including MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD. Our proposed Dinomaly achieves impressive image-level AUROC of 99.6%, 98.7%, and 89.3% on the three datasets respectively, which is not only superior to state-of-the-art multi-class UAD methods, but also achieves the most advanced class-separated UAD records.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadjavad Matinkia, Nilanjan Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffeomorphic image registration (DIR) is a critical task in 3D medical image analysis, aimed at finding topology preserving deformations between pairs of images. Focusing on the solution of the flow map differential equation as the diffeomorphic deformation, recent methods use discrete timesteps along with various regularization terms to penalize the negative determinant of Jacobian and impose smoothness of the solution vector field. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach for diffeomorphic 3D-image registration which finds the diffeomorphisms in the time continuum with only a single regularization term and no additional integration. As one of the fundamental properties of flow maps, we exploit the semigroup property as the only form of regularization, ensuring temporally continuous diffeomorphic flows between pairs of images. Leveraging this property, our method alleviates the need for additional regularization terms and scaling and squaring integration during both training and evaluation. To achieve time-continuous diffeomorphisms, we employ time-embedded UNets, an architecture commonly utilized in diffusion models. The proposed method reveals that ensuring diffeomorphism in a continuous time interval leads to better registration results. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over both learning-based and optimization-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gu\'enol\'e Fiche, Simon Leglaive, Xavier Alameda-Pineda, Francesc Moreno-Noguer</p>
<p>Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is a highly ambiguous problem, as an infinite set of 3D interpretations can explain the 2D observation equally well. Nevertheless, most HMR methods overlook this issue and make a single prediction without accounting for this ambiguity. A few approaches generate a distribution of human meshes, enabling the sampling of multiple predictions; however, none of them is competitive with the latest single-output model when making a single prediction. This work proposes a new approach based on masked generative modeling. By tokenizing the human pose and shape, we formulate the HMR task as generating a sequence of discrete tokens conditioned on an input image. We introduce MEGA, a MaskEd Generative Autoencoder trained to recover human meshes from images and partial human mesh token sequences. Given an image, our flexible generation scheme allows us to predict a single human mesh in deterministic mode or to generate multiple human meshes in stochastic mode. Experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks show that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art performance in deterministic and stochastic modes, outperforming single-output and multi-output approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Animation techniques bring digital 3D worlds and characters to life. However, manual animation is tedious and automated techniques are often specialized to narrow shape classes. In our work, we propose a technique for automatic re-animation of various 3D shapes based on a motion prior extracted from a video diffusion model. Unlike existing 4D generation methods, we focus solely on the motion, and we leverage an explicit mesh-based representation compatible with existing computer-graphics pipelines. Furthermore, our utilization of diffusion features enhances accuracy of our motion fitting. We analyze efficacy of these features for animation fitting and we experimentally validate our approach for two different diffusion models and four animation models. Finally, we demonstrate that our time-efficient zero-shot method achieves a superior performance re-animating a diverse set of 3D shapes when compared to existing techniques in a user study.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Xie, Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael A. Lepori, Alexa R. Tartaglini, Wai Keen Vong, Thomas Serre, Brenden M. Lake, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: Though vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings, they exhibit surprising failures when performing tasks involving visual relations. This begs the question: how do ViTs attempt to perform tasks that require computing visual relations between objects? Prior efforts to interpret ViTs tend to focus on characterizing relevant low-level visual features. In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic interpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to perform abstract visual reasoning. We present a case study of a fundamental, yet surprisingly difficult, relational reasoning task: judging whether two visual entities are the same or different. We find that pretrained ViTs fine-tuned on this task often exhibit two qualitatively different stages of processing despite having no obvious inductive biases to do so: 1) a perceptual stage wherein local object features are extracted and stored in a disentangled representation, and 2) a relational stage wherein object representations are compared. In the second stage, we find evidence that ViTs can learn to represent somewhat abstract visual relations, a capability that has long been considered out of reach for artificial neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that failures at either stage can prevent a model from learning a generalizable solution to our fairly simple tasks. By understanding ViTs in terms of discrete processing stages, one can more precisely diagnose and rectify shortcomings of existing and future models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Liu, Zhihang Fu, Chao Chen, Sheng Jin, Ze Chen, Mingyuan Tao, Rongxin Jiang, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The key to OOD detection has two aspects: generalized feature representation and precise category description. Recently, vision-language models such as CLIP provide significant advances in both two issues, but constructing precise category descriptions is still in its infancy due to the absence of unseen categories. This work introduces two hierarchical contexts, namely perceptual context and spurious context, to carefully describe the precise category boundary through automatic prompt tuning. Specifically, perceptual contexts perceive the inter-category difference (e.g., cats vs apples) for current classification tasks, while spurious contexts further identify spurious (similar but exactly not) OOD samples for every single category (e.g., cats vs panthers, apples vs peaches). The two contexts hierarchically construct the precise description for a certain category, which is, first roughly classifying a sample to the predicted category and then delicately identifying whether it is truly an ID sample or actually OOD. Moreover, the precise descriptions for those categories within the vision-language framework present a novel application: CATegory-EXtensible OOD detection (CATEX). One can efficiently extend the set of recognizable categories by simply merging the hierarchical contexts learned under different sub-task settings. And extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate CATEX's effectiveness, robustness, and category-extensibility. For instance, CATEX consistently surpasses the rivals by a large margin with several protocols on the challenging ImageNet-1K dataset. In addition, we offer new insights on how to efficiently scale up the prompt engineering in vision-language models to recognize thousands of object categories, as well as how to incorporate large language models (like GPT-3) to boost zero-shot applications.

<p>Abstract: The development of learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression models has recently attracted significant interest. Existing models predominantly utilize convolutional filters, which capture only local dependencies. Furthermore,they often incur high training costs and exhibit substantial computational complexity. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose Hyperspectral Compression Transformer (HyCoT) that is a transformer-based autoencoder for pixelwise HSI compression. Additionally, we apply a simple yet effective training set reduction approach to accelerate the training process. Experimental results on the HySpecNet-11k dataset demonstrate that HyCoT surpasses the state of the art across various compression ratios by over 1 dB of PSNR with significantly reduced computational requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Johannes Claasen, Johan Pieter de Villiers</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel online MOT algorithm, IMM Joint Homography State Estimation (IMM-JHSE), is proposed. IMM-JHSE uses an initial homography estimate as the only additional 3D information, whereas other 3D MOT methods use regular 3D measurements. By jointly modelling the homography matrix and its dynamics as part of track state vectors, IMM-JHSE removes the explicit influence of camera motion compensation techniques on predicted track position states, which was prevalent in previous approaches. Expanding upon this, static and dynamic camera motion models are combined using an IMM filter. A simple bounding box motion model is used to predict bounding box positions to incorporate image plane information. In addition to applying an IMM to camera motion, a non-standard IMM approach is applied where bounding-box-based BIoU scores are mixed with ground-plane-based Mahalanobis distances in an IMM-like fashion to perform association only, making IMM-JHSE robust to motion away from the ground plane. Finally, IMM-JHSE makes use of dynamic process and measurement noise estimation techniques. IMM-JHSE improves upon related techniques, including UCMCTrack, OC-SORT, C-BIoU and ByteTrack on the DanceTrack and KITTI-car datasets, increasing HOTA by 2.64 and 2.11, respectively, while offering competitive performance on the MOT17, MOT20 and KITTI-pedestrian datasets. Using publicly available detections, IMM-JHSE outperforms almost all other 2D MOT methods and is outperformed only by 3D MOT methods -- some of which are offline -- on the KITTI-car dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weixiang Gao, Yifan Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, the diagnosis of facial paralysis remains a challenging task, often relying heavily on the subjective judgment and experience of clinicians, which can introduce variability and uncertainty in the assessment process. One promising application in real-life situations is the automatic estimation of facial paralysis. However, the scarcity of facial paralysis datasets limits the development of robust machine learning models for automated diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. To this end, this study aims to synthesize a high-quality facial paralysis dataset to address this gap, enabling more accurate and efficient algorithm training. Specifically, a novel Cross-Fusion Cycle Palsy Expression Generative Model (CFCPalsy) based on the diffusion model is proposed to combine different features of facial information and enhance the visual details of facial appearance and texture in facial regions, thus creating synthetic facial images that accurately represent various degrees and types of facial paralysis. We have qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the proposed method on the commonly used public clinical datasets of facial paralysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods, generating more realistic facial images and maintaining identity consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixia Ma, Puning Yang, Yuting Xu, Ziming Yang, Peipei Li, Huaibo Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, the rapid development of computer vision and deep learning has enabled the creation or manipulation of high-fidelity facial images and videos via deep generative approaches. This technology, also known as deepfake, has achieved dramatic progress and become increasingly popular in social media. However, the technology can generate threats to personal privacy and national security by spreading misinformation. To diminish the risks of deepfake, it is desirable to develop powerful forgery detection methods to distinguish fake faces from real faces. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent deep learning-based approaches for facial forgery detection. We attempt to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of the current advances as well as the major challenges for deepfake detection based on deep learning. We present an overview of deepfake techniques and analyse the characteristics of various deepfake datasets. We then provide a systematic review of different categories of deepfake detection and state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods. The drawbacks of existing detection methods are analyzed, and future research directions are discussed to address the challenges in improving both the performance and generalization of deepfake detection.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03979">Improving Arabic Multi-Label Emotion Classification using Stacked Embeddings and Hybrid Loss Function</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Azeem Aslam, Wang Jun, Nisar Ahmed, Muhammad Imran Zaman, Li Yanan, Hu Hongfei, Wang Shiyu, Xin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-label emotion classification, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, the challenges of class imbalance and label correlation hinder model performance, especially in accurately predicting minority emotions. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel approach that combines stacked embeddings, meta-learning, and a hybrid loss function to enhance multi-label emotion classification for the Arabic language. The study extracts contextual embeddings from three fine-tuned language models-ArabicBERT, MarBERT, and AraBERT-which are then stacked to form enriched embeddings. A meta-learner is trained on these stacked embeddings, and the resulting concatenated representations are provided as input to a Bi-LSTM model, followed by a fully connected neural network for multi-label classification. To further improve performance, a hybrid loss function is introduced, incorporating class weighting, label correlation matrix, and contrastive learning, effectively addressing class imbalances and improving the handling of label correlations. Extensive experiments validate the proposed model's performance across key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Jaccard Accuracy, and Hamming Loss. The class-wise performance analysis demonstrates the hybrid loss function's ability to significantly reduce disparities between majority and minority classes, resulting in a more balanced emotion classification. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each component, showing the superiority of the model compared to baseline approaches and other loss functions. This study not only advances multi-label emotion classification for Arabic but also presents a generalizable framework that can be adapted to other languages and domains, providing a significant step forward in addressing the challenges of low-resource emotion classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> You Qin, Wei Ji, Xinze Lan, Hao Fei, Xun Yang, Dan Guo, Roger Zimmermann, Lizi Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Cai, Zihao Wang, Kewei Lian, Zhancun Mu, Xiaojian Ma, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance. Codes and demos are now available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Ssu-Chi Kuai, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, most of them were black-box systems which faced challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expertdriven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence Monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure with different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleVM uses the state-of-the-art YOLOWorld model to detect objects in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual-branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse-grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleVM achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and finegrained monitoring, significantly outperforming existing state-ofthe-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Fu, Xiao Zhang, Sepideh Pashami, Fatemeh Rahimian, Anders Holst</p>
<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving adversarial machine learning landscape, developing effective defenses against patch attacks has become a critical challenge, necessitating reliable solutions to safeguard real-world AI systems. Although diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis and have been recently utilized to counter $\ell_p$-norm bounded attacks, their potential in mitigating localized patch attacks remains largely underexplored. In this work, we propose DiffPAD, a novel framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models for adversarial patch decontamination. DiffPAD first performs super-resolution restoration on downsampled input images, then adopts binarization, dynamic thresholding scheme and sliding window for effective localization of adversarial patches. Such a design is inspired by the theoretically derived correlation between patch size and diffusion restoration error that is generalized across diverse patch attack scenarios. Finally, DiffPAD applies inpainting techniques to the original input images with the estimated patch region being masked. By integrating closed-form solutions for super-resolution restoration and image inpainting into the conditional reverse sampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model, DiffPAD obviates the need for text guidance or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DiffPAD not only achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness against patch attacks but also excels in recovering naturalistic images without patch remnants.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiquan Huang, Aoqi Wu, Yifan Yang, Xufang Luo, Yuqing Yang, Liang Hu, Qi Dai, Xiyang Dai, Dongdong Chen, Chong Luo, Lili Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: CLIP is one of the most important multimodal foundational models today. What powers CLIP's capabilities? The rich supervision signals provided by natural language, the carrier of human knowledge, shape a powerful cross-modal representation space. However, with the rapid advancements in large language models LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA, the boundaries of language comprehension and generation are continually being pushed. This raises an intriguing question: can the capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to further improve multimodal representation learning? The potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into CLIP are clear. LLMs' strong textual understanding can fundamentally improve CLIP's ability to handle image captions, drastically enhancing its ability to process long and complex texts, a well-known limitation of vanilla CLIP. Moreover, LLMs are trained on a vast corpus of text, possessing open-world knowledge. This allows them to expand on caption information during training, increasing the efficiency of the learning process. In this paper, we propose LLM2CLIP, a novel approach that embraces the power of LLMs to unlock CLIP's potential. By fine-tuning the LLM in the caption space with contrastive learning, we extract its textual capabilities into the output embeddings, significantly improving the output layer's textual discriminability. We then design an efficient training process where the fine-tuned LLM acts as a powerful teacher for CLIP's visual encoder. Thanks to the LLM's presence, we can now incorporate longer and more complex captions without being restricted by vanilla CLIP's text encoder's context window and ability limitations. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach brings substantial improvements in cross-modal tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks(KANs), as a theoretically efficient neural network architecture, have garnered attention for their potential in capturing complex patterns. However, their application in computer vision remains relatively unexplored. This study first analyzes the potential of KAN in computer vision tasks, evaluating the performance of KAN and its convolutional variants in image classification and semantic segmentation. The focus is placed on examining their characteristics across varying data scales and noise levels. Results indicate that while KAN exhibits stronger fitting capabilities, it is highly sensitive to noise, limiting its robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a smoothness regularization method and introduce a Segment Deactivation technique. Both approaches enhance KAN's stability and generalization, demonstrating its potential in handling complex visual data tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Qi, Tao Cai, Xiyue Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has dominated novel-view synthesis with its real-time rendering speed and state-of-the-art rendering quality. However, during the rendering process, the use of the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projection transformation leads to inevitable errors, resulting in blurriness, artifacts and a lack of scene consistency in the final rendered images. To address this issue, we introduce an ellipsoid-based projection method to calculate the projection of Gaussian ellipsoid onto the image plane, which is the primitive of 3D Gaussian Splatting. As our proposed ellipsoid-based projection method cannot handle Gaussian ellipsoids with camera origins inside them or parts lying below $z=0$ plane in the camera space, we designed a pre-filtering strategy. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets show that our ellipsoid-based projection method can enhance the rendering quality of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its extensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.</p>

Building on this, the Mixed-Control Diffusion implicitly aligns the scale and body shape of diverse characters with motion guidance, allowing flexible control of local character motion. Subsequently, a Motion-Adaptive Normalization module is incorporated to effectively inject global scene motion, paving the way for comprehensive character art animation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MikuDance across various character art and motion guidance, consistently producing high-quality animations with remarkable motion dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyang Li, Xuanting Hao, Ronghua Shang, Licheng Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: In view of the fact that semi- and self-supervised learning share a fundamental principle, effectively modeling knowledge from unlabeled data, various semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods have integrated representative self-supervised learning paradigms for further regularization. However, the potential of the state-of-the-art generative self-supervised paradigm, masked image modeling, has been scarcely studied. This paradigm learns the knowledge through establishing connections between the masked and visible parts of masked image, during the pixel reconstruction process. By inheriting and extending this insight, we successfully leverage masked image modeling to boost semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel class-wise masked image modeling that independently reconstructs different image regions according to their respective classes. In this way, the mask-induced connections are established within each class, mitigating the semantic confusion that arises from plainly reconstructing images in basic masked image modeling. To strengthen these intra-class connections, we further develop a feature aggregation strategy that minimizes the distances between features corresponding to the masked and visible parts within the same class. Additionally, in semantic space, we explore the application of masked image modeling to enhance regularization. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/haoxt/S4MIM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose: Eye morphology varies significantly across the population, especially for the orbit and optic nerve. These variations limit the feasibility and robustness of generalizing population-wise features of eye organs to an unbiased spatial reference.
  Approach: To tackle these limitations, we propose a process for creating high-resolution unbiased eye atlases. First, to restore spatial details from scans with a low through-plane resolution compared to a high in-plane resolution, we apply a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm. Then, we generate an initial unbiased reference with an iterative metric-based registration using a small portion of subject scans. We register the remaining scans to this template and refine the template using an unsupervised deep probabilistic approach that generates a more expansive deformation field to enhance the organ boundary alignment. We demonstrate this framework using magnetic resonance images across four different tissue contrasts, generating four atlases in separate spatial alignments.
  Results: For each tissue contrast, we find a significant improvement using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in the average Dice score across four labeled regions compared to a standard registration framework consisting of rigid, affine, and deformable transformations. These results highlight the effective alignment of eye organs and boundaries using our proposed process.
  Conclusions: By combining super-resolution preprocessing and deep probabilistic models, we address the challenge of generating an eye atlas to serve as a standardized reference across a largely variable population.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer F. Atli, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Mahmut Yurt, Onat Dalmaz, Tolga \c{C}ukur</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have pushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local filtering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity comes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise learning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets. Here, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image synthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to efficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do this, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck of a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn context across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to learn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive demonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in synthesizing target-modality images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Pinkard, Leyla Kabuli, Eric Markley, Tiffany Chien, Jiantao Jiao, Laura Waller</p>
<p>Abstract: Most modern imaging systems process the data they capture algorithmically before-or instead of-human viewing. As a result, performance depends not on how interpretable the measurements appear, but how effectively they encode details for algorithmic processing. Information theory provides mathematical tools to analyze this, but developing methods that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use has proven challenging. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating the information content of imaging system measurements. Our framework requires only experimental measurements and noise characterization, with no need for ground truth data. We demonstrate that these information estimates reliably predict system performance across diverse imaging modalities, including color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and label-free microscopy. To automate the process of designing imaging systems that maximize information capture we introduce an optimization technique called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Lorenz, Mario Fernandez, Jens M\"uller, Ullrich K\"othe</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying deep learning models in real-world scenarios. In recent years, many OOD detectors have been developed, and even the benchmarking has been standardized, i.e. OpenOOD. The number of post-hoc detectors is growing fast. They are showing an option to protect a pre-trained classifier against natural distribution shifts and claim to be ready for real-world scenarios. However, its effectiveness in dealing with adversarial examples (AdEx) has been neglected in most studies. In cases where an OOD detector includes AdEx in its experiments, the lack of uniform parameters for AdEx makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of the OOD detector. This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of 16 post-hoc detectors against various evasion attacks. It also discusses a roadmap for adversarial defense in OOD detectors that would help adversarial robustness. We believe that level 1 (AdEx on a unified dataset) should be added to any OOD detector to see the limitations. The last level in the roadmap (defense against adaptive attacks) we added for integrity from an adversarial machine learning (AML) point of view, which we do not believe is the ultimate goal for OOD detectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyuan Li, Junqi Liao, Chuanbo Tang, Haotian Zhang, Yuqi Li, Yifan Bian, Xihua Sheng, Xinmin Feng, Yao Li, Changsheng Gao, Li Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Image/video coding has been a remarkable research area for both academia and industry for many years. Testing datasets, especially high-quality image/video datasets are desirable for the justified evaluation of coding-related research, practical applications, and standardization activities. We put forward a test dataset namely USTC-TD, which has been successfully adopted in the practical end-to-end image/video coding challenge of the IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and lmage Processing (VCIP) in 2022 and 2023. USTC-TD contains 40 images at 4K spatial resolution and 10 video sequences at 1080p spatial resolution, featuring various content due to the diverse environmental factors (e.g. scene type, texture, motion, view) and the designed imaging factors (e.g. illumination, lens, shadow). We quantitatively evaluate USTC-TD on different image/video features (spatial, temporal, color, lightness), and compare it with the previous image/video test datasets, which verifies the wider coverage and more diversity of the proposed dataset. We also evaluate both classic standardized and recent learned image/video coding schemes on USTC-TD with PSNR and MS-SSIM, and provide an extensive benchmark for the evaluated schemes. Based on the characteristics and specific design of the proposed test dataset, we analyze the benchmark performance and shed light on the future research and development of image/video coding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Wen, Yichen Zhu, Jinming Li, Minjie Zhu, Kun Wu, Zhiyuan Xu, Ning Liu, Ran Cheng, Chaomin Shen, Yaxin Peng, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Yun Wang, Zhengyang Geng, Hongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast, consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID 1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06503">Diffusion Sampling Correction via Approximately 10 Parameters</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyi Wang, Wei Peng, Lijiang Li, Wenyu Chen, Yuren Cai, Songzhi Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in generative tasks, but this comes at the expense of sampling efficiency. To enhance sampling speed without sacrificing quality, various distillation-based accelerated sampling algorithms have been recently proposed. However, they typically require significant additional training costs and model parameter storage, which limit their practical application. In this work, we propose PCA-based Adaptive Search (PAS), which optimizes existing solvers for DPMs with minimal learnable parameters and training costs. Specifically, we first employ PCA to obtain a few orthogonal unit basis vectors to span the high-dimensional sampling space, which enables us to learn just a set of coordinates to correct the sampling direction; furthermore, based on the observation that the cumulative truncation error exhibits an ``S''-shape, we design an adaptive search strategy that further enhances the sampling efficiency and reduces the number of stored parameters to approximately 10. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAS can significantly enhance existing fast solvers in a plug-and-play manner with negligible costs. For instance, on CIFAR10, PAS requires only 12 parameters and less than 1 minute of training on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to optimize the DDIM from 15.69 FID (NFE=10) to 4.37.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06651">Machine learning-enabled velocity model building with uncertainty quantification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Orozco, Huseyin Tuna Erdinc, Yunlin Zeng, Mathias Louboutin, Felix J. Herrmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately characterizing migration velocity models is crucial for a wide range of geophysical applications, from hydrocarbon exploration to monitoring of CO2 sequestration projects. Traditional velocity model building methods such as Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) are powerful but often struggle with the inherent complexities of the inverse problem, including noise, limited bandwidth, receiver aperture and computational constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable methodology that integrates generative modeling, in the form of Diffusion networks, with physics-informed summary statistics, making it suitable for complicated imaging problems including field datasets. By defining these summary statistics in terms of subsurface-offset image volumes for poor initial velocity models, our approach allows for computationally efficient generation of Bayesian posterior samples for migration velocity models that offer a useful assessment of uncertainty. To validate our approach, we introduce a battery of tests that measure the quality of the inferred velocity models, as well as the quality of the inferred uncertainties. With modern synthetic datasets, we reconfirm gains from using subsurface-image gathers as the conditioning observable. For complex velocity model building involving salt, we propose a new iterative workflow that refines amortized posterior approximations with salt flooding and demonstrate how the uncertainty in the velocity model can be propagated to the final product reverse time migrated images. Finally, we present a proof of concept on field datasets to show that our method can scale to industry-sized problems.</p>
