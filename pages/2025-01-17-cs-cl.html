<p><b>Authors:</b> Sneheel Sarangi, Maha Elgarf, Hanan Salam</p>
<p>Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand and reflect on the mental states of others. Although this capability is crucial for human interaction, testing on Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals that they possess only a rudimentary understanding of it. Although the most capable closed-source LLMs have come close to human performance on some ToM tasks, they still perform poorly on complex variations of the task that involve more structured reasoning. In this work, we utilize the concept of "pretend-play", or ``Simulation Theory'' from cognitive psychology to propose ``Decompose-ToM'': an LLM-based inference algorithm that improves model performance on complex ToM tasks. We recursively simulate user perspectives and decompose the ToM task into a simpler set of functions: subject identification, question-reframing, world model updation, and knowledge availability. We test the algorithm on higher-order ToM tasks and a task testing for ToM capabilities in a conversational setting, demonstrating that our approach shows significant improvement across models compared to baseline methods while requiring minimal prompt tuning across tasks and no additional model training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hefei Qiu, Brian White, Ashley Ding, Reinaldo Costa, Ali Hachem, Wei Ding, Ping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong general capabilities in many applications. However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Conrad Borchers, Danielle R. Thomas, Jionghao Lin, Ralph Abboud, Kenneth R. Koedinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o can help automate text classification tasks at low cost and scale. However, there are major concerns about the validity and reliability of LLM outputs. By contrast, human coding is generally more reliable but expensive to procure at scale. In this study, we propose a hybrid solution to leverage the strengths of both. We combine human-coded data and synthetic LLM-produced data to fine-tune a classical machine learning classifier, distilling both into a smaller BERT model. We evaluate our method on a human-coded test set as a validity measure for LLM output quality. In three experiments, we systematically vary LLM-generated samples' size, variety, and consistency, informed by best practices in LLM tuning. Our findings indicate that augmenting datasets with synthetic samples improves classifier performance, with optimal results achieved at an 80% synthetic to 20% human-coded data ratio. Lower temperature settings of 0.3, corresponding to less variability in LLM generations, produced more stable improvements but also limited model learning from augmented samples. In contrast, higher temperature settings (0.7 and above) introduced greater variability in performance estimates and, at times, lower performance. Hence, LLMs may produce more uniform output that classifiers overfit to earlier or produce more diverse output that runs the risk of deteriorating model performance through information irrelevant to the prediction task. Filtering out inconsistent synthetic samples did not enhance performance. We conclude that integrating human and LLM-generated data to improve text classification models in assessment offers a scalable solution that leverages both the accuracy of human coding and the variety of LLM outputs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09127">Multilingual LLMs Struggle to Link Orthography and Semantics in Bilingual Word Processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eshaan Tanwar, Gayatri Oke, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilingual lexical processing is shaped by the complex interplay of phonological, orthographic, and semantic features of two languages within an integrated mental lexicon. In humans, this is evident in the ease with which cognate words - words similar in both orthographic form and meaning (e.g., blind, meaning "sightless" in both English and German) - are processed, compared to the challenges posed by interlingual homographs, which share orthographic form but differ in meaning (e.g., gift, meaning "present" in English but "poison" in German). We investigate how multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) handle such phenomena, focusing on English-Spanish, English-French, and English-German cognates, non-cognate, and interlingual homographs. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to disambiguate meanings and make semantic judgments, both when these word types are presented in isolation or within sentence contexts. Our findings reveal that while certain LLMs demonstrate strong performance in recognizing cognates and non-cognates in isolation, they exhibit significant difficulty in disambiguating interlingual homographs, often performing below random baselines. This suggests LLMs tend to rely heavily on orthographic similarities rather than semantic understanding when interpreting interlingual homographs. Further, we find LLMs exhibit difficulty in retrieving word meanings, with performance in isolative disambiguation tasks having no correlation with semantic understanding. Finally, we study how the LLM processes interlingual homographs in incongruent sentences. We find models to opt for different strategies in understanding English and non-English homographs, highlighting a lack of a unified approach to handling cross-lingual ambiguities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yevhen Kostiuk, Oxana Vitman, {\L}ukasz Gaga{\l}a, Artur Kiulian</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we evaluated Lithuanian and general history knowledge of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) on a multiple-choice question-answering task. The models were tested on a dataset of Lithuanian national and general history questions translated into Baltic, Nordic, and other languages (English, Ukrainian, Arabic) to assess the knowledge sharing from culturally and historically connected groups. We evaluated GPT-4o, LLaMa3.1 8b and 70b, QWEN2.5 7b and 72b, Mistral Nemo 12b, LLaMa3 8b, Mistral 7b, LLaMa3.2 3b, and Nordic fine-tuned models (GPT-SW3 and LLaMa3 8b).
  Our results show that GPT-4o consistently outperformed all other models across language groups, with slightly better results for Baltic and Nordic languages. Larger open-source models like QWEN2.5 72b and LLaMa3.1 70b performed well but showed weaker alignment with Baltic languages. Smaller models (Mistral Nemo 12b, LLaMa3.2 3b, QWEN 7B, LLaMa3.1 8B, and LLaMa3 8b) demonstrated gaps with LT-related alignment with Baltic languages while performing better on Nordic and other languages. The Nordic fine-tuned models did not surpass multilingual models, indicating that shared cultural or historical context alone does not guarantee better performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephanie L. Day, Jacapo Cirica, Steven R. Clapp, Veronika Penkova, Amy E. Giroux, Abbey Banta, Catherine Bordeau, Poojitha Mutteneni, Ben D. Sawyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds great promise as a tool to support personalized learning. Teachers need tools to efficiently and effectively enhance content readability of educational texts so that they are matched to individual students reading levels, while retaining key details. Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential to fill this need, but previous research notes multiple shortcomings in current approaches. In this study, we introduced a generalized approach and metrics for the systematic evaluation of the accuracy and consistency in which LLMs, prompting techniques, and a novel multi-agent architecture to simplify sixty informational reading passages, reducing each from the twelfth grade level down to the eighth, sixth, and fourth grade levels. We calculated the degree to which each LLM and prompting technique accurately achieved the targeted grade level for each passage, percentage change in word count, and consistency in maintaining keywords and key phrases (semantic similarity). One-sample t-tests and multiple regression models revealed significant differences in the best performing LLM and prompt technique for each of the four metrics. Both LLMs and prompting techniques demonstrated variable utility in grade level accuracy and consistency of keywords and key phrases when attempting to level content down to the fourth grade reading level. These results demonstrate the promise of the application of LLMs for efficient and precise automated text simplification, the shortcomings of current models and prompting methods in attaining an ideal balance across various evaluation criteria, and a generalizable method to evaluate future systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yevhen Kostiuk, Oxana Vitman, {\L}ukasz Gaga{\l}a, Artur Kiulian</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on the short answer matching task for Latvian and Lithuanian languages. We introduce novel datasets consisting of 502 Latvian and 690 Lithuanian question-answer pairs. For each question-answer pair, we generated matched and non-matched answers using a set of alteration rules specifically designed to introduce small but meaningful changes in the text. These generated answers serve as test cases to assess the ability of LLMs to detect subtle differences in matching of the original answers. A subset of the datasets was manually verified for quality and accuracy. Our results show that while larger LLMs, such as QWEN2.5 72b and LLaMa3.1 70b, demonstrate near-perfect performance in distinguishing matched and non-matched answers, smaller models show more variance. For instance, LLaMa3.1 8b and EuroLLM 9b benefited from few-shot examples, while Mistral Nemo 12b underperformed on detection of subtle text alteration, particularly in Lithuanian, even with additional examples. QWEN2.5 7b and Mistral 7b were able to obtain a strong and comparable performance to the larger 70b models in zero and few shot experiments. Moreover, the performance of Mistral 7b was weaker in few shot experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhou Yu, Tianhao Cheng, Ying Cheng, Rui Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical applications such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the advanced reasoning required for complex clinical scenarios, such as differential diagnosis or personalized treatment suggestions. We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghao Liu, Mengyu Li, Wei Pang, Fausto Giunchiglia, Lan Huang, Xiaoyue Feng, Renchu Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Short text classification, as a research subtopic in natural language processing, is more challenging due to its semantic sparsity and insufficient labeled samples in practical scenarios. We propose a novel model named MI-DELIGHT for short text classification in this work. Specifically, it first performs multi-source information (i.e., statistical information, linguistic information, and factual information) exploration to alleviate the sparsity issues. Then, the graph learning approach is adopted to learn the representation of short texts, which are presented in graph forms. Moreover, we introduce a dual-level (i.e., instance-level and cluster-level) contrastive learning auxiliary task to effectively capture different-grained contrastive information within massive unlabeled data. Meanwhile, previous models merely perform the main task and auxiliary tasks in parallel, without considering the relationship among tasks. Therefore, we introduce a hierarchical architecture to explicitly model the correlations between tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets, demonstrating that MI-DELIGHT significantly surpasses previous competitive models. It even outperforms popular large language models on several datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghao Liu, Fausto Giunchiglia, Lan Huang, Ximing Li, Xiaoyue Feng, Renchu Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Short text classification has gained significant attention in the information age due to its prevalence and real-world applications. Recent advancements in graph learning combined with contrastive learning have shown promising results in addressing the challenges of semantic sparsity and limited labeled data in short text classification. However, existing models have certain limitations. They rely on explicit data augmentation techniques to generate contrastive views, resulting in semantic corruption and noise. Additionally, these models only focus on learning the intrinsic consistency between the generated views, neglecting valuable discriminative information from other potential views. To address these issues, we propose a Simple graph contrastive learning framework for Short Text Classification (SimSTC). Our approach involves performing graph learning on multiple text-related component graphs to obtain multi-view text embeddings. Subsequently, we directly apply contrastive learning on these embeddings. Notably, our method eliminates the need for data augmentation operations to generate contrastive views while still leveraging the benefits of multi-view contrastive learning. Despite its simplicity, our model achieves outstanding performance, surpassing large language models on various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takaaki Hori, Martin Kocour, Adnan Haider, Erik McDermott, Xiaodan Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an efficient decoding approach for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Although shallow fusion is the most common approach to incorporate language models into E2E-ASR decoding, we face two practical problems with LLMs. (1) LLM inference is computationally costly. (2) There may be a vocabulary mismatch between the ASR model and the LLM. To resolve this mismatch, we need to retrain the ASR model and/or the LLM, which is at best time-consuming and in many cases not feasible. We propose "delayed fusion," which applies LLM scores to ASR hypotheses with a delay during decoding and enables easier use of pre-trained LLMs in ASR tasks. This method can reduce not only the number of hypotheses scored by the LLM but also the number of LLM inference calls. It also allows re-tokenizion of ASR hypotheses during decoding if ASR and LLM employ different tokenizations. We demonstrate that delayed fusion provides improved decoding speed and accuracy compared to shallow fusion and N-best rescoring using the LibriHeavy ASR corpus and three public LLMs, OpenLLaMA 3B & 7B and Mistral 7B.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolong Wang, Yuanchi Zhang, Ziyue Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Fuwen Luo, Yile Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling remarkable progress in various tasks. Different from objective tasks such as commonsense reasoning and arithmetic question-answering, the performance of LLMs on subjective tasks is still limited, where the perspective on the specific problem plays crucial roles for better interpreting the context and giving proper response. For example, in certain scenarios, LLMs may perform better when answering from an expert role perspective, potentially eliciting their relevant domain knowledge. In contrast, in some scenarios, LLMs may provide more accurate responses when answering from a third-person standpoint, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potentially mitigating inherent biases. In this paper, we propose Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method based on in-context learning that enables LLMs to dynamically select among direct, role, and third-person perspectives for the best way to solve corresponding subjective problem. Through extensive experiments on totally 12 subjective tasks by using both closed-source and open-source LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and Qwen-2, our method outperforms widely used single fixed perspective based methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and expert prompting, highlights the intricate ways that LLMs can adapt their perspectives to provide nuanced and contextually appropriate responses for different problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh D. Dhole</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation equips large language models with the capability to retrieve external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations by incorporating information beyond the model's intrinsic abilities. However, most prior works have focused on invoking retrieval deterministically, which makes it unsuitable for tasks such as long-form question answering. Instead, dynamically performing retrieval by invoking it only when the underlying LLM lacks the required knowledge can be more efficient. In this context, we delve deeper into the question, "To Retrieve or Not to Retrieve?" by exploring multiple uncertainty detection methods. We evaluate these methods for the task of long-form question answering, employing dynamic retrieval, and present our comparisons. Our findings suggest that uncertainty detection metrics, such as Degree Matrix Jaccard and Eccentricity, can reduce the number of retrieval calls by almost half, with only a slight reduction in question-answering accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted to perform text-to-SQL tasks, utilizing their in-context learning (ICL) capability to translate natural language questions into structured query language (SQL). However, such a technique faces correctness problems and requires efficient repairing solutions. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of text-to-SQL errors. Our study covers four representative ICL-based techniques, five basic repairing methods, two benchmarks, and two LLM settings. We find that text-to-SQL errors are widespread and summarize 29 error types of 7 categories. We also find that existing repairing attempts have limited correctness improvement at the cost of high computational overhead with many mis-repairs. Based on the findings, we propose MapleRepair, a novel text-to-SQL error detection and repairing framework. The evaluation demonstrates that MapleRepair outperforms existing solutions by repairing 13.8% more queries with neglectable mis-repairs and 67.4% less overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Barack Wamkaya Wanjawa, Lawrence Muchemi, Evans Miriti</p>
<p>Abstract: Processing low-resource languages, such as Kiswahili, using machine learning is difficult due to lack of adequate training data. However, such low-resource languages are still important for human communication and are already in daily use and users need practical machine processing tasks such as summarization, disambiguation and even question answering (QA). One method of processing such languages, while bypassing the need for training data, is the use semantic networks. Some low resource languages, such as Kiswahili, are of the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, and similarly semantic networks are a triple of subject-predicate-object, hence SVO parts of speech tags can map into a semantic network triple. An algorithm to process raw natural language text and map it into a semantic network is therefore necessary and desirable in structuring low resource languages texts. This algorithm tested on the Kiswahili QA task with upto 78.6% exact match.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective chart summary can significantly reduce the time and effort decision makers spend interpreting charts, enabling precise and efficient communication of data insights. Previous studies have faced challenges in generating accurate and semantically rich summaries of time-series data charts. In this paper, we identify summary elements and common hallucination types in the generation of time-series chart summaries, which serve as our guidelines for automatic generation. We introduce ChartInsighter, which automatically generates chart summaries of time-series data, effectively reducing hallucinations in chart summary generation. Specifically, we assign multiple agents to generate the initial chart summary and collaborate iteratively, during which they invoke external data analysis modules to extract insights and compile them into a coherent summary. Additionally, we implement a self-consistency test method to validate and correct our summary. We create a high-quality benchmark of charts and summaries, with hallucination types annotated on a sentence-by-sentence basis, facilitating the evaluation of the effectiveness of reducing hallucinations. Our evaluations using our benchmark show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art models, and that our summary hallucination rate is the lowest, which effectively reduces various hallucinations and improves summary quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus Lovon (IRIT-IRIS), Martin Mouysset (IRIT-IRIS), Jo Oleiwan (IRIT-IRIS), Jose G. Moreno (IRIT-IRIS), Christine Damase-Michel (IRIT-IRIS), Lynda Tamine (IRIT-IRIS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) tables pose unique challenges among which is the presence of hidden contextual dependencies between medical features with a high level of data dimensionality and sparsity. This study presents the first investigation into the abilities of LLMs to comprehend EHRs for patient data extraction and retrieval. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMICSQL dataset to explore the impact of the prompt structure, instruction, context, and demonstration, of two backbone LLMs, Llama2 and Meditron, based on task performance. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, our findings show that optimal feature selection and serialization methods can enhance task performance by up to 26.79% compared to naive approaches. Similarly, in-context learning setups with relevant example selection improve data extraction performance by 5.95%. Based on our study findings, we propose guidelines that we believe would help the design of LLM-based models to support health search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beatrice Savoldi, Eleonora Cupin, Manjinder Thind, Anne Lauscher, Luisa Bentivogli</p>
<p>Abstract: Gender-neutral language reflects societal and linguistic shifts towards greater inclusivity by avoiding the implication that one gender is the norm over others. This is particularly relevant for grammatical gender languages, which heavily encode the gender of terms for human referents and over-relies on masculine forms, even when gender is unspecified or irrelevant. Language technologies are known to mirror these inequalities, being affected by a male bias and perpetuating stereotypical associations when translating into languages with extensive gendered morphology. In such cases, gender-neutral language can help avoid undue binary assumptions. However, despite its importance for creating fairer multi- and cross-lingual technologies, inclusive language research remains scarce and insufficiently supported in current resources. To address this gap, we present the multilingual mGeNTe dataset. Derived from the bilingual GeNTE (Piergentili et al., 2023), mGeNTE extends the original corpus to include the English-Italian/German/Spanish language pairs. Since each language pair is English-aligned with gendered and neutral sentences in the target languages, mGeNTE enables research in both automatic Gender-Neutral Translation (GNT) and language modelling for three grammatical gender languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional in-person psychological counseling remains primarily niche, often chosen by individuals with psychological issues, while online automated counseling offers a potential solution for those hesitant to seek help due to feelings of shame. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an essential and widely used approach in psychological counseling. The advent of large language models (LLMs) and agent technology enables automatic CBT diagnosis and treatment. However, current LLM-based CBT systems use agents with a fixed structure, limiting their self-optimization capabilities, or providing hollow, unhelpful suggestions due to redundant response patterns. In this work, we utilize Quora-like and YiXinLi single-round consultation models to build a general agent framework that generates high-quality responses for single-turn psychological consultation scenarios. We use a bilingual dataset to evaluate the quality of single-response consultations generated by each framework. Then, we incorporate dynamic routing and supervisory mechanisms inspired by real psychological counseling to construct a CBT-oriented autonomous multi-agent framework, demonstrating its general applicability. Experimental results indicate that AutoCBT can provide higher-quality automated psychological counseling services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> King-kui Sin, Xi Xuan, Chunyu Kit, Clara Ho-yan Chan, Honic Ho-kin Ip</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's bilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the Basic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal, linguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law remains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth of judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys sporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with the thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the government acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a sustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that translating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis analyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A proposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a human-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major transitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to using a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it evolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach, supported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of judicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and continuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual legal system.</p>

Our method addresses key limitations of the standard two-pipeline approach by unifying arc scoring and labeling into a single network, reducing scalability issues caused by the information bottleneck and lack of parameter sharing. Additionally, our architecture overcomes limited arc interactions with transformer layers to efficiently simulate higher-order dependencies. Experiments on PTB and UD show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art parsers in both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaocheng Liu, Quan Tu, Wen Ye, Yu Xiao, Zhishou Zhang, Hengfu Cui, Yalun Zhu, Qiang Ju, Shizheng Li, Jian Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Online medical consultation (OMC) restricts doctors to gathering patient information solely through inquiries, making the already complex sequential decision-making process of diagnosis even more challenging. Recently, the rapid advancement of large language models has demonstrated a significant potential to transform OMC. However, most studies have primarily focused on improving diagnostic accuracy under conditions of relatively sufficient information, while paying limited attention to the "inquiry" phase of the consultation process. This lack of focus has left the relationship between "inquiry" and "diagnosis" insufficiently explored. In this paper, we first extract real patient interaction strategies from authentic doctor-patient conversations and use these strategies to guide the training of a patient simulator that closely mirrors real-world behavior. By inputting medical records into our patient simulator to simulate patient responses, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the relationship between "inquiry" and "diagnosis" in the consultation process. Experimental results demonstrate that inquiry and diagnosis adhere to the Liebig's law: poor inquiry quality limits the effectiveness of diagnosis, regardless of diagnostic capability, and vice versa. Furthermore, the experiments reveal significant differences in the inquiry performance of various models. To investigate this phenomenon, we categorize the inquiry process into four types: (1) chief complaint inquiry; (2) specification of known symptoms; (3) inquiry about accompanying symptoms; and (4) gathering family or medical history. We analyze the distribution of inquiries across the four types for different models to explore the reasons behind their significant performance differences. We plan to open-source the weights and related code of our patient simulator at https://github.com/LIO-H-ZEN/PatientSimulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enes Yavuz Ugan, Ngoc-Quan Pham, Leonard B\"armann, Alex Waibel</p>
<p>Abstract: Code-switching, the alternation of languages within a single discourse, presents a significant challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition. Despite the unique nature of the task, performance is commonly measured with established metrics such as Word-Error-Rate (WER). However, in this paper, we question whether these general metrics accurately assess performance on code-switching. Specifically, using both Connectionist-Temporal-Classification and Encoder-Decoder models, we show fine-tuning on non-code-switched data from both matrix and embedded language improves classical metrics on code-switching test sets, although actual code-switched words worsen (as expected). Therefore, we propose Point-of-Interest Error Rate (PIER), a variant of WER that focuses only on specific words of interest. We instantiate PIER on code-switched utterances and show that this more accurately describes the code-switching performance, showing huge room for improvement in future work. This focused evaluation allows for a more precise assessment of model performance, particularly in challenging aspects such as inter-word and intra-word code-switching.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hajime Kiyama, Taichi Aida, Mamoru Komachi, Toshinobu Ogiso, Hiroya Takamura, Daichi Mochihashi</p>
<p>Abstract: The meanings and relationships of words shift over time. This phenomenon is referred to as semantic shift.Research focused on understanding how semantic shifts occur over multiple time periods is essential for gaining a detailed understanding of semantic shifts.However, detecting change points only between adjacent time periods is insufficient for analyzing detailed semantic shifts, and using BERT-based methods to examine word sense proportions incurs a high computational cost.To address those issues, we propose a simple yet intuitive framework for how semantic shifts occur over multiple time periods by leveraging a similarity matrix between the embeddings of the same word through time.We compute a diachronic word similarity matrix using fast and lightweight word embeddings across arbitrary time periods, making it deeper to analyze continuous semantic shifts.Additionally, by clustering the similarity matrices for different words, we can categorize words that exhibit similar behavior of semantic shift in an unsupervised manner.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advent of Web 2.0, the development in social technology coupled with global communication systematically brought positive and negative impacts to society. Copyright claims and Author identification are deemed crucial as there has been a considerable amount of increase in content violation owing to the lack of proper ethics in society. The Author's attribution in both English and Romanized Sinhala became a major requirement in the last few decades. As an area largely unexplored, particularly within the context of Romanized Sinhala, the research contributes significantly to the field of computational linguistics. The proposed author attribution system offers a unique approach, allowing for the comparison of only two sets of text: suspect author and anonymous text, a departure from traditional methodologies which often rely on larger corpora. This work focuses on using the numerical representation of various pairs of the same and different authors allowing for, the model to train on these representations as opposed to text, this allows for it to apply to a multitude of authors and contexts, given that the suspected author text, and the anonymous text are of reasonable quality. By expanding the scope of authorship attribution to encompass diverse linguistic contexts, the work contributes to fostering trust and accountability in digital communication, especially in Sri Lanka. This research presents a pioneering approach to author attribution in both English and Romanized Sinhala, addressing a critical need for content verification and intellectual property rights enforcement in the digital age.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hrithik Majumdar Shibu, Shrestha Datta, Md. Sumon Miah, Nasrullah Sami, Mahruba Sharmin Chowdhury, Md. Saiful Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news presents a significant global challenge, particularly in low-resource languages like Bangla, which lack adequate datasets and detection tools. Although manual fact-checking is accurate, it is expensive and slow to prevent the dissemination of fake news. Addressing this gap, we introduce BanFakeNews-2.0, a robust dataset to enhance Bangla fake news detection. This version includes 11,700 additional, meticulously curated fake news articles validated from credible sources, creating a proportional dataset of 47,000 authentic and 13,000 fake news items across 13 categories. In addition, we created a manually curated independent test set of 460 fake and 540 authentic news items for rigorous evaluation. We invest efforts in collecting fake news from credible sources and manually verified while preserving the linguistic richness. We develop a benchmark system utilizing transformer-based architectures, including fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers variants (F1-87\%) and Large Language Models with Quantized Low-Rank Approximation (F1-89\%), that significantly outperforms traditional methods. BanFakeNews-2.0 offers a valuable resource to advance research and application in fake news detection for low-resourced languages. We publicly release our dataset and model on Github to foster research in this direction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the e-Llama models: 8 billion and 70 billion parameter large language models that are adapted towards the e-commerce domain. These models are meant as foundation models with deep knowledge about e-commerce, that form a base for instruction- and fine-tuning. The e-Llama models are obtained by continuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of domain-specific data.
  We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a series of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted to the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual, e-commerce specific evaluation tasks.
  We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1 models can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant performance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging the adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance trade-off between domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihed Ncib</p>
<p>Abstract: This study conducts a systematic assessment of the capabilities of 12 machine learning models and model variations in detecting economic ideology. As an evaluation benchmark, I use manifesto data spanning six elections in the United Kingdom and pre-annotated by expert and crowd coders. The analysis assesses the performance of several generative, fine-tuned, and zero-shot models at the granular and aggregate levels. The results show that generative models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash consistently outperform other models against all benchmarks. However, they pose issues of accessibility and resource availability. Fine-tuning yielded competitive performance and offers a reliable alternative through domain-specific optimization. But its dependency on training data severely limits scalability. Zero-shot models consistently face difficulties with identifying signals of economic ideology, often resulting in negative associations with human coding. Using general knowledge for the domain-specific task of ideology scaling proved to be unreliable. Other key findings include considerable within-party variation, fine-tuning benefiting from larger training data, and zero-shot's sensitivity to prompt content. The assessments include the strengths and limitations of each model and derive best-practices for automated analyses of political content.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the increased use of the internet and social networks for online discussions, the spread of toxic and inappropriate content on social networking sites has also increased. Several studies have been conducted in different languages. However, there is less work done for South Asian languages for inappropriate content identification using deep learning techniques. In Urdu language, the spellings are not unique, and people write different common spellings for the same word, while mixing it other languages, like English in the text makes it more challenging, and limited research work is available to process such language with the finest algorithms. The use of attention layer with a deep learning model can help handling the long-term dependencies and increase its efficiency . To explore the effects of the attention layer, this study proposes attention-based Bidirectional GRU hybrid model for identifying inappropriate content in Urdu Unicode text language. Four different baseline deep learning models; LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, and TCN, are used to compare the performance of the proposed model. The results of these models were compared based on evaluation metrics, dataset size, and impact of the word embedding layer. The pre-trained Urdu word2Vec embeddings were utilized for our case. Our proposed model BiGRU-A outperformed all other baseline models by yielding 84\% accuracy without using pre-trained word2Vec layer. From our experiments, we have established that the attention layer improves the model's efficiency, and pre-trained word2Vec embedding does not work well with an inappropriate content dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on general-purpose text embedding tasks. While dense embeddings have dominated related research, we introduce the first Lexicon-based EmbeddiNgS (LENS) leveraging LLMs that achieve competitive performance on these tasks. Regarding the inherent tokenization redundancy issue and unidirectional attention limitations in traditional causal LLMs, LENS consolidates the vocabulary space through token embedding clustering, and investigates bidirectional attention and various pooling strategies. Specifically, LENS simplifies lexicon matching by assigning each dimension to a specific token cluster, where semantically similar tokens are grouped together, and unlocking the full potential of LLMs through bidirectional attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LENS outperforms dense embeddings on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), delivering compact feature representations that match the sizes of dense counterparts. Notably, combining LENSE with dense embeddings achieves state-of-the-art performance on the retrieval subset of MTEB (i.e. BEIR).</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, utility, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, repetitive, and unoriginal outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they progressively deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning, which is regarded as one challenging task to pursue advanced visual scene comprehension, has been used to diagnose the reasoning ability of AI systems. However, reliable reasoning requires a good grasp of the scene's details. Existing work fails to effectively exploit the real-world object relationship information present within the scene, and instead overly relies on knowledge from training memory. Based on these observations, we propose a novel scene-graph-enhanced visual commonsense reasoning generation method named \textit{\textbf{G2}}, which first utilizes the image patches and LLMs to construct a location-free scene graph, and then answer and explain based on the scene graph's information. We also propose automatic scene graph filtering and selection strategies to absorb valuable scene graph information during training. Extensive experiments are conducted on the tasks and datasets of scene graph constructing and visual commonsense answering and explaining, respectively. Experimental results and ablation analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical images and reports offer invaluable insights into patient health. The heterogeneity and complexity of these data hinder effective analysis. To bridge this gap, we investigate contrastive learning models for cross-domain retrieval, which associates medical images with their corresponding clinical reports. This study benchmarks the robustness of four state-of-the-art contrastive learning models: CLIP, CXR-RePaiR, MedCLIP, and CXR-CLIP. We introduce an occlusion retrieval task to evaluate model performance under varying levels of image corruption. Our findings reveal that all evaluated models are highly sensitive to out-of-distribution data, as evidenced by the proportional decrease in performance with increasing occlusion levels. While MedCLIP exhibits slightly more robustness, its overall performance remains significantly behind CXR-CLIP and CXR-RePaiR. CLIP, trained on a general-purpose dataset, struggles with medical image-report retrieval, highlighting the importance of domain-specific training data. The evaluation of this work suggests that more effort needs to be spent on improving the robustness of these models. By addressing these limitations, we can develop more reliable cross-domain retrieval models for medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditi Singh, Abul Ehtesham, Saket Kumar, Tala Talaei Khoei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by integrating real time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite its promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management.
  Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding autonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflection, planning, tool use, and multiagent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows to meet complex task requirements. This integration enables Agentic RAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context awareness across diverse applications.
  This survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agentic RAG, beginning with its foundational principles and the evolution of RAG paradigms. It presents a detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG architectures, highlights key applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, and examines practical implementation strategies. Additionally, it addresses challenges in scaling these systems, ensuring ethical decision making, and optimizing performance for real-world applications, while providing detailed insights into frameworks and tools for implementing Agentic RAG</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Ruiz, Tania Ram\'irez, Daniela Moctezuma</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning has become an essential Vision & Language research task. It is about predicting the most accurate caption given a specific image or video. The research community has achieved impressive results by continuously proposing new models and approaches to improve the overall model's performance. Nevertheless, despite increasing proposals, the performance metrics used to measure their advances have remained practically untouched through the years. A probe of that, nowadays metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE are still very used, aside from more sophisticated metrics such as BertScore and ClipScore.
  Hence, it is essential to adjust how are measure the advances, limitations, and scopes of the new image captioning proposals, as well as to adapt new metrics to these new advanced image captioning approaches.
  This work proposes a new evaluation metric for the image captioning problem. To do that, first, it was generated a human-labeled dataset to assess to which degree the captions correlate with the image's content. Taking these human scores as ground truth, we propose a new metric, and compare it with several well-known metrics, from classical to newer ones. Outperformed results were also found, and interesting insights were presented and discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harrison Fuller, Fernando Gabriela Garcia, Victor Flores</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning in medical image classification presents a significant challenge due to the limited availability of annotated data and the complex nature of medical imagery. In this work, we propose Adaptive Vision-Language Fine-tuning with Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment (HiCA), a novel framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for medical image analysis. HiCA introduces a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, combining domain-specific pretraining and hierarchical contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations at multiple levels. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, Chest X-ray and Breast Ultrasound, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. Further analyses demonstrate the robustness, generalizability, and interpretability of our method, with substantial improvements in performance compared to existing baselines. Our work highlights the potential of hierarchical contrastive strategies in adapting LVLMs to the unique challenges of medical imaging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nur Shazwani Kamarudin, Mokhairi Makhtar, Syadiah Nor Wan Shamsuddin, Syed Abdullah Fadzli</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays, more and more images are available. Annotation and retrieval of the images pose classification problems, where each class is defined as the group of database images labelled with a common semantic label. Various systems have been proposed for content-based retrieval, as well as for image classification and indexing. In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been proposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-category image classification. A well known pre-processing and post-processing method was used and applied to three problems; image segmentation, object identification and image classification. The method was applied to classify single object images from Amazon and Google datasets. The classification was tested for four different classifiers; BayesNetwork (BN), Random Forest (RF), Bagging and Vote. The estimated classification accuracies ranged from 20% to 99% (using 10-fold cross validation). The Bagging classifier presents the best performance, followed by the Random Forest classifier.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumail Alhamoud, Shaden Alshammari, Yonglong Tian, Guohao Li, Philip Torr, Yoon Kim, Marzyeh Ghassemi</p>
<p>Abstract: Many practical vision-language applications require models that understand negation, e.g., when using natural language to retrieve images which contain certain objects but not others. Despite advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) through large-scale training, their ability to comprehend negation remains underexplored. This study addresses the question: how well do current VLMs understand negation? We introduce NegBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate negation understanding across 18 task variations and 79k examples spanning image, video, and medical datasets. The benchmark consists of two core tasks designed to evaluate negation understanding in diverse multimodal settings: Retrieval with Negation and Multiple Choice Questions with Negated Captions. Our evaluation reveals that modern VLMs struggle significantly with negation, often performing at chance level. To address these shortcomings, we explore a data-centric approach wherein we finetune CLIP models on large-scale synthetic datasets containing millions of negated captions. We show that this approach can result in a 10% increase in recall on negated queries and a 40% boost in accuracy on multiple-choice questions with negated captions.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) present significant potential for supporting numerous real-world applications and delivering positive social impacts, they still face significant challenges in terms of the inherent risk of privacy leakage, hallucinated outputs, and value misalignment, and can be maliciously used for generating toxic content and unethical purposes after been jailbroken. Therefore, in this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent advancements aimed at mitigating these issues, organized across the four phases of LLM development and usage: data collecting and pre-training, fine-tuning and alignment, prompting and reasoning, and post-processing and auditing. We elaborate on the recent advances for enhancing the performance of LLMs in terms of privacy protection, hallucination reduction, value alignment, toxicity elimination, and jailbreak defenses. In contrast to previous surveys that focus on a single dimension of responsible LLMs, this survey presents a unified framework that encompasses these diverse dimensions, providing a comprehensive view of enhancing LLMs to better serve real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a method for augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a combination of text and visual data to enable accurate question answering in visualization of scientific data, making conversational visualization possible. LLMs struggle with tasks like visual data interaction, as they lack contextual visual information. We address this problem by merging a text description of a visualization and dataset with snapshots of the visualization. We extract their essential features into a structured text file, highly compact, yet descriptive enough to appropriately augment the LLM with contextual information, without any fine-tuning. This approach can be applied to any visualization that is already finally rendered, as long as it is associated with some textual description.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleg Somov, Elena Tutubalina</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables users to interact with databases through natural language, simplifying the retrieval and synthesis of information. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in converting natural language questions into SQL queries, their broader adoption is limited by two main challenges: achieving robust generalization across diverse queries and ensuring interpretative confidence in their predictions. To tackle these issues, our research investigates the integration of selective classifiers into Text-to-SQL systems. We analyse the trade-off between coverage and risk using entropy based confidence estimation with selective classifiers and assess its impact on the overall performance of Text-to-SQL models. Additionally, we explore the models' initial calibration and improve it with calibration techniques for better model alignment between confidence and accuracy. Our experimental results show that encoder-decoder T5 is better calibrated than in-context-learning GPT 4 and decoder-only Llama 3, thus the designated external entropy-based selective classifier has better performance. The study also reveal that, in terms of error detection, selective classifier with a higher probability detects errors associated with irrelevant questions rather than incorrect query generations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Kirmayr, Lukas Stappen, Phillip Schneider, Florian Matthes, Elisabeth Andr\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's assistant landscape, personalisation enhances interactions, fosters long-term relationships, and deepens engagement. However, many systems struggle with retaining user preferences, leading to repetitive user requests and disengagement. Furthermore, the unregulated and opaque extraction of user preferences in industry applications raises significant concerns about privacy and trust, especially in regions with stringent regulations like Europe. In response to these challenges, we propose a long-term memory system for voice assistants, structured around predefined categories. This approach leverages Large Language Models to efficiently extract, store, and retrieve preferences within these categories, ensuring both personalisation and transparency. We also introduce a synthetic multi-turn, multi-session conversation dataset (CarMem), grounded in real industry data, tailored to an in-car voice assistant setting. Benchmarked on the dataset, our system achieves an F1-score of .78 to .95 in preference extraction, depending on category granularity. Our maintenance strategy reduces redundant preferences by 95% and contradictory ones by 92%, while the accuracy of optimal retrieval is at .87. Collectively, the results demonstrate the system's suitability for industrial applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning. The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of "thought" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to "think" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bihui Jin, Jiayue Wang, Pengyu Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning developers frequently use interactive computational notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks, to host code for data processing and model training. Jupyter notebooks provide a convenient tool for writing machine learning pipelines and interactively observing outputs, however, maintaining Jupyter notebooks, e.g., to add new features or fix bugs, can be challenging due to the length and complexity of the notebooks. Moreover, there is no existing benchmark related to developer edits on Jupyter notebooks. To address this, we present the first dataset of 48,398 Jupyter notebook edits derived from 20,095 revisions of 792 machine learning repositories on GitHub, and perform the first study of the using LLMs to predict code edits in Jupyter notebooks. Our dataset captures granular details of cell-level and line-level modifications, offering a foundation for understanding real-world maintenance patterns in machine learning workflows. We observed that the edits on Jupyter notebooks are highly localized, with changes averaging only 166 lines of code in repositories. While larger models outperform smaller counterparts in code editing, all models have low accuracy on our dataset even after finetuning, demonstrating the complexity of real-world machine learning maintenance tasks. Our findings emphasize the critical role of contextual information in improving model performance and point toward promising avenues for advancing large language models' capabilities in engineering machine learning code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlong He, Pengfei Li, Gang Liu, Genrong He, Zhaolin Chen, Shenjun Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent an evolutionary expansion in the capabilities of traditional large language models, enabling them to tackle challenges that surpass the scope of purely text-based applications. It leverages the knowledge previously encoded within these language models, thereby enhancing their applicability and functionality in the reign of multimodal contexts. Recent works investigate the adaptation of MLLMs as a universal solution to address medical multi-modal problems as a generative task. In this paper, we propose a parameter efficient framework for fine-tuning MLLMs, specifically validated on medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) and medical report generation (MRG) tasks, using public benchmark datasets. We also introduce an evaluation metric using the 5-point Likert scale and its weighted average value to measure the quality of the generated reports for MRG tasks, where the scale ratings are labelled by both humans manually and the GPT-4 model. We further assess the consistency of performance metrics across traditional measures, GPT-4, and human ratings for both VQA and MRG tasks. The results indicate that semantic similarity assessments using GPT-4 align closely with human annotators and provide greater stability, yet they reveal a discrepancy when compared to conventional lexical similarity measurements. This questions the reliability of lexical similarity metrics for evaluating the performance of generative models in Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Besides, our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms GPT-4v. This indicates that without additional fine-tuning, multi-modal models like GPT-4v do not perform effectively on medical imaging tasks.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often lack culture-specific knowledge of daily life, especially across diverse regions and non-English languages. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' cultural sensitivities are limited to a single language or collected from online sources such as Wikipedia, which do not reflect the mundane everyday lifestyles of diverse regions. That is, information about the food people eat for their birthday celebrations, spices they typically use, musical instruments youngsters play, or the sports they practice in school is common cultural knowledge but uncommon in easily collected online sources, especially for underrepresented cultures. To address this issue, we introduce BLEnD, a hand-crafted benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' everyday knowledge across diverse cultures and languages. BLEnD comprises 52.6k question-answer pairs from 16 countries/regions, in 13 different languages, including low-resource ones such as Amharic, Assamese, Azerbaijani, Hausa, and Sundanese. We construct the benchmark to include two formats of questions: short-answer and multiple-choice. We show that LLMs perform better for cultures that are highly represented online, with a maximum 57.34% difference in GPT-4, the best-performing model, in the short-answer format. For cultures represented by mid-to-high-resource languages, LLMs perform better in their local languages, but for cultures represented by low-resource languages, LLMs perform better in English than the local languages. We make our dataset publicly available at: https://github.com/nlee0212/BLEnD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Ao, Yuancheng Wang, Xiaohai Tian, Dekun Chen, Jun Zhang, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang, Haizhou Li, Zhizheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech encompasses a wealth of information, including but not limited to content, paralinguistic, and environmental information. This comprehensive nature of speech significantly impacts communication and is crucial for human-computer interaction. Chat-Oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their general-purpose assistance capabilities, have evolved to handle multi-modal inputs, including speech. Although these models can be adept at recognizing and analyzing speech, they often fall short of generating appropriate responses. We argue that this is due to the lack of principles on task definition and model development, which requires open-source datasets and metrics suitable for model evaluation. To bridge the gap, we present SD-Eval, a benchmark dataset aimed at multidimensional evaluation of spoken dialogue understanding and generation. SD-Eval focuses on paralinguistic and environmental information and includes 7,303 utterances, amounting to 8.76 hours of speech data. The data is aggregated from eight public datasets, representing four perspectives: emotion, accent, age, and background sound. To assess the SD-Eval benchmark dataset, we implement three different models and construct a training set following a process similar to that of SD-Eval. The training set contains 1,052.72 hours of speech data and 724.4k utterances. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation using objective evaluation methods (e.g. BLEU and ROUGE), subjective evaluations and LLM-based metrics for the generated responses. Models conditioned with paralinguistic and environmental information outperform their counterparts in both objective and subjective measures. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that LLM-based metrics show a higher correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics. We open-source SD-Eval at https://github.com/amphionspace/SD-Eval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yin, Chengkai Liu, Ali Mostafavi, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of crisis/disaster informatics, social media is increasingly being used for improving situational awareness to inform response and relief efforts. Efficient and accurate text classification tools have been a focal area of investigation in crisis informatics. However, current methods mostly rely on single-label text classification models, which fails to capture different insights embedded in dynamic and multifaceted disaster-related social media data. This study introduces a novel approach to disaster text classification by enhancing a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) through instruction fine-tuning targeted for multi-label classification of disaster-related tweets. Our methodology involves creating a comprehensive instruction dataset from disaster-related tweets, which is then used to fine-tune an open-source LLM, thereby embedding it with disaster-specific knowledge. This fine-tuned model can classify multiple aspects of disaster-related information simultaneously, such as the type of event, informativeness, and involvement of human aid, significantly improving the utility of social media data for situational awareness in disasters. The results demonstrate that this approach enhances the categorization of critical information from social media posts, thereby facilitating a more effective deployment for situational awareness during emergencies. This research paves the way for more advanced, adaptable, and robust disaster management tools, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to improve real-time situational awareness and response strategies in disaster scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability to comprehend instructions and generate human-like text, enabling sophisticated agent simulation beyond basic behavior replication. However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved the generation of fluent and convincing text, raising concerns about their potential misuse on social media platforms. We present a comprehensive methodology for creating nine Twitter datasets to examine the generative capabilities of four prominent LLMs: Llama 3, Mistral, Qwen2, and GPT4o. These datasets encompass four censored and five uncensored model configurations, including 7B and 8B parameter base-instruction models of the three open-source LLMs. Additionally, we perform a data quality analysis to assess the characteristics of textual outputs from human, "censored," and "uncensored" models, employing semantic meaning, lexical richness, structural patterns, content characteristics, and detector performance metrics to identify differences and similarities. Our evaluation demonstrates that "uncensored" models significantly undermine the effectiveness of automated detection methods. This study addresses a critical gap by exploring smaller open-source models and the ramifications of "uncensoring," providing valuable insights into how domain adaptation and content moderation strategies influence both the detectability and structural characteristics of machine-generated text.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a standard architectural pattern for incorporating domain-specific knowledge into user-facing chat applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG systems are characterized by (1) a document retriever that queries a domain-specific corpus for context information relevant to an input query, and (2) an LLM that generates a response based on the provided query and context. However, comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems remains a challenge due to the lack of unified evaluation criteria and annotated datasets. In response, we introduce RAGBench: the first comprehensive, large-scale RAG benchmark dataset of 100k examples. It covers five unique industry-specific domains and various RAG task types. RAGBench examples are sourced from industry corpora such as user manuals, making it particularly relevant for industry applications. Further, we formalize the TRACe evaluation framework: a set of explainable and actionable RAG evaluation metrics applicable across all RAG domains. We release the labeled dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rungalileo/ragbench. RAGBench explainable labels facilitate holistic evaluation of RAG systems, enabling actionable feedback for continuous improvement of production applications. Thorough extensive benchmarking, we find that LLM-based RAG evaluation methods struggle to compete with a finetuned RoBERTa model on the RAG evaluation task. We identify areas where existing approaches fall short and propose the adoption of RAGBench with TRACe towards advancing the state of RAG evaluation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Erak, Nouf Alabbasi, Omar Alhussein, Ismail Lotfi, Amr Hussein, Sami Muhaidat, Merouane Debbah</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with technical standards in telecommunications. We propose a fine-tuned retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM) to serve as an oracle for communication networks. Our developed system leverages forward-looking semantic chunking to adaptively determine parsing breakpoints based on embedding similarity, enabling effective processing of diverse document formats. To handle the challenge of multiple similar contexts in technical standards, we employ a re-ranking algorithm to prioritize the most relevant retrieved chunks. Recognizing the limitations of Phi-2's small context window, we implement a recent technique, namely SelfExtend, to expand the context window during inference, which not only boosts the performance but also can accommodate a wider range of user queries and design requirements from customers to specialized technicians. For fine-tuning, we utilize the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique to enhance computational efficiency during training and enable effective fine-tuning on small datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over existing question-answering approaches in the telecom domain, achieving performance that exceeds larger language models such as GPT-4 (which is about 880 times larger in size). This work presents a novel approach to leveraging SLMs for communication networks, offering a balance of efficiency and performance. This work can serve as a foundation towards agentic language models for networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects. Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench. The dataset and code are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/AudioBERT}.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for medical question answering, there is limited work focused on tropical and infectious disease-specific exploration. We build on an opensource tropical and infectious diseases (TRINDs) dataset, expanding it to include demographic and semantic clinical and consumer augmentations yielding 11000+ prompts. We evaluate LLM performance on these, comparing generalist and medical LLMs, as well as LLM outcomes to human experts. We demonstrate through systematic experimentation, the benefit of contextual information such as demographics, location, gender, risk factors for optimal LLM response. Finally we develop a prototype of TRINDs-LM, a research tool that provides a playground to navigate how context impacts LLM outputs for health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Jiang, Jia Li, He Zong, Huanyu Liu, Hao Zhu, Shukai Hu, Erlu Li, Jiazheng Ding, Yu Han, Wei Ning, Gen Wang, Yihong Dong, Kechi Zhang, Ge Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in code completion, and researchers are focusing on scaling up LLMs to improve their accuracy. However, larger LLMs have lower inference efficiency, affecting developers' experience and productivity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and effective LLM for code completion named aiXcoder-7B. Compared to existing LLMs, aiXcoder-7B achieves higher code completion accuracy while having smaller scales (i.e., 7 billion parameters). We attribute the superiority of aiXcoder-7B to three key factors: (1) Multi-objective training. We employ three training objectives, one of which is our proposed Structured Fill-In-the-Middle (SFIM). SFIM considers the syntax structures in code and effectively improves the performance of LLMs for code. (2) Diverse data sampling strategies. They consider inter-file relationships and enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding cross-file contexts. (3) Extensive high-quality data. We establish a rigorous data collection pipeline and consume a total of 1.2 trillion unique tokens for training aiXcoder-7B. This vast volume of data enables aiXcoder-7B to learn a broad distribution of code. We evaluate aiXcoder-7B in five popular code completion benchmarks and a new benchmark collected by this paper. The results show that aiXcoder-7B outperforms the latest six LLMs with similar sizes and even surpasses four larger LLMs (e.g., StarCoder2-15B and CodeLlama-34B), positioning aiXcoder-7B as a lightweight and effective LLM for academia and industry. Finally, we summarize three valuable insights for helping practitioners train the next generations of LLMs for code. aiXcoder-7B has been open-souced and gained significant attention. Until January 2025, aiXcoder-7B has received 2,226 GitHub Stars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. However, the invisible reasoning process leaves us a doubt that, can implicit CoT really be equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is either trained or prompted to perform implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that when prompted, LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. But when trained, they indeed calculate intermediate steps. Moreover, in both situations, we find the effect of using implicit CoT is susceptible to the format of the problem, reaffirming the current deficiency of implicit CoT.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07678">Can linguists better understand DNA?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multilingual transfer ability, which reflects how well models fine-tuned on one source language can be applied to other languages, has been well studied in multilingual pre-trained models. However, the existence of such capability transfer between natural language and gene sequences/languages remains under explored.This study addresses this gap by drawing inspiration from the sentence-pair classification task used for evaluating sentence similarity in natural language. We constructed two analogous tasks: DNA-pair classification(DNA sequence similarity) and DNA-protein-pair classification(gene coding determination). These tasks were designed to validate the transferability of capabilities from natural language to gene sequences. Even a small-scale pre-trained model like GPT-2-small, which was pre-trained on English, achieved an accuracy of 78% on the DNA-pair classification task after being fine-tuned on English sentence-pair classification data(XTREME PAWS-X). While training a BERT model on multilingual text, the precision reached 89%. On the more complex DNA-protein-pair classification task, however, the model's output was barely distinguishable from random output.Experimental validation has confirmed that the transfer of capabilities from natural language to biological language is unequivocally present. Building on this foundation, we have also investigated the impact of model parameter scale and pre-training on this capability transfer. We provide recommendations for facilitating the transfer of capabilities from natural language to genetic language,as well as new approaches for conducting biological research based on this capability.This study offers an intriguing new perspective on exploring the relationship between natural language and genetic language.</p>

Furthermore, we investigate the impact of punctuation removal on model performance and neural alignment, revealing that BERT's accuracy enhances in the absence of punctuation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tushar Aggarwal, Aarohi Bhand</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's fast-paced world, effective presentations have become an essential tool for communication in both online and offline meetings. The crafting of a compelling presentation requires significant time and effort, from gathering key insights to designing slides that convey information clearly and concisely. However, despite the wealth of resources available, people often find themselves manually extracting crucial points, analyzing data, and organizing content in a way that ensures clarity and impact. Furthermore, a successful presentation goes beyond just the slides; it demands rehearsal and the ability to weave a captivating narrative to fully engage the audience. Although there has been some exploration of automating document-to-slide generation, existing research is largely centered on converting research papers. In addition, automation of the delivery of these presentations has yet to be addressed. We introduce PASS, a pipeline used to generate slides from general Word documents, going beyond just research papers, which also automates the oral delivery of the generated slides. PASS analyzes user documents to create a dynamic, engaging presentation with an AI-generated voice. Additionally, we developed an LLM-based evaluation metric to assess our pipeline across three critical dimensions of presentations: relevance, coherence, and redundancy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Chen, Pushkar Mishra, Luca Franceschi, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel</p>
<p>Abstract: Factorisation-based Models (FMs), such as DistMult, have enjoyed enduring success for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks, often outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data is growing rapidly in volume and complexity. Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component is examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly available. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingyang Wu, Ying Xu, Tingsong Xiao, Yunze Xiao, Yitong Li, Tianyang Wang, Yichi Zhang, Shanghai Zhong, Yuwei Zhang, Wei Lu, Yifan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potent tools for advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the attitudinal disparities between LLMs and humans towards these goals can pose significant challenges. This study conducts a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature on the attitudes of LLMs towards the 17 SDGs, emphasizing the comparison between their attitudes and support for each goal and those of humans. We examine the potential disparities, primarily focusing on aspects such as understanding and emotions, cultural and regional differences, task objective variations, and factors considered in the decision-making process. These disparities arise from the underrepresentation and imbalance in LLM training data, historical biases, quality issues, lack of contextual understanding, and skewed ethical values reflected. The study also investigates the risks and harms that may arise from neglecting the attitudes of LLMs towards the SDGs, including the exacerbation of social inequalities, racial discrimination, environmental destruction, and resource wastage. To address these challenges, we propose strategies and recommendations to guide and regulate the application of LLMs, ensuring their alignment with the principles and goals of the SDGs, and therefore creating a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom A. Lamb, Adam Davies, Alasdair Paren, Philip H. S. Torr, Francesco Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs) to perform arbitrary user-specified tasks, these models often still leverage spurious or biased features learned from their training data, leading to undesired behaviours when deploying them in new contexts. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have sparked growing interest in developing LM agents. While fully autonomous agents could excel in many scenarios, numerous use cases inherently require them to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we present Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), a general framework enabling asynchronous, tripartite interaction among agents, humans, and task environments. We instantiate Co-Gym with three representative tasks in both simulated and real-world conditions, and propose an evaluation framework that assesses both the collaboration outcomes and processes. Our findings reveal that collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance within those delivered cases, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. However, our study also highlights significant challenges in developing collaborative agents, requiring advancements in core aspects of intelligence -- communication capabilities, situational awareness, and balancing autonomy and human control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in short text clustering, yet it has an inherent drawback of mistakenly identifying samples from the same category as negatives and then separating them in the feature space (false negative separation), which hinders the generation of superior representations. To generate more discriminative representations for efficient clustering, we propose a novel short text clustering method, called Discriminative Representation learning via \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{AECL}). The \textbf{AECL} consists of two modules which are the pseudo-label generation module and the contrastive learning module. Both modules build a sample-level attention mechanism to capture similarity relationships between samples and aggregate cross-sample features to generate consistent representations. Then, the former module uses the more discriminative consistent representation to produce reliable supervision information for assist clustering, while the latter module explores similarity relationships and consistent representations optimize the construction of positive samples to perform similarity-guided contrastive learning, effectively addressing the false negative separation issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \textbf{AECL} outperforms state-of-the-art methods. If the paper is accepted, we will open-source the code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghav Singhal, Zachary Horvitz, Ryan Teehan, Mengye Ren, Zhou Yu, Kathleen McKeown, Rajesh Ranganath</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.
