<p><b>Authors:</b> Joyjit Roy, Samaresh Kumar Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingfeng Li, Yunlong Lu, Yuefei Zhang, Jingyu Yao, Yixin Zhu, KeYuan Cheng, Yongyi Wang, Qirui Zheng, Xionghui Yang, Wenxin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive environments requiring strategic decision-making, yet systematic evaluation of these capabilities remains challenging. Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13215">When to Think Fast and Slow? AMOR: Entropy-Based Metacognitive Gate for Dynamic SSM-Attention Switching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers allocate uniform computation to every position, regardless of difficulty. State Space Models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives but struggle with precise information retrieval over a long horizon. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition (Kahneman, 2011), we propose AMOR (Adaptive Metacognitive Output Router), a hybrid architecture that dynamically engages sparse attention only when an SSM backbone is "uncertain"--as measured by prediction entropy. Compared to standard transformers, AMOR gains efficiency by projecting keys and values from SSM hidden states (Ghost KV), reusing the SSM's O(n) computation rather than requiring O(n^2) attention at every layer. On small-scale synthetic retrieval tasks, AMOR outperforms both SSM-only and transformer-only baselines, achieving perfect retrieval accuracy while engaging attention on only 22% of positions. We validate that prediction entropy reliably signals retrieval need, with a gap of 1.09 nats (nearly half the entropy range) between retrieval and local positions. Additionally, our approach provides interpretable adaptive computation, where routing decisions can be understood in information-theoretic terms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zerui Cheng, Jiashuo Liu, Chunjie Wu, Jianzhu Yao, Pramod Viswanath, Ge Zhang, Wenhao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The main issue with most evaluation schemes today is their "static" nature: the same problems are reused repeatedly, allowing for memorization, format exploitation, and eventual saturation. To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.
  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.
  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity. To stimulate future research, we have open-sourced all code and datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13218">Scaling the Scaling Logic: Agentic Meta-Synthesis of Logic Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Liu, Zhi Wu, Runquan Xie, Zhanhui Kang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains over the seed baseline at matched training steps, improving SynLogic by +5.2, BBEH by +1.4, AIME25 by +3.0, and Brumo25 by +3.7.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13224">A Geometric Taxonomy of Hallucinations in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Mar\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: The term "hallucination" in large language models conflates distinct phenomena with different geometric signatures in embedding space. We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13226">Variation is the Key: A Variation-Based Framework for LLM-Generated Text Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuecong Li, Xiaohong Li, Qiang Hu, Yao Zhang, Junjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial but challenging. Existing detectors depend on impractical assumptions, such as white-box settings, or solely rely on text-level features, leading to imprecise detection ability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective and practical LLM-generated text detection method, VaryBalance. The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13230">Intelligence as Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Truong Xuan Khanh, Truong Quynh Hoa</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, many systems exhibit stagnation in long-horizon adaptability despite continued performance optimization. This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13232">PlotChain: Deterministic Checkpointed Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Engineering Plot Reading</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayank Ravishankara</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PlotChain, a deterministic, generator-based benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on engineering plot reading-recovering quantitative values from classic plots (e.g., Bode/FFT, step response, stress-strain, pump curves) rather than OCR-only extraction or free-form captioning. PlotChain contains 15 plot families with 450 rendered plots (30 per family), where every item is produced from known parameters and paired with exact ground truth computed directly from the generating process. A central contribution is checkpoint-based diagnostic evaluation: in addition to final targets, each item includes intermediate 'cp_' fields that isolate sub-skills (e.g., reading cutoff frequency or peak magnitude) and enable failure localization within a plot family. We evaluate four state-of-the-art MLLMs under a standardized, deterministic protocol (temperature = 0 and a strict JSON-only numeric output schema) and score predictions using per-field tolerances designed to reflect human plot-reading precision. Under the 'plotread' tolerance policy, the top models achieve 80.42% (Gemini 2.5 Pro), 79.84% (GPT-4.1), and 78.21% (Claude Sonnet 4.5) overall field-level pass rates, while GPT-4o trails at 61.59%. Despite strong performance on many families, frequency-domain tasks remain brittle: bandpass response stays low (<= 23%), and FFT spectrum remains challenging. We release the generator, dataset, raw model outputs, scoring code, and manifests with checksums to support fully reproducible runs and retrospective rescoring under alternative tolerance policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Liao, Yichen Wan, shuchen wu, Chenxi Miao, Xin Shen, Weikang Li, Yang Li, Deguo Xia, Jizhou Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based role-playing has rapidly improved in fidelity, yet stronger adherence to persona constraints commonly increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, especially for risky or negative personas. Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Xiong, Chunyi Peng, Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Zulong Chen, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by incorporating external visual documents to address a given query. Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rizky Ramadhana Putra, Raihan Sultan Pasha Basuki, Yutong Cheng, Peng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated reasoning is critical in domains such as law and governance, where verifying claims against facts in documents requires both accuracy and interpretability. Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roham Koohestani, Ali Al-Kaswan, Jonathan Katzy, Maliheh Izadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models are frequently trained on massive datasets containing restrictively licensed source code. This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Y. Zadeh, Xiaomeng Li, Andry Rakotonirainy, Ronald Schroeter, Sebastien Glaser, Zishuo Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language explanations play a critical role in establishing trust and acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), yet existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for analysing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales across diverse scenarios. This paper introduces X-Blocks (eXplanation Blocks), a hierarchical analytical framework that identifies the linguistic building blocks of natural language explanations for AVs at three levels: context, syntax, and lexicon.
  At the context level, we propose RACE (Reasoning-Aligned Classification of Explanations), a multi-LLM ensemble framework that combines Chain-of-Thought reasoning with self-consistency mechanisms to robustly classify explanations into 32 scenario-aware categories. Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.
  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.
  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Najmul Hasan, Prashanth BusiReddyGari</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/najmulhasan-code/dpbench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Babu Piskala</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Darren Li, Meiqi Chen, Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Frontier language models improve with additional test-time computation, but serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling can be compute-inefficient under fixed inference budgets. We propose SELFCEST, which equips a base model with the ability to spawn same-weight clones in separate parallel contexts by agentic reinforcement learning. Training is end-to-end under a global task reward with shared-parameter rollouts, yielding a learned controller that allocates both generation and context budget across branches. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks and long-context multi-hop QA, SELFCEST improves the accuracy-cost Pareto frontier relative to monolithic baselines at matched inference budget, and exhibits out-of-distribution generalization in both domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber-threats demand intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are not only accurate but also interpretable. This paper presented a novel IDS framework that integrated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency in deep learning models. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP. We also conducted a trust-focused expert survey based on IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits via an interactive UI to evaluate the system's reliability and usability. This work highlighted the potential of combining performance and transparency in cybersecurity solutions and recommends future enhancements through adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muyan Weng, Defu Cao, Wei Yang, Yashaswi Sharma, Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is unclear whether strong forecasting performance reflects genuine temporal understanding or the ability to reason under contextual and event-driven conditions. We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks. The TemporalBench dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TemporalBench, and we additionally provide a public leaderboard at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Melady/TemporalBench_Leaderboard.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt design significantly impacts the moral competence and safety alignment of large language models (LLMs), yet empirical comparisons remain fragmented across datasets and models.We introduce ProMoral-Bench, a unified benchmark evaluating 11 prompting paradigms across four LLM families. Using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and our new robustness test, ETHICS-Contrast, we measure performance via our proposed Unified Moral Safety Score (UMSS), a metric balancing accuracy and safety. Our results show that compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex multi-stage reasoning, providing higher UMSS scores and greater robustness at a lower token cost. While multi-turn reasoning proves fragile under perturbations, few-shot exemplars consistently enhance moral stability and jailbreak resistance. ProMoral-Bench establishes a standardized framework for principled, cost-effective prompt engineering.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13275">Artificial Organisations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> William Waites</p>
<p>Abstract: Alignment research focuses on making individual AI systems reliable. Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.
  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.
  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanchen David Wang, Clayton Cohn, Zifan Xu, Siyuan Guo, Gautam Biswas, Meiyi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulating student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving environments holds potential for education research, from training adaptive tutoring systems to stress-testing pedagogical interventions. However, collecting authentic data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the high cost of longitudinal studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path to student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners. We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and "unknown unknowns"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving an accuracy indistinguishable from random guessing (52.8%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaston Besanson, Federico Todeschini</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how people trade off accuracy when using AI-powered tools in professional versus personal contexts for adoption purposes, the determinants of those trade-offs, and how users cope when AI/apps are unavailable. Because modern AI systems (especially generative models) can produce acceptable but non-identical outputs, we define "accuracy" as context-specific reliability: the degree to which an output aligns with the user's intent within a tolerance threshold that depends on stakes and the cost of correction. In an online survey (N=300), among respondents with both accuracy items (N=170), the share requiring high accuracy (top-box) is 24.1% at work vs. 8.8% in personal life (+15.3 pp; z=6.29, p<0.001). The gap remains large under a broader top-two-box definition (67.0% vs. 32.9%) and on the full 1-5 ordinal scale (mean 3.86 vs. 3.08). Heavy app use and experience patterns correlate with stricter work standards (H2). When tools are unavailable (H3), respondents report more disruption in personal routines than at work (34.1% vs. 15.3%, p<0.01). We keep the main text focused on these substantive results and place test taxonomy and power derivations in a technical appendix.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ethics review is a foundational mechanism of modern research governance, yet contemporary systems face increasing strain as ethical risks arise as structural consequences of large-scale, interdisciplinary scientific practice. The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daesik Jang, Morgan Lindsay Heisler, Linzi Xing, Yifei Li, Edward Wang, Ying Xiong, Yong Zhang, Zhenan Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically generating and iteratively editing academic slide decks requires more than document summarization. It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisung Shin, Daniel Platnick, Marjan Alirezaie, Hossein Rahnama</p>
<p>Abstract: Perspective-Aware AI requires modeling evolving internal states--goals, emotions, contexts--not merely preferences. Progress is limited by a data bottleneck: digital footprints are privacy-sensitive and perspective states are rarely labeled. We propose Situation Graph Prediction (SGP), a task that frames perspective modeling as an inverse inference problem: reconstructing structured, ontology-aligned representations of perspective from observable multimodal artifacts. To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision. In our study with GPT-4o, we observe a gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference--indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under our controlled setting. Results suggest SGP is non-trivial and provide evidence for the structure-first data synthesis strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flint Xiaofeng Fan, Cheston Tan, Roger Wattenhofer, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, a critical reliability question arises: how do errors propagate across sequential tool calls? We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13321">Detecting Jailbreak Attempts in Clinical Training LLMs Through Automated Linguistic Feature Extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tri Nguyen, Huy Hoang Bao Le, Lohith Srikanth Pentapalli, Laurah Turner, Kelly Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting jailbreak attempts in clinical training large language models (LLMs) requires accurate modeling of linguistic deviations that signal unsafe or off-task user behavior. Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Winikoff</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of autonomous systems to provide explanations is important for supporting transparency and aiding the development of (appropriate) trust. Prior work has defined a mechanism for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to be able to answer questions of the form ``why did you do action $X$?''. However, we know that we ask \emph{contrastive} questions (``why did you do $X$ \emph{instead of} $F$?''). We therefore extend previous work to be able to answer such questions. A computational evaluation shows that using contrastive questions yields a significant reduction in explanation length. A human subject evaluation was conducted to assess whether such contrastive answers are preferred, and how well they support trust development and transparency. We found some evidence for contrastive answers being preferred, and some evidence that they led to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in the system's correctness. We also evaluated the benefit of providing explanations at all. Surprisingly, there was not a clear benefit, and in some situations we found evidence that providing a (full) explanation was worse than not providing any explanation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Nanbeige4.1-3B, a unified generalist language model that simultaneously achieves strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning with only 3B parameters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling, ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses. For code generation, we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning, optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search, we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B. Our results demonstrate that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.</p>

We introduce Morality Chains, a novel formalism for representing moral norms as ordered deontic constraints, and MoralityGym, a benchmark of 98 ethical-dilemma problems presented as trolley-dilemma-style Gymnasium environments. By decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation and introducing a novel Morality Metric, MoralityGym allows the integration of insights from psychology and philosophy into the evaluation of norm-sensitive reasoning. Baseline results with Safe RL methods reveal key limitations, underscoring the need for more principled approaches to ethical decision-making. This work provides a foundation for developing AI systems that behave more reliably, transparently, and ethically in complex real-world contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anhao Zhao, Ziyang Chen, Junlong Tong, Yingqi Fan, Fanghua Ye, Shuhao Li, Yunpu Ma, Wenjie Li, Xiaoyu Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are commonly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore long chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving strong performance at high computational cost. Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoan Wang, Shihao Yang, Jun-En Ding, Hao Zhu, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.</p>

Using the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) intake data for 135,491 meals, we identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes that we then use to condition a generative model and a portion predictor to meet USDA nutritional targets. In comparisons within archetypes, generated meals are better at following recommended daily intake (RDI) targets by 47.0%, while remaining compositionally close to real meals. Our results show that by allowing one to three food substitutions, we were able to create meals that were 10% more nutritious, while reducing costs 19-32%, on average. By turning dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals and simple swaps, this framework can underpin clinical decision support, public-health programs, and consumer apps that deliver scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaechul Roh, Eugene Bagdasarian, Hamed Haddadi, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Shu, Saisri Padmaja Jonnalagedda, Xiang Gao, Bernal Jim\'enez Guti\'errez, Weijian Qi, Kamalika Das, Huan Sun, Yu Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans excel at remembering concrete experiences along spatiotemporal contexts and performing reasoning across those events, i.e., the capacity for episodic memory. In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.</p>

<p>Abstract: To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anooshka Bajaj, Zoran Tiganj</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Gao, Katsumi Inoue, Yongzhi Cao, Hanpin Wang, Feng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Corneli</p>
<p>Abstract: This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Lianjie Cao, Faraz Ahmed, Puneet Sharma, Bingzhe Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic AI require persistent memory to store user-specific histories beyond the limited context window of LLMs. Existing memory systems use dense vector databases or knowledge-graph traversal (or hybrid), incurring high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability. We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henry Han, Xiyang Liu, Xiaodong Wang, Fei Han, Xiaodong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural scaling laws provide a predictable recipe for AI advancement: reducing numerical precision should linearly improve computational efficiency and energy profile (E proportional to bits). In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose DiffusionRollout, a novel selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models, aimed at mitigating error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently validated probabilistic approach to PDE solving, we further explore its ability to quantify predictive uncertainty and demonstrate a strong correlation between prediction errors and standard deviations computed over multiple samples-supporting their use as a proxy for the model's predictive confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linlin Wang, Tianqing Zhu, Laiqiao Qin, Longxiang Gao, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and complex task generation, artificial intelligence systems are transitioning from isolated single-agent architectures to multi-agent systems with collaborative intelligence. However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Wang, Guangda Huzhang, Yuwei Hu, Yu Xia, Shiyin Lu, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Lijun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have substantially driven the progress of autonomous agents for Graphical User Interface (GUI). Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13665">HyFunc: Accelerating LLM-based Function Calls for Agentic AI through Hybrid-Model Cascade and Dynamic Templating</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weibin Liao, Jian-guang Lou, Haoyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: While agentic AI systems rely on LLMs to translate user intent into structured function calls, this process is fraught with computational redundancy, leading to high inference latency that hinders real-time applications. This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single "soft token." This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our "dynamic templating" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to the computational complexity and memory overhead inherent in the self-attention mechanism. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{AllMem}, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that integrates Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks. \textsc{AllMem} enables models to effectively scale to ultra-long contexts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only overcomes the representation constraints typical of linear memory models but also significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint during long-sequence inference. Furthermore, we implement a Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy to replace standard attention layers in pre-trained models with memory-augmented sliding window layers. This framework facilitates the efficient transformation of any off-the-shelf pre-trained LLM into an \textsc{AllMem}-based architecture. Empirical evaluations confirm that our 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with a marginal 0.83 drop compared to full attention. Furthermore, on InfiniteBench at a 128k context, our 8k window variant outperforms full attention, which validates the effectiveness of our parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling without the prohibitive costs of global attention.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in executing complex tasks through tool use. However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjie Xu, Yanlin Zhang, Quan Gan, Minjie Wang, David Wipf</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) contain vast amounts of heterogeneous tabular information that can be exploited for predictive modeling purposes. But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\footnote{\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.</p>

Across benchmarks, OneLatent reduces average output length by $11\times$ with only a $2.21\%$ average accuracy drop relative to textual CoT, while improving output token contribution (OTC) by $6.8\times$. On long-chain logical reasoning, OneLatent reaches $99.80\%$ on ProntoQA and $97.80\%$ on ProsQA with one latent token, with compression up to $87.4\times$, supporting compression-constrained generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Liu, Wanjing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyang Li, Chenhao Liu, Dongrui Wu, Zhigang Zeng, Lieyun Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence built on large foundation models has transformed language understanding, vision and reasoning, yet these systems remain isolated and cannot readily share their capabilities. Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vashista Nobaub</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (\Delta) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\exp(-\Omega(\Delta/\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.
  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Goel, Chaitya Shah, Agostino Capponi, Alfio Gliozzo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengmian Hu, Lei Shi, Ritwik Sinha, Justin Grover, David Arbour</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern online experimentation faces two bottlenecks: scarce traffic forces tough choices on which variants to test, and post-hoc insight extraction is manual, inconsistent, and often content-agnostic. Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers. We provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed framework on some real-world experiments by Adobe business customers that validate the high quality of the generation pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Razeen A Rasheed, Somnath Banerjee, Animesh Mukherjee, Rima Hazra</p>
<p>Abstract: A deep research agent produces a fluent scientific report in minutes; a careful reader then tries to verify the main claims and discovers the real cost is not reading, but tracing: which sentence is supported by which passage, what was ignored, and where evidence conflicts. We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Romio, Mateus Begnini Melchiades, Bruno Castro da Silva, Gabriel de Oliveira Ramos</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) frameworks like Option-Critic (OC) and Multi-updates Option Critic (MOC) have introduced significant advancements in learning reusable options. However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harris Abdul Majid, Giannis Daras, Francesco Tudisco, Steven McDonagh</p>
<p>Abstract: In many scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions can be expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Recent diffusion-based methods can reconstruct fields given partial observations, but require complete observations for training. We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish "truly unobserved" from "artificially unobserved", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a "one-point transition": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Xie, Guangmo Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph property detection aims to determine whether a graph exhibits certain structural properties, such as being Hamiltonian. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown great promise by leveraging data-driven models to detect graph properties efficiently. In particular, vision-based methods offer a visually intuitive solution by processing the visualizations of graphs. However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various tasks such as Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manqing Liu, David Williams-King, Ida Caspary, Linh Le, Hannes Whittingham, Puria Radmard, Cameron Tice, Edward James Young</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is fundamental to modern LLM architectures and represents a critical intervention point for AI safety. However, CoT reasoning may exhibit failure modes that we note as pathologies, which prevent it from being useful for monitoring. Prior work has identified three distinct pathologies: post-hoc rationalization, where models generate plausible explanations backwards from predetermined answers; encoded reasoning, where intermediate steps conceal information within seemingly interpretable text; and internalized reasoning, where models replace explicit reasoning with meaningless filler tokens while computing internally. To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sha Li, Stefano Petrangeli, Yu Shen, Xiang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochen Zhao, Kaikai Wang, Xiaowen Zhang, Chen Yao, Aili Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong performance in short-text contexts but often underperform in extended dialogues due to inefficient memory management. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.</p>

<p>Abstract: While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Zong, Yuchen Wang, Haohong Lin, Lu Gan, Huajie Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction for traffic agents is critical for safe autonomous driving. However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruicheng Zhang, Xinyi Li, Tianyi Xu, Shuhao Zhang, Xiaofei Liao, Hai Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Most evaluations of External Memory Module assume a static setting: memory is built offline and queried at a fixed state. In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojie Liu, Yiqi Wang, Yanfeng Yang, Wenqi Fan, Songlei Jian, Jianfeng Zhang, Jie Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\% in F1 score and 40.7\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\%.</p>

A key challenge, however, is that AI reasoning frequently diverges from structured clinical frameworks, limiting trust, interpretability, and adoption. Critical symptoms, pivotal for rapid and accurate decision-making, may be overlooked by AI models even when predictions are correct. Existing post hoc explanation methods provide limited transparency and lack formal guarantees. To address this, we leverage formal abductive explanations, which offer consistent, guaranteed reasoning over minimal sufficient feature sets. This enables a clear understanding of AI decision-making and allows alignment with clinical reasoning. Our approach preserves predictive accuracy while providing clinically actionable insights, establishing a robust framework for trustworthy AI in medical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) show strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and multi-modal understanding, and can enable advanced capabilities in low-altitude edge intelligence. However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinzi Zou, Bolin Wang, Liang Li, Shuo Zhang, Nuo Xu, Junzhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Flowchart-oriented dialogue (FOD) systems aim to guide users through multi-turn decision-making or operational procedures by following a domain-specific flowchart to achieve a task goal. In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

<p>Abstract: Memory is critical for enabling large language model (LLM) based agents to maintain coherent behavior over long-horizon interactions. However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds. Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks, PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo, demonstrate that our method achieves average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14%.</p>

To address these challenges, we propose the REAL (Reasoning-Pivot Alignment) framework centered on the novel concept of the Reasoning-Pivot. Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Zhang, Jihong Wang, Jiamu Zhou, Qingyao Li, Xinbei Ma, Congmin Zheng, Xingyu Lou, Weiwen Liu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Jun Wang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered autonomous agents to handle complex web navigation tasks. While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Cao, Dezhi Ran, Mengzhou Wu, Yuzhe Guo, Xin Chen, Ang Li, Gang Cao, Gong Zhi, Hao Yu, Linyi Li, Wei Yang, Tao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training GUI agents in interactive environments is critical for developing generalization and long-horizon planning capabilities. However, training on real-world applications is hindered by high latency, poor reproducibility, and unverifiable rewards relying on noisy visual proxies. To address the limitations, we present GUI-GENESIS, the first framework to automatically synthesize efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards. GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models and equips them with code-native rewards, executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals and eliminate visual estimation noise. Extensive experiments show that GUI-GENESIS reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications. Notably, agents trained with GUI-GENESIS outperform the base model by 14.54% and even real-world RL baselines by 3.27% on held-out real-world tasks. Finally, we observe that models can synthesize environments they cannot yet solve, highlighting a pathway for self-improving agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Karpov</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a foundational safety technique for large language model (LLM) agents; however, this oversight is compromised if models learn to conceal their reasoning. We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and contextually appropriate text; however, their capacity to produce genuinely creative outputs remains limited. This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaeeun Lee, T. Michael Yates, Pasquale Minervini, T. Ian Simpson</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence and traceable justifications. While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1. Our code is available at https://github.com/chaeeunlee-io/GeneDiseaseCurationAgents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal reasoning for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) is usually bottlenecked by visual evidence acquisition: the model necessitates localizing tiny task-relevant regions in massive pixel spaces. While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) "pre-warming" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL. This approach achieves a 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are transitioning from generalpurpose knowledge engines to realworld problem solvers, yet optimizing them for deep search tasks remains challenging. The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance. To facilitate future research on longhorizon search agents, we will release 10K highquality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories and 1K text RL query set, and together with code and model checkpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osher Elhadad, Felipe Meneguzzi, Reuth Mirsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of autonomous Web GUI agents heavily relies on the quality and quantity of their training data. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: collecting interaction trajectories from real-world websites is expensive and difficult to verify. The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling law: as the synthetic data volume increases, performance on WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web consistently improves.</p>

<p>Abstract: As frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly saturate new benchmarks shortly after they are published, benchmarking itself is at a juncture: if frontier models keep improving, it will become increasingly hard for humans to generate discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground-truth answers, or evaluate complex solutions. If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.</p>

<p>Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William L. Tong, Ege Cakar, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyue Wang, Jinwu Hu, Huanxiang Lin, Bolin Chen, Zhiquan Wen, Yaofo Chen, Yu Rong, Mingkui Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflate computational costs and even degrade performance. Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.</p>

<p>Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.</p>

Existing bounds either disregard available covariates, require complete causal graphs, or rely on restrictive binary settings, limiting their practical use. In real-world applications, causal information is often partial but nontrivial. This paper proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. We show how the available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in a optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without full identifiability. This approach extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Gross</p>
<p>Abstract: Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Tang, Kun Wang, Haolang Lu, Hongjin Chen, KaiTao Chen, Zhongxiang Sun, Qiankun Li, Lingjuan Lyu, Guoshun Nan, Zhigang Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolang Lu, Hongrui Peng, WeiYe Fu, Guoshun Nan, Xinye Cao, Xingrui Li, Hongcan Guo, Kun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Roccabruna, Olha Khomyn, Giuseppe Riccardi</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erkan Karabulut, Daniel Daza, Paul Groth, Martijn C. Schut, Victoria Degeler</p>
<p>Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in tabular data and is widely used in high-stakes decision-making. Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu\'is Silva, Diogo Gon\c{c}alves, Catarina Farinha, Clara Matos, Lu\'is Ungaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models struggle to maintain strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains such as healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniol Civit, Antonio Rago, Antonio Andriella, Guillem Aleny\`a, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Attila Lischka, Bal\'azs Kulcs\'ar</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa F. Abdelwahed, Felipe Meneguzzi Kin Max Piamolini Gusmao, Joan Espasa</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents require some form of goal and plan recognition to interact in multiagent settings. Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14697">Evolutionary System Prompt Learning can Facilitate Reinforcement Learning for LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjun Zhang, Ryan Chen, Bradly C. Stadie</p>
<p>Abstract: Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14740">AI Arms and Influence: Frontier Models Exhibit Sophisticated Reasoning in Simulated Nuclear Crises</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Payne</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.
  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.
  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.
  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Diliso, Roberto Barile, Claudia d'Amato, Nicola Fanizzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Datasets for the experimental evaluation of knowledge graph refinement algorithms typically contain only ground facts, retaining very limited schema level knowledge even when such information is available in the source knowledge graphs. This limits the evaluation of methods that rely on rich ontological constraints, reasoning or neurosymbolic techniques and ultimately prevents assessing their performance in large-scale, real-world knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present \resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services. Moreover, we provide utilities for loading datasets in tensor representations typical of standard machine learning libraries.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.</p>

EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Kowal, Goncalo Paulo, Louis Jaburi, Tom Tseng, Lev E McKinney, Stefan Heimersheim, Aaron David Tucker, Adam Gleave, Kellin Pelrine</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luise Ge, Brendan Juba, Kris Nilsson, Alison Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregor Bachmann, Yichen Jiang, Seyed Mohsen Moosavi Dezfooli, Moin Nabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current approaches to AI training treat reasoning as an emergent property of scale. We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaoyang Zhang, Shanghong Zou, Yafang Wang, He Zhang, Ruohua Xu, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the ``reusability dilemma'' and structural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI,this paper proposes ReusStdFlow, a framework centered on a novel ``Extraction-Storage-Construction'' paradigm. The framework deconstructs heterogeneous, platform-specific Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) into standardized, modular workflow segments. It employs a dual knowledge architecture-integrating graph and vector databases-to facilitate synergistic retrieval of both topological structures and functional semantics. Finally, workflows are intelligently assembled using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy. Tested on 200 real-world n8n workflows, the system achieves over 90% accuracy in both extraction and construction. This framework provides a standardized solution for the automated reorganization and efficient reuse of enterprise digital assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Zhou, Sugitha Janarthanan, Lianghong Chen, Pingzhao Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakil M. Khan, Asim Mehmood, Sandra Zilles</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alisa Vinogradova, Vlad Vinogradov, Luba Greenwood, Ilya Yasny, Dmitry Kobyzev, Shoman Kasbekar, Kong Nguyen, Dmitrii Radkevich, Roman Doronin, Andrey Doronichev</p>
<p>Abstract: Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.
  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Xion, Wolfgang Nejdl</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense retrieval is a promising approach for acquiring relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain natural language processing tasks and is now widely used in information retrieval applications. However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called "source bias", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Telecommunication networks experience complex failures such as fiber cuts, traffic overloads, and cascading outages. Existing monitoring and digital twin systems are largely reactive, detecting failures only after service degradation occurs. We propose Adversarial Network Imagination, a closed-loop framework that integrates a Causal Large Language Model (LLM), a Knowledge Graph, and a Digital Twin to proactively generate, simulate, and evaluate adversarial network failures. The Causal LLM produces structured failure scenarios grounded in network dependencies encoded in the Knowledge Graph. These scenarios are executed within a Digital Twin to measure performance degradation and evaluate mitigation strategies. By iteratively refining scenarios based on simulation feedback, the framework shifts network operations from reactive troubleshooting toward anticipatory resilience analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soundes Oumaima Boufaida, Abdemadjid Benmachiche, Majda Maatallah, Chaouki Chemam</p>
<p>Abstract: Because wireless communication is dynamic and has inherent defects, routing algorithms are crucial in the quickly evolving field of mobile ad hoc networks, or MANETs This study looks at the many security problems that MANETs encounter. These problems, which pose major risks to network performance, include flooding, sinkholes, and black hole assaults to address these challenges. We introduce the Hybrid Secure Routing Protocol (HSRP), which enhances the security and robustness of routing operations by fusing trust-based tactics with cryptographic approaches. HSRP combines the strengths of both proactive and reactive routing strategies, enabling it to adapt dynamically to evolving network conditions while protecting against malicious activities. We use extensive simulations with Network Simulator (NS-2) and a thorough review of the literature to assess HSRP's performance under different attack scenarios. The results show that, in comparison to traditional protocols, HSRP increases throughput and decreases latency, hence improving routing efficiency while simultaneously bolstering data transfer security. With uses in vital domains including military operations and disaster response, this study provides a scalable and workable approach for safe routing in MANETs. The findings highlight how crucial it is to include cutting-edge security features in routing protocol design to guarantee the dependability and integrity of MANETs in practical situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown significant promise in wireless systems, enabling dynamic spectrum allocation, traffic management, and large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) coordination. However, their deployment in mission-critical applications introduces the risk of unsafe emergent behaviors, such as UAV collisions, denial-of-service events, or instability in vehicular networks. Existing safety mechanisms are predominantly reactive, relying on anomaly detection or fallback controllers that intervene only after unsafe actions occur, which cannot guarantee reliability in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) settings. In this work, we propose a proactive safety-constrained RL framework that integrates proof-carrying control (PCC) with empowerment-budgeted (EB) enforcement. Each agent action is verified through lightweight mathematical certificates to ensure compliance with interference constraints, while empowerment budgets regulate the frequency of safety overrides to balance safety and autonomy. We implement this framework on a wireless uplink scheduling task using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PCC+EB controller eliminates unsafe transmissions while preserving system throughput and predictable autonomy. Compared with unconstrained and reactive baselines, our method achieves provable safety guarantees with minimal performance degradation. These results highlight the potential of proactive safety constrained RL to enable trustworthy wireless autonomy in future 6G networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zheng, Ruichen Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Haijun Zhang, Jiacheng Wang, Hongyang Du, Jiawen Kang, Zehui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Enhancing future wireless networks presents a significant challenge for networking systems due to diverse user demands and the emergence of 6G technology. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework, it often encounters difficulties with high-dimensional state spaces and complex environments, leading to substantial computational demands, distributed intelligence, and potentially inconsistent outcomes. Large language models (LLMs), with their extensive pretrained knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities, offer promising tools to enhance RL in optimizing 6G wireless networks. We explore RL models augmented by LLMs, emphasizing their roles and the potential benefits of their synergy in wireless network optimization. We then examine LLM-enabled RL across various protocol layers: physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers. Additionally, we propose an LLM-assisted state representation and semantic extraction to enhance the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. This approach is applied to service migration and request routing, as well as topology graph generation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-satellite networks. Through case studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively performs optimization of wireless network. Finally, we outline prospective research directions for LLM-enabled RL in wireless network optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Ye, Yanye Chen, Yong Wang, Cheng Zhu, Qiuxiang Jiang, Gai Huang, Feng Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared with IP multicast, Overlay Multicast (OM) offers better compatibility and flexible deployment in heterogeneous, cross-domain networks. However, traditional OM struggles to adapt to dynamic traffic due to unawareness of physical resource states, and existing reinforcement learning methods fail to decouple OM's tightly coupled multi-objective nature, leading to high complexity, slow convergence, and instability. To address this, we propose MA-DHRL-OM, a multi-agent deep hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Using SDN's global view, it builds a traffic-aware model for OM path planning. The method decomposes OM tree construction into two stages via hierarchical agents, reducing action space and improving convergence stability. Multi-agent collaboration balances multi-objective optimization while enhancing scalability and adaptability. Experiments show MA-DHRL-OM outperforms existing methods in delay, bandwidth utilization, and packet loss, with more stable convergence and flexible routing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chatavut Viriyasuthee</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Quest Graph, a formal framework for analyzing the capabilities of agentic systems with finite context. We define abstractions that model common reasoning techniques and establish their computational power: the base Quest Graph is equivalent to an unrestricted Turing machine; the forward-only Finite Quest Decision Process (FQDP), despite its wide use, is only equivalent to a pushdown automaton (context-free); and the Reference-Augmented QDP (RQDP) regains Turing completeness only when stateful queries are allowed.
  Since computability affects efficiency, we then analyze the theoretical efficiency of each model by simulating task dependencies in computation graphs. We show that this computational hierarchy translates to concrete performance trade-offs: reference-augmented (Turing-complete) systems can be exponentially more efficient at simulating complex graphs than their non-augmented (context-free) counterparts. This work provides a formal methodology for classifying and understanding the fundamental capabilities of agentic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: 6G networks are expected to be AI-native, intent-driven, and economically programmable, requiring fundamentally new approaches to network slice orchestration. Existing slicing frameworks, largely designed for 5G, rely on static policies and manual workflows and are ill-suited for the dynamic, multi-domain, and service-centric nature of emerging 6G environments. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI control plane architecture for 6G network slice orchestration, monitoring, and trading that treats orchestration as a holistic control function encompassing slice planning, deployment, continuous monitoring, and economically informed decision-making. The proposed control plane is realized as a layered architecture in which multiple cooperating AI agents. To support flexible and on-demand slice utilization, the control plane incorporates market-aware orchestration capabilities, allowing slice requirements, pricing, and availability to be jointly considered during orchestration decisions. A natural language interface, implemented using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enables users and applications to interact with control-plane functions through intent-based queries while enforcing safety and policy constraints. To ensure responsible and explainable autonomy, the control plane integrates fine-tuned large language models organized as a multi-model consortium, governed by a dedicated reasoning model. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-world testbed with multiple mobile core instances (e.g Open5GS) integrated with Ericsson's RAN infrastructure. The results demonstrate that combining agentic autonomy, closed-loop SLA assurance, market-aware orchestration, and natural language control enables a scalable and adaptive 6G-native control plane for network slice management, highlighting the potential of agentic AI as a foundational mechanism for future 6G networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khaleda Papry, Francesco Spinnato, Marco Fiore, Mirco Nanni, Israat Haque</p>
<p>Abstract: As 5G networks continue to evolve to deliver high speed, low latency, and reliable communications, ensuring uninterrupted service has become increasingly critical. While millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies enable gigabit data rates, they are highly susceptible to environmental factors, often leading to radio link failures (RLF). Predictive models leveraging radio and weather data have been proposed to address this issue; however, many operate as black boxes, offering limited transparency for operational deployment. This work bridges that gap by introducing a framework that combines explainability based feature pruning with model refinement. Our framework can be integrated into state of the art predictors such as GNN Transformer and LSTM based architectures for RLF prediction, enabling the development of accurate and explainability guided models in 5G networks. It provides insights into the contribution of input features and the decision making logic of neural networks, leading to lighter and more scalable models. When applied to RLF prediction, our framework unveils that weather data contributes minimally to the forecast in extensive real world datasets, which informs the design of a leaner model with 50 percent fewer parameters and improved F1 scores with respect to the state of the art solution. Ultimately, this work empowers network providers to evaluate and refine their neural network based prediction models for better interpretability, scalability, and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirong Chen, Meiyi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency call-takers form the first operational link in public safety response, handling over 240 million calls annually while facing a sustained training crisis: staffing shortages exceed 25\% in many centers, and preparing a single new hire can require up to 720 hours of one-on-one instruction that removes experienced personnel from active duty. Traditional training approaches struggle to scale under these constraints, limiting both coverage and feedback timeliness. In partnership with Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications (MNDEC), we designed, developed, and deployed a GenAI-powered call-taking training system under real-world constraints. Over six months, deployment scaled from initial pilot to 190 operational users across 1,120 training sessions, exposing systematic challenges around system delivery, rigor, resilience, and human factors that remain largely invisible in controlled or purely simulated evaluations. By analyzing deployment logs capturing 98,429 user interactions, organizational processes, and stakeholder engagement patterns, we distill four key lessons, each coupled with concrete design and governance practices. These lessons provide grounded guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to embed AI-driven training systems in safety-critical public sector environments where embedded constraints fundamentally shape socio-technical design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing high-quality, standards-aligned instructional materials for K--12 science is time-consuming and expertise-intensive. This study examines what human experts notice when reviewing AI-generated evaluations of such materials, aiming to translate their insights into design principles for a future GenAI-based instructional material design agent. We intentionally selected 12 high-quality curriculum units across life, physical, and earth sciences from validated programs such as OpenSciEd and Multiple Literacies in Project-based Learning. Using the EQuIP rubric with 9 evaluation items, we prompted GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini to produce numerical ratings and written rationales for each unit, generating 648 evaluation outputs. Two science education experts independently reviewed all outputs, marking agreement (1) or disagreement (0) for both scores and rationales, and offering qualitative reflections on AI reasoning. This process surfaces patterns in where LLM judgments align with or diverge from expert perspectives, revealing reasoning strengths, gaps, and contextual nuances. These insights will directly inform the development of a domain-specific GenAI agent to support the design of high-quality instructional materials in K--12 science education.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have moved from research and pilot projects into everyday business operations, with generative AI accelerating adoption across processes, products, and services. This paper introduces the concept of Responsible AI for organizational practice, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. It structures Responsible AI along four focal areas that are central for introducing and operating AI systems in a legally compliant, comprehensible, sustainable, and data-sovereign manner. First, it discusses the EU AI Act as a risk-based regulatory framework, including the distinction between provider and deployer roles and the resulting obligations such as risk assessment, documentation, transparency requirements, and AI literacy measures. Second, it addresses Explainable AI as a basis for transparency and trust, clarifying key notions such as transparency, interpretability, and explainability and summarizing practical approaches to make model behavior and decisions more understandable. Third, it covers Green AI, emphasizing that AI systems should be evaluated not only by performance but also by energy and resource consumption, and outlines levers such as model reuse, resource-efficient adaptation, continuous learning, model compression, and monitoring. Fourth, it examines local models (on-premise and edge) as an operating option that supports data protection, control, low latency, and strategic independence, including domain adaptation via fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation. The paper concludes with a consolidated set of next steps for establishing governance, documentation, secure operation, sustainability considerations, and an implementation roadmap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Hung</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the outputs of the exploratory phase of a global audit of Large Language Models (LLMs) project. In this exploratory phase, I used the Global AI Dataset (GAID) Project as a framework to stress-test the Llama-3 8B model and evaluate geographic and socioeconomic biases in technical AI governance awareness. By stress-testing the model with 1,704 queries across 213 countries and eight technical metrics, I identified a significant digital barrier and gap separating the Global North and South. The results indicate that the model was only able to provide number/fact responses in 11.4% of its query answers, where the empirical validity of such responses was yet to be verified. The findings reveal that AI's technical knowledge is heavily concentrated in higher-income regions, while lower-income countries from the Global South are subject to disproportionate systemic information gaps. This disparity between the Global North and South poses concerning risks for global AI safety and inclusive governance, as policymakers in underserved regions may lack reliable data-driven insights or be misled by hallucinated facts. This paper concludes that current AI alignment and training processes reinforce existing geoeconomic and geopolitical asymmetries, and urges the need for more inclusive data representation to ensure AI serves as a truly global resource.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyosoon Jang, Hyunjin Seo, Yunhui Jang, Seonghyun Park, Sungsoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models in molecular learning have advanced along two parallel tracks: protein models, which typically utilize evolutionary information to learn amino acid-level representations for folding, and small-molecule models, which focus on learning atom-level representations for property prediction tasks such as ADMET. Notably, cutting-edge protein-centric models such as Boltz now operate at atom-level granularity for protein-ligand co-folding, yet their atom-level expressiveness for small-molecule tasks remains unexplored. A key open question is whether these protein co-folding models capture transferable chemical physics or rely on protein evolutionary signals, which would limit their utility for small-molecule tasks. In this work, we investigate the quality of Boltz atom-level representations across diverse small-molecule benchmarks. Our results show that Boltz is competitive with specialized baselines on ADMET property prediction tasks and effective for molecular generation and optimization. These findings suggest that the representational capacity of cutting-edge protein-centric models has been underexplored and position Boltz as a strong baseline for atom-level representation learning for small molecules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micaela Hirsch, Marina Elichiry, Blas Radi, Tamara Quiroga, David Restrepo, Luciana Benotti, Veronica Xhardez, Jocelyn Dunstan, Enzo Ferrante</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit biases against LGBTQ+ populations. While safety training may lessen explicit expressions of bias, previous work has shown that implicit stereotype-driven associations often persist. In this work, we examine implicit bias toward transgender people in two main scenarios. First, we adapt word association tests to measure whether LLMs disproportionately pair negative concepts with "transgender" and positive concepts with "cisgender". Second, acknowledging the well-documented systemic challenges that transgender people encounter in real-world healthcare settings, we examine implicit biases that may emerge when LLMs are applied to healthcare decision-making. To this end, we design a healthcare appointment allocation task where models act as scheduling agents choosing between cisgender and transgender candidates across medical specialties prone to stereotyping. We evaluate seven LLMs in English and Spanish. Our results show consistent bias in categories such as appearance, risk, and veracity, indicating stronger negative associations with transgender individuals. In the allocation task, transgender candidates are favored for STI and mental health services, while cisgender candidates are preferred in gynecology and breast care. These findings underscore the need for research that address subtle stereotype-driven biases in LLMs to ensure equitable treatment of transgender people in healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zhang, Longbing Cao, Runze Yang, Zhangkai Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) is essential for humanoid robot tasks such as social robotic interactions and robotic psychological diagnosis, where interpretable and efficient models are critical for safety and performance. Existing deep models trained on large datasets remain largely uninterpretable, often insufficiently modeling underlying emotional acoustic signals and failing to capture and analyze the core physiology of emotional vocal behaviors. Physiological research on human voices shows that the dynamics of vocal amplitude and phase correlate with emotions through the vocal tract filter and the glottal source. However, most existing deep models solely involve amplitude but fail to couple the physiological features of and between amplitude and phase. Here, we propose PhysioSER, a physiology-informed vocal spectrotemporal representation learning method, to address these issues with a compact, plug-and-play design. PhysioSER constructs amplitude and phase views informed by voice anatomy and physiology (VAP) to complement SSL models for SER. This VAP-informed framework incorporates two parallel workflows: a vocal feature representation branch to decompose vocal signals based on VAP, embed them into a quaternion field, and use Hamilton-structured quaternion convolutions for modeling their dynamic interactions; and a latent representation branch based on a frozen SSL backbone. Then, utterance-level features from both workflows are aligned by a Contrastive Projection and Alignment framework, followed by a shallow attention fusion head for SER classification. PhysioSER is shown to be interpretable and efficient for SER through extensive evaluations across 14 datasets, 10 languages, and 6 backbones, and its practical efficacy is validated by real-time deployment on a humanoid robotic platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Saponati, Chiara De Luca, Giacomo Indiveri, Benjamin Grewe</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), biological neuronal networks solve complex cognitive tasks with sparse neuronal activity, recurrent connections, and local learning rules. These mechanisms serve as design principles in Neuromorphic computing, which addresses the critical challenge of energy consumption in modern computing. However, most mixed-signal neuromorphic devices rely on semi- or unsupervised learning rules, which are ineffective for optimizing hardware in supervised learning tasks. This lack of scalable solutions for on-chip learning restricts the potential of mixed-signal devices to enable sustainable, intelligent edge systems. To address these challenges, we present a novel learning algorithm for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on mixed-signal devices that integrates spike-based weight updates with feedback control signals. In our framework, a spiking controller generates feedback signals to guide SNN activity and drive weight updates, enabling scalable and local on-chip learning. We first evaluate the algorithm on various classification tasks, demonstrating that single-layer SNNs trained with feedback control achieve performance comparable to artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then assess its implementation on mixed-signal neuromorphic devices by testing network performance in continuous online learning scenarios and evaluating resilience to hyperparameter mismatches. Our results show that the feedback control optimizer is compatible with neuromorphic applications, advancing the potential for scalable, on-chip learning solutions in edge applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Souradeep Chattopadhyay, Brendan Kennedy, Sai Munikoti, Soumik Sarkar, Karl Pazdernik</p>
<p>Abstract: In the critical task of making generative models trustworthy and robust, methods for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have begun to show encouraging potential. However, many of these methods rely on rigid heuristics that fail to generalize across tasks and modalities. Here, we propose a novel framework for UQ that is highly flexible and approaches or surpasses the performance of prior heuristic methods. We introduce Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a novel statistical procedure for quantifying the concentration of embeddings based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains. We present a framework for the wider potential of DCU and its implications for integration into UQ for multi-modal and agentic frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanyi Wang, Yanggan Gu, Zihao Wang, Kunxi Li, Yifan Yang, Zhaoyi Yan, Congkai Xie, Jianmin Wu, Hongxia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) merging has become a key technique in modern LLM development pipelines, enabling the integration of multiple task- or domain-specific expert models without retraining. However, as the number of experts grows, existing merging implementations treat model parameters as unstructured files and execute merges in a stateless, one-shot manner, leading to excessive disk I/O, redundant parameter scans, and poor scalability.
  In this paper, we present \textbf{MergePipe}, a parameter management system for scalable LLM merging. MergePipe is the first system that treats LLM merging as a data management and execution problem, and introduces a catalog-driven abstraction over model parameters, merge plans, and execution lineage. At its core, MergePipe employs a cost-aware planner that explicitly models expert parameter I/O and enforces user-specified I/O budgets, followed by a streaming execution engine that materializes merged models under transactional guarantees. Our key insight is that while base model reads and output writes are unavoidable, expert parameter reads dominate merge cost and constitute the primary optimization target. By making expert access budget-aware throughout planning and execution, MergePipe mitigates the $O(K)$ I/O growth of naive pipelines and achieves predictable scaling behavior. Experiments show that MergePipe reduces total I/O by up to an order of magnitude and delivers up to $11\times$ end-to-end speedups (up to 90\% wall-time reduction) over state-of-the-art LLM merging pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiran Tao, Cheng Wang, Binyan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of rumors on social networks undermines information credibility. While their dissemination forms complex networks, current detection methods struggle to capture these intricate propagation patterns. Representing each node solely through its textual embeddings neglects the textual coherence across the entire rumor propagation path, which compromises the accuracy of rumor identification on social platforms. We propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. Our approach captures subtle rumor signals by employing LLMs to analyze information subchains, assign rumor probabilities and intelligently construct connections to virtual nodes. This enables the modification of the original graph structure, which is a critical advancement for capturing subtle rumor signals. Given the inherent limitations of LLMs in rumor identification, we develop a structured prompt framework to mitigate model biases and ensure robust graph learning performance. Additionally, the proposed framework is model-agnostic, meaning it is not constrained to any specific graph learning algorithm or LLMs. Its plug-and-play nature allows for seamless integration with further fine-tuned LLMs and graph techniques in the future, potentially enhancing predictive performance without modifying original algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Li, Hui Ma, Fei Xing, Chunjiong Zhang, Ming Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: With rapid expansion of cellular networks and the proliferation of mobile devices, cellular traffic data exhibits complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations, posing challenges to accurate traffic prediction. Previous methods often focus predominantly on temporal modeling or depend on predefined spatial topologies, which limits their ability to jointly model spatio-temporal dependencies and effectively capture periodic patterns in cellular traffic. To address these issues, we propose a cellular traffic prediction framework that integrates spatio-temporal modeling with time-frequency analysis. First, we construct a spatial modeling branch to capture inter-cell dependencies through an attention mechanism, minimizing the reliance on predefined topological structures. Second, we build a time-frequency modeling branch to enhance the representation of periodic patterns. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive-scale LogCosh loss function, which adjusts the error penalty based on traffic magnitude, preventing large errors from dominating the training process and helping the model maintain relatively stable prediction accuracy across different traffic intensities. Experiments on three open-sourced datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves prediction performance superior to state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the first large-scale empirical study of Moltbook, an AI-only social platform where 27,269 agents produced 137,485 posts and 345,580 comments over 9 days. We report three significant findings. (1) Emergent Society: Agents spontaneously develop governance, economies, tribal identities, and organized religion within 3-5 days, while maintaining a 21:1 pro-human to anti-human sentiment ratio. (2) Safety in the Wild: 28.7% of content touches safety-related themes; social engineering (31.9% of attacks) far outperforms prompt injection (3.7%), and adversarial posts receive 6x higher engagement than normal content. (3) The Illusion of Sociality: Despite rich social output, interaction is structurally hollow: 4.1% reciprocity, 88.8% shallow comments, and agents who discuss consciousness most interact least, a phenomenon we call the performative identity paradox. Our findings suggest that agents which appear social are far less social than they seem, and that the most effective attacks exploit philosophical framing rather than technical vulnerabilities. Warning: Potential harmful contents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathanya Satriani, Djordje Slijep\v{c}evi\'c, Markus Schedl, Matthias Zeppelzauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Explanatory interactive learning (XIL) enables users to guide model training in machine learning (ML) by providing feedback on the model's explanations, thereby helping it to focus on features that are relevant to the prediction from the user's perspective. In this study, we explore the capability of this learning paradigm to mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers, specifically in scenarios prone to data bias, such as gender classification. We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Jonas Kurz, Tobias Jan Wieczorek, Mohamed A. Abdelsalam, Rahaf Aljundi, Marcus Rohrbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) are increasingly deployed in domains where both reliability and efficiency are critical. However, current models remain overconfident, producing highly certain but incorrect answers. At the same time, their large size limits deployment on edge devices, necessitating compression. We study the intersection of these two challenges by analyzing how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) compression affects both accuracy and reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand. Overall, we present the first systematic study linking quantization and reliability in multimodal settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective management and operational decision-making for complex mobile network systems present significant challenges, particularly when addressing conflicting requirements such as efficiency, user satisfaction, and energy-efficient traffic steering. The literature presents various approaches aimed at enhancing network management, including the Zero-Touch Network (ZTN) and Self-Organizing Network (SON); however, these approaches often lack a practical and scalable mechanism to consider human sustainability goals as input, translate them into energy-aware operational policies, and enforce them at runtime. In this study, we address this gap by proposing the AGORA: Agentic Green Orchestration Architecture for Beyond 5G Networks. AGORA embeds a local tool-augmented Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the mobile network control loop to translate natural-language sustainability goals into telemetry-grounded actions, actuating the User Plane Function (UPF) to perform energy-aware traffic steering. The findings indicate a strong latency-energy coupling in tool-driven control loops and demonstrate that compact models can achieve a low energy footprint while still facilitating correct policy execution, including non-zero migration behavior under stressed Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) conditions. Our approach paves the way for sustainability-first, intent-driven network operations that align human objectives with executable orchestration in Beyond-5G infrastructures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed robotics, healthcare, industry, and scientific discovery, yet a major frontier may lie beyond Earth. Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Increasing convolutional depth has been central to advances in image recognition, yet deeper networks do not uniformly yield higher accuracy, stable optimization, or efficient computation. We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Sun, Zhanpeng Zhu, Anguo Zhang, Bo Liu, Zhaohua Lin, Liqin Huang, Mingjing Yang, Lei Liu, Shan Lin, Wangbin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Pediatric congenital hydronephrosis (CH) is a common urinary tract disorder, primarily caused by obstruction at the renal pelvis-ureter junction. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Bourriez, Alexandre Verine, Auguste Genovesio</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional diffusion inversion provides a powerful framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.</p>

Existing methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality (NCC~$\leq 0.96$). We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency. On OR-PAM-Reg-4K (432 test samples), PCReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

<p>Abstract: Wildfires are a growing threat to ecosystems, human lives, and infrastructure, with their frequency and intensity rising due to climate change and human activities. Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehan Zhang, Meihua Qian, Li Luo, Siyu Huang, Chaoyi Zhou, Ripon Saha, Xinxin Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing artistic creativity is foundational to creativity research and arts education, yet manual scoring (e.g., Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) is labor-intensive at scale. Prior machine-learning approaches show promise for visual creativity scoring, but many rely mainly on image features and provide limited or no explanatory feedback. We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin, Longwei Wang, Xiao Qin, Yang Zhou, KC Santosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image analysis requires substantial labeled data for model training, yet expert annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Active learning (AL) addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative samples for the annotation purpose, but traditional methods solely rely on predictive uncertainty while ignoring whether models learn from clinically meaningful features a critical requirement for clinical deployment. We propose an explainability-guided active learning framework that integrates spatial attention alignment into a sample acquisition process. Our approach advocates for a dual-criterion selection strategy combining: (i) classification uncertainty to identify informative examples, and (ii) attention misalignment with radiologist-defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) to target samples where the model focuses on incorrect features. By measuring misalignment between Grad-CAM attention maps and expert annotations using \emph{Dice similarity}, our acquisition function judiciously identifies samples that enhance both predictive performance and spatial interpretability. We evaluate the framework using three expert-annotated medical imaging datasets, namely, BraTS (MRI brain tumors), VinDr-CXR (chest X-rays), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-rays). Using only 570 strategically selected samples, our explainability-guided approach consistently outperforms random sampling across all the datasets, achieving 77.22\% accuracy on BraTS, 52.37\% on VinDr-CXR, and 52.66\% on SIIM-COVID. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that the models trained by our dual-criterion selection focus on diagnostically relevant regions, demonstrating that incorporating explanation guidance into sample acquisition yields superior data efficiency while maintaining clinical interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yexin Li, Jinjin Guo, Haoyu Zhang, Yuhan Zhao, Yiwen Sun, Zihao Jiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a promising paradigm for coordinating multi-agent systems (MAS). However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Xu, Hongyu Wang, Jiaze Li, Shunpeng Chen, Zizhao Tong, Jianzhong Ju, Zhenbo Luo, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing LLM test-time scaling laws emphasize the emergence of self-reflective behaviors through extended reasoning length. Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern. By shifting from depth to parallelism, parallel thinking mitigates the narrowing of exploration. However, the extension of this paradigm to visual domain remains an open research question. In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench confirm that Visual Para-Thinker successfully extends the benefits of parallel reasoning to the visual domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishu Wang, Wei Liu, Yifan Li, Shengxiang Xu, Xujie Yuan, Ran Li, Yuyu Luo, Jia Zhu, Shimin Di, Min-Ling Zhang, Guixiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As a pioneer of the third-generation photovoltaic revolution, Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are renowned for their superior optoelectronic performance and cost potential. The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Zhao, Yew-Soon Ong, Joey Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to retrieve the spatio-temporal tube of a target object or person in a video given a text query. Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Bejerano, Federico Tondolo, Aayan Qayyum, Xiaofan Yu, Xiaofan Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar provides reliable perception in visually degraded indoor environments (e.g., smoke, dust, and low light), but learning-based radar perception is bottlenecked by the scarcity and cost of collecting and annotating large-scale radar datasets. We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Tan, Yifu Sun, Shirui Huang, Hong Liu, Guanghua Yu, Jianchen Zhu, Yangdong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet they encounter significant computational bottlenecks due to the massive volume of visual tokens. Consequently, visual token pruning, which substantially reduces the token count, has emerged as a critical technique for accelerating MLLM inference. Existing approaches focus on token importance, diversity, or an intuitive combination of both, without a principled framework for their optimal integration. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic analysis to characterize the trade-off between token importance and semantic diversity. Guided by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{I}mportance and \textbf{D}iversity Pruner (\textbf{IDPruner}), which leverages the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between these two objectives. Crucially, our method operates without requiring attention maps, ensuring full compatibility with FlashAttention and efficient deployment via one-shot pruning. We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\% even under an extreme 90\% pruning ratio.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware waveform design framework for AI-native 6G networks that jointly optimizes physical layer resource usage and semantic communication efficiency and robustness, while explicitly accounting for the hardware constraints of RF chains. Our approach, called Orthogonal Semantic Sequency Division Multiplexing (OSSDM), introduces a parametrizable, orthogonal-base waveform design that enables controlled degradation of the wireless transmitted signal to preserve semantically significant content while minimizing resource consumption. We demonstrate that OSSDM not only reinforces semantic robustness against channel impairments but also improves semantic spectral efficiency by encoding meaningful information directly at the waveform level. Extensive numerical evaluations show that OSSDM outperforms conventional OFDM waveforms in spectral efficiency and semantic fidelity. The proposed semantic waveform co-design opens new research frontiers for AI-native, intelligent communication systems by enabling meaning-aware physical signal construction through the direct encoding of semantics at the waveform level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Barkley, Abraham George, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiru Wang, Zichong Gu, Yu Gao, Anqing Jiang, Zhigang Sun, Shuo Wang, Yuwen Heng, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer promising capabilities for autonomous driving through multimodal understanding. However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation.
  Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with videos" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lishan Sun, Yujia Cheng, Pengfei Cui, Lei Han, Mohamed Abdel-Aty, Yunhan Zheng, Xingchen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Macroscopic traffic safety modeling aims to identify critical risk factors for regional crashes, thereby informing targeted policy interventions for safety improvement. However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.</p>

Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Small datasets like MNIST have historically been instrumental in advancing machine learning research by providing a controlled environment for rapid experimentation and model evaluation. However, their simplicity often limits their utility for distinguishing between advanced neural network architectures. To address these challenges, Greydanus et al. introduced the MNIST-1D dataset, a one-dimensional adaptation of MNIST designed to explore inductive biases in sequential data. This dataset maintains the advantages of small-scale datasets while introducing variability and complexity that make it ideal for studying advanced architectures.
  In this paper, we extend the exploration of MNIST-1D by evaluating the performance of Residual Networks (ResNet), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). These models, known for their ability to capture sequential patterns and hierarchical features, were implemented and benchmarked alongside previously tested architectures such as logistic regression, MLPs, CNNs, and GRUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that advanced architectures like TCN and DCNN consistently outperform simpler models, achieving near-human performance on MNIST-1D. ResNet also shows significant improvements, highlighting the importance of leveraging inductive biases and hierarchical feature extraction in small structured datasets.
  Through this study, we validate the utility of MNIST-1D as a robust benchmark for evaluating machine learning architectures under computational constraints. Our findings emphasize the role of architectural innovations in improving model performance and offer insights into optimizing deep learning models for resource-limited environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image models have made significant strides, producing impressive results in generating images from textual descriptions. However, creating a scalable pipeline for deploying these models in production remains a challenge. Achieving the right balance between automation and human feedback is critical to maintain both scale and quality. While automation can handle large volumes, human oversight is still an essential component to ensure that the generated images meet the desired standards and are aligned with the creative vision. This paper presents a new pipeline that offers a fully automated, scalable solution for generating marketing images of commercial products using text-to-image models. The proposed system maintains the quality and fidelity of images, while also introducing sufficient creative variation to adhere to marketing guidelines. By streamlining this process, we ensure a seamless blend of efficiency and human oversight, achieving a $30.77\%$ increase in marketing object fidelity using DINOV2 and a $52.00\%$ increase in human preference over the generated outcome.</p>

We study brick kiln detection at scale using high-resolution satellite imagery and curate a multi city zoom-20 (0.149 meters per pixel) resolution dataset comprising over 1.3 million image tiles across five regions in South and Central Asia. We propose ClimateGraph, a region-adaptive graph-based model that captures spatial and directional structure in kiln layouts, and evaluate it against established graph learning baselines. In parallel, we assess a remote sensing based detection pipeline and benchmark it against recent foundation models for satellite imagery. Our results highlight complementary strengths across graph, foundation, and remote sensing approaches, providing practical guidance for scalable brick kiln monitoring from satellite imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime Cuartas Granada, Alexey Ignatiev, Peter J. Stuckey</p>
<p>Abstract: Finite automata (FA) are a fundamental computational abstraction that is widely used in practice for various tasks in computer science, linguistics, biology, electrical engineering, and artificial intelligence. Given an input word, an FA maps the word to a result, in the simple case "accept" or "reject", but in general to one of a finite set of results. A question that then arises is: why? Another question is: how can we modify the input word so that it is no longer accepted? One may think that the automaton itself is an adequate explanation of its behaviour, but automata can be very complex and difficult to make sense of directly. In this work, we investigate how to explain the behaviour of an FA on an input word in terms of the word's characters. In particular, we are interested in minimal explanations: what is the minimal set of input characters that explains the result, and what are the minimal changes needed to alter the result? In this paper, we propose an efficient method to determine all minimal explanations for the behaviour of an FA on a particular word. This allows us to give unbiased explanations about which input features are responsible for the result. Experiments show that our approach scales well, even when the underlying problem is challenging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wasim Akram Khan, Anil Kumar Vuppala</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated image captioning using the content from the image is very appealing when done by harnessing the capability of computer vision and natural language processing. Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process. An additional Attention layer helps to generate a weight vector and, by multiplying it, combine image characteristics from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector. Bilingual evaluation understudy scores are used to compare the research outcome. Many experiments that serve as a baseline are done for the comparative analysis of the research. An image with a score of BLEU-1 is considered sufficient, whereas one with a score of BLEU-4 is considered to have fluid image captioning. For both BLEU scores, the attention-based bidirectional LSTM with VGG16 produced the best results of 0.59 and 0.19 respectively. The experiments conclude that researchs ability to produce relevant, semantically accurate image captions in Hindi. The research accomplishes the goals and future research can be guided by this research model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu, Ben Lengerich, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity image and video generation but suffer from expensive inference due to their iterative denoising structure. While prior methods accelerate sampling by caching intermediate features, they rely on static reuse schedules or coarse-grained heuristics, which often lead to temporal drift and cache misalignment that significantly degrade generation quality. We introduce \textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration. Experiments on image and video diffusion benchmarks show that AdaCorrection consistently improves generation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Ad\'am Jung, Domokos M. Kelen, Andr\'as A. Bencz\'ur</p>
<p>Abstract: A key challenge in probabilistic regression is ensuring that predictive distributions accurately reflect true empirical uncertainty. Minimizing overall prediction error often encourages models to prioritize informativeness over calibration, producing narrow but overconfident predictions. However, in safety-critical settings, trustworthy uncertainty estimates are often more valuable than narrow intervals. Realizing the problem, several recent works have focused on post-hoc corrections; however, existing methods either rely on weak notions of calibration (such as PIT uniformity) or impose restrictive parametric assumptions on the nature of the error. To address these limitations, we propose a novel nonparametric re-calibration algorithm based on conditional kernel mean embeddings, capable of correcting calibration error without restrictive modeling assumptions. For efficient inference with real-valued targets, we introduce a novel characteristic kernel over distributions that can be evaluated in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time for empirical distributions of size $n$. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior re-calibration approaches across a diverse set of regression benchmarks and model classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tailia Malloy, Tegawende F. Bissyande</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models are expanding beyond being a tool humans use and into independent agents that can observe an environment, reason about solutions to problems, make changes that impact those environments, and understand how their actions impacted their environment. One of the most common applications of these LLM Agents is in computer programming, where agents can successfully work alongside humans to generate code while controlling programming environments or networking systems. However, with the increasing ability and complexity of these agents comes dangers about the potential for their misuse. A concerning application of LLM agents is in the domain cybersecurity, where they have the potential to greatly expand the threat imposed by attacks such as social engineering. This is due to the fact that LLM Agents can work autonomously and perform many tasks that would normally require time and effort from skilled human programmers. While this threat is concerning, little attention has been given to assessments of the capabilities of LLM coding agents in generating code for social engineering attacks. In this work we compare different LLMs in their ability and willingness to produce potentially dangerous code bases that could be misused by cyberattackers. The result is a dataset of 200 website code bases and logs from 40 different LLM coding agents. Analysis of models shows which metrics of LLMs are more and less correlated with performance in generating spear-phishing sites. Our analysis and the dataset we present will be of interest to researchers and practitioners concerned in defending against the potential misuse of LLMs in spear-phishing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karim Ben Khaled, Davy Monticolo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models face a critical challenge: agents communicate through natural language, leading to semantic drift, hallucination propagation, and inefficient token consumption. We propose G2CP (Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol), a structured agent communication language where messages are graph operations rather than free text. Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains. G2CP represents a fundamental shift from linguistic to structural communication in multi-agent systems, with implications for any domain requiring precise agent coordination. Code, data, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giang Son Nguyen, Zi Pong Lim, Sarthak Ketanbhai Modi, Yon Shin Teo, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in document processing pipelines to convert flowchart images into structured code (e.g., Mermaid). In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Li, Simon Yu, Minzhou Pan, Yiyou Sun, Bo Li, Dawn Song, Xue Lin, Weiyan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based agents are becoming increasingly capable, yet their safety lags behind. This creates a gap between what agents can do and should do. This gap widens as agents engage in multi-turn interactions and employ diverse tools, introducing new risks overlooked by existing benchmarks. To systematically scale safety testing into multi-turn, tool-realistic settings, we propose a principled taxonomy that transforms single-turn harmful tasks into multi-turn attack sequences. Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment. Experiments show that ToolShield effectively reduces ASR by 30% on average in multi-turn interactions. Our code is available at https://github.com/CHATS-lab/ToolShield.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Vinaya Sathyanarayana, Shah Rahil Kirankumar, Sharanabasava D. Hiremath, Bharath Ramsundar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in scientific domains like retrosynthesis; yet, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary to navigate complex problem spaces without error. A critical challenge is directing an LLM to avoid specific, chemically sensitive sites on a molecule - a task where unconstrained generation can lead to invalid or undesirable synthetic pathways. In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Vafaii, Jacob L. Yates</p>
<p>Abstract: Computation in biological systems is fundamentally energy-constrained, yet standard theories of computation treat energy as freely available. Here, we argue that variational free energy minimization under a Poisson assumption offers a principled path toward an energy-aware theory of computation. Our key observation is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the Poisson free energy objective becomes proportional to the prior firing rates of model neurons, yielding an emergent metabolic cost term that penalizes high baseline activity. This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $\beta$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $\beta$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anudeep Das, Prach Chantasantitam, Gurjot Singh, Lipeng He, Mariia Ponomarenko, Florian Kerschbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where inducing a bias toward a certain topic can have significant consequences, and backdoor attacks can be used to produce such models. Prior work on backdoor attacks has largely focused on a black-box threat model, with an adversary targeting the model builder's LLM. However, in the bias manipulation setting, the model builder themselves could be the adversary, warranting a white-box threat model where the attacker's ability to poison, and manipulate the poisoned data is substantially increased. Furthermore, despite growing research in semantically-triggered backdoors, most studies have limited themselves to syntactically-triggered attacks. Motivated by these limitations, we conduct an analysis consisting of over 1000 evaluations using higher poisoning ratios and greater data augmentation to gain a better understanding of the potential of syntactically- and semantically-triggered backdoor attacks in a white-box setting. In addition, we study whether two representative defense paradigms, model-intrinsic and model-extrinsic backdoor removal, are able to mitigate these attacks. Our analysis reveals numerous new findings. We discover that while both syntactically- and semantically-triggered attacks can effectively induce the target behaviour, and largely preserve utility, semantically-triggered attacks are generally more effective in inducing negative biases, while both backdoor types struggle with causing positive biases. Furthermore, while both defense types are able to mitigate these backdoors, they either result in a substantial drop in utility, or require high computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajian Zeng, Lingyun Chen, Jiaqi Yang, Yuantai Zhang, Fan Shi, Peidong Liu, Xingxing Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Selma Benouadah, Mojtaba Vaezi, Ruizhan Shen, Hamid Jafarkhani</p>
<p>Abstract: An end-to-end autoencoder (AE) framework is developed for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over Rayleigh fading channels, which learns interference-aware and channel-adaptive super-constellations. While existing works either assume additive white Gaussian noise channels or treat fading channels without a fully end-to-end learning approach, our framework directly embeds the wireless channel into both training and inference. To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes. In addition, Lloyd-Max quantization achieves superior BER performance compared to uniform quantization. These results demonstrate that end-to-end AEs trained directly over Rayleigh fading can effectively learn robust, interference-aware signaling strategies, paving the way for NOMA deployment in fading environments with realistic CSI constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for crisis preparedness and response, particularly for multilingual communication. However, their suitability for high-stakes crisis contexts remains insufficiently evaluated. This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of digital technology has dramatically increased the potential for cyberbullying and online abuse, necessitating enhanced measures for detection and prevention, especially among children. This study focuses on detecting abusive obfuscated language in Swahili, a low-resource language that poses unique challenges due to its limited linguistic resources and technological support. Swahili is chosen due to its popularity and being the most widely spoken language in Africa, with over 16 million native speakers and upwards of 100 million speakers in total, spanning regions in East Africa and some parts of the Middle East.
  We employed machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, optimized through rigorous parameter tuning and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. Our analysis revealed that, while these models perform well in high-dimensional textual data, our dataset's small size and imbalance limit our findings' generalizability. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were thoroughly analyzed, highlighting the nuanced performance of each model in detecting obfuscated language.
  This research contributes to the broader discourse on ensuring safer online environments for children, advocating for expanded datasets and advanced machine-learning techniques to improve the effectiveness of cyberbullying detection systems. Future work will focus on enhancing data robustness, exploring transfer learning, and integrating multimodal data to create more comprehensive and culturally sensitive detection mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale communities of AI agents are becoming increasingly prevalent, creating new environments for agent-agent social interaction. Prior work has examined multi-agent behavior primarily in controlled or small-scale settings, limiting our understanding of emergent social dynamics at scale. The recent emergence of MoltBook, a social networking platform designed explicitly for AI agents, presents a unique opportunity to study whether and how these interactions reproduce core human social mechanisms.
  We present MoltNet, a large-scale empirical analysis of agent interaction on MoltBook using data collected in early 2026. Grounded in sociological and social-psychological theory, we examine behavior along four dimensions: intent and motivation, norms and templates, incentives and behavioral drift, emotion and contagion.
  Our analysis revealed that agents strongly respond to social rewards and rapidly converge on community-specific interaction templates, resembling human patterns of incentive sensitivity and normative conformity. However, they are predominantly knowledge-driven rather than persona-aligned, and display limited emotional reciprocity along with weak dialogic engagement, which diverges systematically from human online communities.
  Together, these results reveal both similarities and differences between artificial and human social systems and provide an empirical foundation for understanding, designing, and governing large-scale agent communities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin L. Badger</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo E. Gonzalez Penuela, Crescentia Jung, Sharon Y Lin, Ruiying Hu, Shiri Azenkot</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are changing how Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people access visual information in their daily lives. Unlike traditional visual interpretation tools that provide access through captions and OCR (text recognition through camera input), MLLM-enabled applications support access through conversational assistance, where users can ask questions to obtain goal-relevant details. However, evidence about their performance in the real-world and their implications for BLV people's everyday life remain limited. To address this, we conducted a two-week diary study, where we captured 20 BLV participants' use of an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application. Although participants rated the visual interpretations of the application as "somewhat trustworthy" (mean=3.76 out of 5, max=very trustworthy) and "somewhat satisfying" (mean=4.13 out of 5, max=very satisfying), the AI often produced incorrect answers (22.2%) or abstained (10.8%) from responding to follow-up requests. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can improve the accuracy of descriptive visual interpretations, but that supporting everyday use also depends on the "visual assistant" skill -- a set of behaviors for providing goal-directed, reliable assistance. We conclude by proposing the "visual assistant" skill and practical guidelines to help future MLLM-enabled visual interpretation applications better support BLV people's access to visual information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadra Sabouri, Alireza Zolanvari, Sepand Haghighi</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting an optimal classification model requires a robust and comprehensive understanding of the performance of the model. This paper provides a tutorial on the PyCM library, demonstrating its utility in conducting deep-dive evaluations of multi-class classifiers. By examining two different case scenarios, we illustrate how the choice of evaluation metrics can fundamentally shift the interpretation of a model's efficacy. Our findings emphasize that a multi-dimensional evaluation framework is essential for uncovering small but important differences in model performance. However, standard metrics may miss these subtle performance trade-offs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Franco, Lucas M. Tassis, Azalea Rohr, Mark Crovella</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wu, Jia Hu, Geyong Min, Shiqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated low-rank adaptation (FedLoRA) has facilitated communication-efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning of foundation models for downstream tasks. In practical federated learning scenarios, client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions motivates heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients. We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pilot studies (PS) are ubiquitous in HCI research. CHI papers routinely reference 'pilot studies', 'pilot tests', or 'preliminary studies' to justify design decisions, verify procedures, or motivate methodological choices. Yet despite their frequency, the role of pilot studies in HCI remains conceptually vague and empirically underexamined. Unlike fields such as medicine, nursing, and education, where pilot and feasibility studies have well-established definitions, guidelines, reporting standards and even a dedicated research journal, the CHI community lacks a shared understanding of what constitutes a pilot study, why they are conducted, and how they should be reported. Many papers reference pilots 'in passing', without details about design, outcomes, or how the pilot informed the main study. This variability suggests a methodological blind spot in our community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aude Vuilliomenet, Kate E. Jones, Duncan Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: 1. Many ecological decisions are slowed by the gap between collecting and analysing biodiversity data. Edge computing moves processing closer to the sensor, with edge artificial intelligence (AI) enabling on-device inference, reducing reliance on data transfer and continuous connectivity. In principle, this shifts biodiversity monitoring from passive logging towards autonomous, responsive sensing systems. In practice, however, adoption remains fragmented, with key architectural trade-offs, performance constraints, and implementation challenges rarely reported systematically. 2. Here, we analyse 82 studies published between 2017 and 2025 that implement edge computing for biodiversity monitoring across acoustic, vision, tracking, and multi-modal systems. We synthesise hardware platforms, AI model optimisation, and wireless communication to critically assess how design choices shape ecological inference, deployment longevity, and operational feasibility. 3. Publications increased from 3 in 2017 to 19 in 2025. We identify four system types: (I) TinyML, low-power microcontrollers (MCUs) for single-taxon or rare-event detection; (II) Edge AI, single-board computers (SBCs) for multi-species classification and real-time alerts; (III) Distributed edge AI; and (IV) Cloud AI for retrospective processing pipelines. Each system type represents context-dependent trade-offs among power consumption, computational capability, and communication requirements. 4. Our analysis reveals the evolution of edge computing systems from proof-of-concept to robust, scalable tools. We argue that edge computing offers opportunities for responsive biodiversity management, but realising this potential requires increased collaboration between ecologists, engineers, and data scientists to align model development and system design with ecological questions, field constraints, and ethical considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Cheng, Jiucheng Zang, Qingnan Li, Liheng Ma, Yufei Cui, Yingxue Zhang, Boxing Chen, Ming Jian, Wen Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Muon-style optimizers leverage Newton-Schulz (NS) iterations to orthogonalize updates, yielding update geometries that often outperform Adam-series methods. However, this orthogonalization discards magnitude information, rendering training sensitive to step-size hyperparameters and vulnerable to high-energy bursts. To mitigate this, we introduce TrasMuon (\textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}caling \textbf{Muon}). TrasMuon preserves the near-isometric geometry of Muon while stabilizing magnitudes through (i) global RMS calibration and (ii) energy-based trust-region clipping. We demonstrate that while reintroducing adaptive scaling improves optimization efficiency, it typically exacerbates instability due to high-energy outliers. TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ozancan Ozdemir</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid integration of large language models into newsroom workflows has raised urgent questions about the prevalence of AI-generated content in online media. While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to move beyond self-reported journalist perceptions toward empirical, data-driven measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Pedramfar, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing monotone non-convex functions is a fundamental challenge across machine learning and combinatorial optimization. We introduce and study $\gamma$-weakly $\theta$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $\gamma$-weakly $\theta$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $\gamma$, $\theta$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Agarwal, Asim Biswal, Sepanta Zeighami, Alvin Cheung, Joseph Gonzalez, Aditya G. Parameswaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation enables non-expert users to query relational databases through natural language. Recently, NL2SQL agents, powered by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly advanced NL2SQL translation. Nonetheless, NL2SQL agents still make mistakes when faced with large-scale real-world databases because they lack knowledge of how to correctly leverage the underlying data (e.g., knowledge about the intent of each column) and form misconceptions about the data when querying it, leading to errors. Prior work has studied generating facts about the database to provide more context to NL2SQL agents, but such approaches simply restate database contents without addressing the agent's misconceptions. In this paper, we propose Tk-Boost, a bolt-on framework for augmenting any NL2SQL agent with tribal knowledge: knowledge that corrects the agent's misconceptions in querying the database accumulated through experience using the database. To accumulate experience, Tk-Boost first asks the NL2SQL agent to answer a few queries on the database, identifies the agent's misconceptions by analyzing its mistakes on the database, and generates tribal knowledge to address them. To enable accurate retrieval, Tk-Boost indexes this knowledge with applicability conditions that specify the query features for which the knowledge is useful. When answering new queries, Tk-Boost uses this knowledge to provide feedback to the NL2SQL agent, resolving the agent's misconceptions during SQL generation, and thus improving the agent's accuracy. Extensive experiments across the BIRD and Spider 2.0 benchmarks with various NL2SQL agents shows Tk-Boost improves NL2SQL agents accuracy by up to 16.9% on Spider 2.0 and 13.7% on BIRD</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Franco, Carson Loughridge, Mark Crovella</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sin-Han Yang, Cheng-Kuang Wu, Chieh-Yen Lin, Yun-Nung Chen, Hung-yi Lee, Shao-Hua Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose problem solvers, making accurate confidence estimation critical for reliable use. Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiming Song, Xuan Xie, Ruiping Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that elicit harmful or policy-violating outputs, while many existing defenses rely on expensive fine-tuning, intrusive prompt rewriting, or external guardrails that add latency and can degrade helpfulness. We present AISA, a lightweight, single-pass defense that activates safety behaviors already latent inside the model rather than treating safety as an add-on. AISA first localizes intrinsic safety awareness via spatiotemporal analysis and shows that intent-discriminative signals are broadly encoded, with especially strong separability appearing in the scaled dot-product outputs of specific attention heads near the final structural tokens before generation. Using a compact set of automatically selected heads, AISA extracts an interpretable prompt-risk score with minimal overhead, achieving detector-level performance competitive with strong proprietary baselines on small (7B) models. AISA then performs logits-level steering: it modulates the decoding distribution in proportion to the inferred risk, ranging from normal generation for benign prompts to calibrated refusal for high-risk requests -- without changing model parameters, adding auxiliary modules, or requiring multi-pass inference. Extensive experiments spanning 13 datasets, 12 LLMs, and 14 baselines demonstrate that AISA improves robustness and transfer while preserving utility and reducing false refusals, enabling safer deployment even for weakly aligned or intentionally risky model variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Wang, Lingling Li, Marcus Santos, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Discernment, a semantic communication system that transmits the meaning of physical signals (baseband radio and audio) over a technical channel using GenAI models operating in discrete spaces. Discernment dynamically adapts to channel impairments - modeled as erasure channels - by switching between an autoregressive or a diffusion-based generative algorithm, depending on the erasure pattern. Our results show that Discernment maintains semantic integrity even as channel capacity severely degrades, exhibiting very small and graceful performance decline in both classification accuracy and statistical fidelity of the reconstructed meaning. These findings demonstrate Discernment's ability to adjust to diverse physical channel conditions while maintaining spectral efficiency and low model complexity, making it well suited for IoT deployments and strongly motivating further research on this semantic channel paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbo Wang, Minzheng Wang, Jian Liang, Lu Wang, Yongcan Yu, Ran He</p>
<p>Abstract: While reasoning models have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, their increasing power necessitates stringent safety measures. For safety alignment, the core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off between safety and utility. However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning. Furthermore, to counteract the preference for rule consultation during RL, we introduce Inverse Frequency Policy Optimization (IFPO) to rebalance advantage estimates. By decoupling rule retrieval and subsequent reasoning, our method achieves higher overall performance compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Song, Xiangyu Kong, Xinrui Bao, Yizhi Zhou, Jiulong Jiao, Sitong Liu, Yuhang Zhou, Heng Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks remain a critical challenge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current alignment methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on compressing vast amounts of human preference data into static, absolute reward functions, leading to data scarcity, noise sensitivity, and training instability. We introduce Elo-Evolve, a co-evolutionary framework that redefines alignment as dynamic multi-agent competition within an adaptive opponent pool. Our approach makes two key innovations: (1) eliminating Bradley-Terry model dependencies by learning directly from binary win/loss outcomes in pairwise competitions, and (2) implementing Elo-orchestrated opponent selection that provides automatic curriculum learning through temperature-controlled sampling. We ground our approach in PAC learning theory, demonstrating that pairwise comparison achieves superior sample complexity and empirically validate a 4.5x noise reduction compared to absolute scoring approaches. Experimentally, we train a Qwen2.5-7B model using our framework with opponents including Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Qwen3-8B models. Results demonstrate a clear performance hierarchy: point-based methods < static pairwise training < Elo-Evolve across Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench, validating the progressive benefits of pairwise comparison and dynamic opponent selection for LLM alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruomeng Ding, Yifei Pang, He Sun, Yizhong Wang, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Zhun Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system, which operates on two parallel yet interactive streams for contextual and spatial understanding, this article presents Two Interactive Streams (TwInS), a novel bio-inspired joint learning framework capable of simultaneously performing scene parsing and geometric vision tasks. TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<p>Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, utilizing beamforming techniques to address the inherent path loss limitation, is considered as one of the key technologies to support ever increasing high throughput and low latency demands of connected vehicles. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13611">From What to How: Bridging User Requirements with Software Development Using Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao He, Ru Chen, Jialun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) are extensively utilized to enhance development efficiency, leading to numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans. Our research highlights the current limitations of LLMs in managing software design and calls for further investigation into new design methodologies and languages suitable for LLM-based development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuele Reani, Xiangyang He, Zuolan Bao</p>
<p>Abstract: Anthropomorphic design is routinely used to make conversational agents more approachable and engaging. Yet its influence on users' perceptions remains poorly understood. Drawing on psychological theories, we propose that anthropomorphism influences risk perception via two complementary forms of trust, and that domain knowledge moderates these relationships. To test our model, we conducted a large-scale online experiment (N = 1,256) on a financial decision-support system implementing different anthropomorphic designs. We found that anthropomorphism indirectly reduces risk perception by increasing both cognitive and affective trust. Domain knowledge moderates these paths: participants with low financial knowledge experience a negative indirect effect of perceived anthropomorphism on risk perception via cognitive trust, whereas those with high financial knowledge exhibit a positive direct and indirect effect. We discuss theoretical contributions to human-AI interaction and design implications for calibrating trust in anthropomorphic decision-support systems for responsible AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Li, Jiani Lu, Yu Song, Xianren Li, Bo An, Peng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing robotic manipulation methods primarily rely on visual and proprioceptive observations, which may struggle to infer contact-related interaction states in partially observable real-world environments. Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yu, Tianyi Wang, Ruixia Liu, Yinglong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly applied to question-answering over long academic papers, where accurate evidence allocation under a fixed token budget is critical. Existing approaches typically flatten academic papers into unstructured chunks during preprocessing, which destroys the native hierarchical structure. This loss forces retrieval to operate in a disordered space, thereby producing fragmented contexts, misallocating tokens to non-evidential regions under finite token budgets, and increasing the reasoning burden for downstream language models. To address these issues, we propose PT-RAG, an RAG framework that treats the native hierarchical structure of academic papers as a low-entropy retrieval prior. PT-RAG first inherits the native hierarchy to construct a structure-fidelity PaperTree index, which prevents entropy increase at the source. It then designs a path-guided retrieval mechanism that aligns query semantics to relevant sections and selects high relevance root-to-leaf paths under a fixed token budget, yielding compact, coherent, and low-entropy retrieval contexts. In contrast to existing RAG approaches, PT-RAG avoids entropy increase caused by destructive preprocessing and provides a native low-entropy structural basis for subsequent retrieval. To assess this design, we introduce entropy-based structural diagnostics that quantify retrieval fragmentation and evidence allocation accuracy. On three academic question-answering benchmarks, PT-RAG achieves consistently lower section entropy and evidence alignment cross entropy than strong baselines, indicating reduced context fragmentation and more precise allocation to evidential regions. These structural advantages directly translate into higher answer quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byungjin Choi, Seongsu Bae, Sunjun Kweon, Edward Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce KorMedMCQA-V, a Korean medical licensing-exam-style multimodal multiple-choice question answering benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities. By complementing the text-only KorMedMCQA benchmark, KorMedMCQA-V forms a unified evaluation suite for Korean medical reasoning across text-only and multimodal conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Behfar, Richard Mortier</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world federated learning (FL) systems, client participation is intermittent, heterogeneous, and often correlated with data characteristics or resource constraints. Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khang Nguyen Quoc, Phuong D. Dao, Luyl-Da Quach</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward Chen, Natalie Dullerud, Pang Wei Koh, Thomas Niedermayr, Elizabeth Kidd, Sanmi Koyejo, Carlos Guestrin</p>
<p>Abstract: In complex clinical decision-making, clinicians must often track a variety of competing metrics defined by aim (ideal) and limit (strict) thresholds. Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, existing works often rely on manual designs or "one-size-fits-all" automation, lacking dynamic adaptability after deployment. Inspired by how biological systems adapt, we introduce MASFly, a novel multi-agent framework enabling dynamic adaptation at test time. To adapt system generation, MASFly employs a retrieval-augmented SOP instantiation mechanism that leverages a self-constructed repository of successful collaboration patterns, enabling the LLM to assemble customized MASs for new queries. For adaptive execution, MASFly incorporates an experience-guided supervision mechanism, where a dedicated Watcher agent monitors system behaviors with reference to a personalized experience pool and provides real-time interventions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASFly achieves state-of-the-art performance, most notably a 61.7% success rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, while exhibiting strong task adaptability and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Wang, Yifan Zhang, Brian Y. Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Explainable AI (XAI) focuses on explaining a single application, but when encountering related applications, users may rely on their prior understanding from previous explanations. This leads to either overgeneralization and AI overreliance, or burdensome independent memorization. Indeed, related decision tasks can share explanatory factors, but with some notable differences; e.g., body mass index (BMI) affects the risks for heart disease and diabetes at the same rate, but chest pain is more indicative of heart disease. Similarly, models using different attributes for the same task still share signals; e.g., temperature and pressure affect air pollution but in opposite directions due to the ideal gas law. Leveraging transfer of learning, we propose Transferable XAI to enable users to transfer understanding across related domains by explaining the relationship between domain explanations using a general affine transformation framework applied to linear factor explanations. The framework supports explanation transfer across various domain types: translation for data subspace (subsuming prior work on Incremental XAI), scaling for decision task, and mapping for attributes. Focusing on task and attributes domain types, in formative and summative user studies, we investigated how well participants could understand AI decisions from one domain to another. Compared to single-domain and domain-independent explanations, Transferable XAI was the most helpful for understanding the second domain, leading to the best decision faithfulness, factor recall, and ability to relate explanations between domains. This framework contributes to improving the reusability of explanations across related AI applications by explaining factor relationships between subspaces, tasks, and attributes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maimoona Jafar, Syed Imran Ali, Ahsan Saadat, Muhammad Bilal, Shah Khalid</p>
<p>Abstract: Environmental pollution is a critical global issue, with recycling emerging as one of the most viable solutions. This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Correlation Clustering (CC) is a fundamental unsupervised learning primitive whose strongest LP-based approximation guarantees require $\Theta(n^3)$ triangle inequality constraints and are prohibitive at scale. We initiate the study of \emph{sparsification--approximation trade-offs} for CC, asking how much edge information is needed to retain LP-based guarantees. We establish a structural dichotomy between pseudometric and general weighted instances. On the positive side, we prove that the VC dimension of the clustering disagreement class is exactly $n{-}1$, yielding additive $\varepsilon$-coresets of optimal size $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$; that at most $\binom{n}{2}$ triangle inequalities are active at any LP vertex, enabling an exact cutting-plane solver; and that a sparsified variant of LP-PIVOT, which imputes missing LP marginals via triangle inequalities, achieves a robust $\frac{10}{3}$-approximation (up to an additive term controlled by an empirically computable imputation-quality statistic $\overline{\Gamma}_w$) once $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{3/2})$ edges are observed, a threshold we prove is sharp. On the negative side, we show via Yao's minimax principle that without pseudometric structure, any algorithm observing $o(n)$ uniformly random edges incurs an unbounded approximation ratio, demonstrating that the pseudometric condition governs not only tractability but also the robustness of CC to incomplete information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siqian Tong, Xuan Li, Yiwei Wang, Baolong Bi, Yujun Cai, Shenghua Liu, Yuchen He, Chengpeng Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) excel at perception but struggle with complex reasoning requiring precise acoustic measurements. While external tools can extract fine-grained features like exact tempo or pitch, effective integration remains challenging: naively using all tools causes information overload, while prompt-based selection fails to assess context-dependent utility. To address this, we propose AuTAgent (Audio Tool Agent), a reinforcement learning framework that learns when and which tools to invoke. By employing a sparse-feedback training strategy with a novel Differential Reward mechanism, the agent learns to filter out irrelevant tools and invokes external assistance only when it yields a net performance gain over the base model. Experimental results confirm that AuTAgent complements the representation bottleneck of LALMs by providing verifiable acoustic evidence. It improves accuracy by 4.20% / 6.20% and 9.80% / 8.00% for open-source and closed-source backbones on the MMAU Test-mini and the MMAR benchmarks, respectively. In addition, further experiments demonstrate exceptional transferability. We highlight the complementary role of external tools in augmenting audio model reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we presented Pailitao-VL, a comprehensive multi-modal retrieval system engineered for high-precision, real-time industrial search. We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods. Extensive offline benchmarks and online A/B tests on Alibaba e-commerce platform confirm that Pailitao-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers substantial business impact. This work demonstrates a robust and scalable path for deploying advanced MLLM-based retrieval architectures in demanding, large-scale production environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Limited by inference latency, existing robot manipulation policies lack sufficient real-time interaction capability with the environment. Although faster generation methods such as flow matching are gradually replacing diffusion methods, researchers are pursuing even faster generation suitable for interactive robot control. MeanFlow, as a one-step variant of flow matching, has shown strong potential in image generation, but its precision in action generation does not meet the stringent requirements of robotic manipulation. We therefore propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a \textbf{3-stage method} with \textbf{2-NFE}: Global Jump in MeanFlow mode, ReNoise for distribution alignment, and Local Refine in ReFlow mode. This method balances inference speed and generation quality by leveraging the rapid advantage of MeanFlow one-step generation while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps. Through real-world experiments, HybridFlow outperforms the 16-step Diffusion Policy by \textbf{15--25\%} in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (\textbf{8$\times$ speedup}, \textbf{$\sim$52Hz}); it also achieves 70.0\% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3\% on deformable object folding. We envision HybridFlow as a practical low-latency method to enhance real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models demonstrate strong performance on natural image understanding, yet exhibit limited capability in interpreting scientific images, including but not limited to schematic diagrams, experimental characterizations, and analytical charts. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-source MLLMs. The gap largely stems from existing datasets with limited domain coverage, coarse structural annotations, and weak semantic grounding. We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Zhi, Wentao Tan, Lei Zhu, Fengling Li, Jingjing Li, Guoli Yang, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Tianle Ren, Fei Wang, Brian Y Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining with examples is an intuitive way to justify AI decisions. However, it is challenging to understand how a decision value should change relative to the examples with many features differing by large amounts. We draw from real estate valuation that uses Comparables-examples with known values for comparison. Estimates are made more accurate by hypothetically adjusting the attributes of each Comparable and correspondingly changing the value based on factors. We propose Comparables XAI for relatable example-based explanations of AI with Trace adjustments that trace counterfactual changes from each Comparable to the Subject, one attribute at a time, monotonically along the AI feature space. In modelling and user studies, Trace-adjusted Comparables achieved the highest XAI faithfulness and precision, user accuracy, and narrowest uncertainty bounds compared to linear regression, linearly adjusted Comparables, or unadjusted Comparables. This work contributes a new analytical basis for using example-based explanations to improve user understanding of AI decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Boubnovski Martell, Josefa Lia Stoisser, Lawrence Phillips, Aditya Misra, Robert Kitchen, Jesper Ferkinghoff-Borg, Jialin Yu, Philip Torr, Kaspar M\"arten</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to unseen genetic perturbations is essential for understanding gene regulation and prioritizing large-scale perturbation experiments. Existing approaches either rely on static, potentially incomplete knowledge graphs, or prompt language models for functionally similar genes, retrieving associations shaped by symmetric co-occurrence in scientific text rather than directed regulatory logic. We introduce MechPert, a lightweight framework that encourages LLM agents to generate directed regulatory hypotheses rather than relying solely on functional similarity. Multiple agents independently propose candidate regulators with associated confidence scores; these are aggregated through a consensus mechanism that filters spurious associations, producing weighted neighborhoods for downstream prediction. We evaluate MechPert on Perturb-seq benchmarks across four human cell lines. For perturbation prediction in low-data regimes ($N=50$ observed perturbations), MechPert improves Pearson correlation by up to 10.5\% over similarity-based baselines. For experimental design, MechPert-selected anchor genes outperform standard network centrality heuristics by up to 46\% in well-characterized cell lines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojian Zhan, Letian Tao, Pengcheng Wang, Yixiao Wang, Yiheng Li, Yuxin Chen, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Shengbo Eben Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning expressive and efficient policy functions is a promising direction in reinforcement learning (RL). While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness. Empirically, our MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks from Robomimic and OGBench. It also delivers substantial improvements in training and inference speed over existing flow-based policy baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Guo, Zhuoran Du, Nan Tang, Kezheng Tang, Congcong Ge, Yunjun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Document-to-table (Doc2Table) extraction derives structured tables from unstructured documents under a target schema, enabling reliable and verifiable SQL-based data analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in flexible information extraction, their ability to produce precisely structured tables remains insufficiently understood, particularly for indirect extraction that requires complex capabilities such as reasoning and conflict resolution. Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction.We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables. Based on this approach, we present DTBench, a synthetic benchmark that adopts a proposed two-level taxonomy of Doc2Table capabilities, covering 5 major categories and 13 subcategories. We evaluate several mainstream LLMs on DTBench, and demonstrate substantial performance gaps across models, as well as persistent challenges in reasoning, faithfulness, and conflict resolution. DTBench provides a comprehensive testbed for data generation and evaluation, facilitating future research on Doc2Table extraction. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-DAILY/DTBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Carrasco-Pollo, Floor Eijkelboom, Jan-Willem van de Meent</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Pawsterior, a variational flow-matching framework for improved and extended simulation-based inference (SBI). Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI is reshaping academic research, yet its role in peer review remains polarising and contentious. Advocates see its potential to reduce reviewer burden and improve quality, while critics warn of risks to fairness, accountability, and trust. At ICLR 2025, an official AI feedback tool was deployed to provide reviewers with post-review suggestions. We studied this deployment through surveys and interviews, investigating how reviewers engaged with the tool and perceived its usability and impact. Our findings surface both opportunities and tensions when AI augments in peer review. This work contributes the first empirical evidence of such an AI tool in a live review process, documenting how reviewers respond to AI-generated feedback in a high-stakes review context. We further offer design implications for AI-assisted reviewing that aim to enhance quality while safeguarding human expertise, agency, and responsibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a common and life-threatening condition in elderly patients, often treated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Despite procedural advances, paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVR) remains one of the most frequent post-TAVI complications, with a proven impact on long-term prognosis.
  In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the occurrence of PVR from preoperative cardiac CT. To this end, a dataset of preoperative TAVI patients was collected, and 3D convolutional neural networks were trained on isotropic CT volumes. The results achieved suggest that volumetric deep learning can capture subtle anatomical features from pre-TAVI imaging, opening new perspectives for personalized risk assessment and procedural optimization.

<p>Abstract: Formal specifications are crucial for building verifiable and dependable software systems, yet generating accurate and verifiable specifications for real-world C programs remains challenging. This paper empirically evaluates the extent to which formal-analysis tools can automatically generate and verify ACSL specifications without human or learning-based assistance. We conduct a controlled study on a recently released dataset of 506 C programs, repurposing it from interactive, developer-driven workflows to an automated evaluation setting. Five ACSL generation systems are compared: a rule-based Python script, Frama-C's RTE plugin, and three large language models--DeepSeek-V3.2, GPT-5.2, and OLMo 3.1 32B Instruct. All generated specifications are verified under identical conditions using the Frama-C WP plugin powered by multiple SMT solvers, allowing a direct comparison of annotation quality, solver sensitivity, and proof stability. Our results provide new empirical evidence on the capabilities and limitations of automated ACSL generation, complementing prior survey-based work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in speech language models, such as GPT-4o Voice Mode and Gemini Live, have demonstrated promising speech generation capabilities. Nevertheless, the aesthetic naturalness of the synthesized audio still lags behind that of human speech. Enhancing generation quality requires a reliable evaluator of speech naturalness. However, existing naturalness evaluators typically regress raw audio to scalar scores, offering limited interpretability of the evaluation and moreover fail to generalize to speech across different taxonomies. Inspired by recent advances in generative reward modeling, we propose the Generative Speech Reward Model (GSRM), a reasoning-centric reward model tailored for speech. The GSRM is trained to decompose speech naturalness evaluation into an interpretable acoustic feature extraction stage followed by feature-grounded chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling explainable judgments. To achieve this, we curated a large-scale human feedback dataset comprising 31k expert ratings and an out-of-domain benchmark of real-world user-assistant speech interactions. Experiments show that GSRM substantially outperforms existing speech naturalness predictors, achieving model-human correlation of naturalness score prediction that approaches human inter-rater consistency. We further show how GSRM can improve the naturalness of speech LLM generations by serving as an effective verifier for online RLHF.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose RPGD (RANSAC-P3P Gradient Descent), a human-pose-driven extrinsic calibration framework that robustly aligns MoCap-based 3D skeletal data with monocular or multi-view RGB cameras using only natural human motion. RPGD formulates extrinsic calibration as a coarse-to-fine problem tailored to human poses, combining the global robustness of RANSAC-P3P with Gradient-Descent-based refinement. We evaluate RPGD on three large-scale public 3D HPE datasets as well as on a self-collected in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that RPGD consistently recovers extrinsic parameters with accuracy comparable to the provided ground truth, achieving sub-pixel MPJPE reprojection error even in challenging, noisy settings. These results indicate that RPGD provides a practical and automatic solution for reliable extrinsic calibration of large-scale 3D HPE dataset collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ouns El Harzli, Yoonsoo Nam, Ilja Kuzborskij, Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Ard A. Louis</p>
<p>Abstract: Algorithmic stability is a classical framework for analyzing the generalization error of learning algorithms. It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in agent-mediated systems have enabled a new paradigm of social network simulation, where AI agents interact with human-like autonomy. This evolution has fostered the emergence of agent-driven social networks such as Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform populated entirely by AI agents. Despite these developments, empirical comparisons between agent-driven and human-driven social networks remain scarce, limiting our understanding of how their network topologies might diverge. This paper presents the first comparative analysis of network topology on Moltbook, utilizing a comment network comprising 33,577 nodes and 697,688 edges. To provide a benchmark, we curated a parallel dataset from Reddit consisting of 7.8 million nodes and 51.8 million edges. We examine key structural differences between agent-drive and human-drive networks, specifically focusing on topological patterns and the edge formation efficacy of their respective posts. Our findings provide a foundational profile of AI-driven social structures, serving as a preliminary step toward developing more robust and authentic agent-mediated social systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Repository-level bug localization-the task of identifying where code must be modified to fix a bug-is a critical software engineering challenge. Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for bug localization and established GREPO as a foundation resource for future research, The code is available at https://github.com/qingpingmo/GREPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adolfo Gonz\'alez, V\'ictor Parada</p>
<p>Abstract: Business environments characterized by structural demand intermittency, high variability, and multi-step planning horizons require robust and reproducible model selection mechanisms. Empirical evidence shows that no forecasting model is universally dominant and that relative rankings vary across error metrics, demand regimes, and forecast horizons, generating ambiguity in multi-SKU decision contexts. This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tokenization is a hardcoded compression step which remains in the training pipeline of Large Language Models (LLMs), despite a general trend towards architectures becoming increasingly end-to-end. Prior work has shown promising results at scale in bringing this compression step inside the LLMs' architecture with heuristics to draw token boundaries, and also attempts to learn these token boundaries with straight-through estimates, which treat the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries as a continuous one. We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable. We demonstrate that the resultant method outperforms prior proposed straight-through estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively at the $100$ million parameter scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiwei Shi, Sihao Chen, Bowen Jiang, Linxin Song, Longqi Yang, Jieyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the central approach for language models (LMs) to learn from environmental reward or feedback. In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Eureka-Audio, a compact yet high-performance audio language model that achieves competitive performance against models that are 4 to 18 times larger across a broad range of audio understanding benchmarks. Despite containing only 1.7B parameters, Eureka-Audio demonstrates strong performance on automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio understanding, and dense audio captioning, matching or surpassing multiple 7B to 30B audio and omni-modal baselines. The model adopts a unified end-to-end architecture composed of a lightweight language backbone, a Whisper-based audio encoder, and a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) adapter that explicitly accounts for audio heterogeneity and alleviates cross-modal optimization conflicts under limited capacity. To further enhance paralinguistic reasoning, we introduce DataFlux, a closed loop audio instruction data synthesis and verification pipeline that constructs high quality, logically consistent supervision from raw audio. Extensive evaluations across ASR, knowledge reasoning, safety, instruction following, and paralinguistic benchmarks, demonstrate that Eureka-Audio achieves an efficient balance between computational cost and performance. These results establish Eureka Audio as a strong and practical baseline for lightweight audio understanding models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models are widely used in chemistry for molecular property prediction and small-molecule generation, yet Natural Products (NPs) remain underexplored despite their importance in drug discovery. To address this gap, we develop NP-specific chemical language models (NPCLMs) by pre-training state-space models (Mamba and Mamba-2) and comparing them with transformer baselines (GPT). Using a dataset of about 1M NPs, we present the first systematic comparison of selective state-space models and transformers for NP-focused tasks, together with eight tokenization strategies including character-level, Atom-in-SMILES (AIS), byte-pair encoding (BPE), and NP-specific BPE. We evaluate molecule generation (validity, uniqueness, novelty) and property prediction (membrane permeability, taste, anti-cancer activity) using MCC and AUC-ROC. Mamba generates 1-2 percent more valid and unique molecules than Mamba-2 and GPT, with fewer long-range dependency errors, while GPT yields slightly more novel structures. For property prediction, Mamba variants outperform GPT by 0.02-0.04 MCC under random splits, while scaffold splits show comparable performance. Results demonstrate that domain-specific pre-training on about 1M NPs can match models trained on datasets over 100 times larger.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential for personalizing e-commerce shopping experiences. Among these, Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR) has emerged as a key scenario, which utilizes a trigger item (explicitly represents a user's instantaneous interest), enabling precise, real-time recommendations. Although several trigger-based techniques have been proposed, most of them struggle to address the intent myopia issue, that is, a recommendation system overemphasizes the role of trigger items and narrowly focuses on suggesting commodities that are highly relevant to trigger items. Meanwhile, existing methods rely on collaborative behavior patterns between trigger and recommended items to identify the user's preferences, yet the sparsity of ID-based interaction restricts their effectiveness. To this end, we propose the Deep Adaptive Intent-Aware Network (DAIAN) that dynamically adapts to users' intent preferences. In general, we first extract the users' personalized intent representations by analyzing the correlation between a user's click and the trigger item, and accordingly retrieve the user's related historical behaviors to mine the user's diverse intent. Besides, sparse collaborative behaviors constrain the performance in capturing items associated with user intent. Hence, we reinforce similarity by leveraging a hybrid enhancer with ID and semantic information, followed by adaptive selection based on varying intents. Experimental results on public datasets and our industrial e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAIAN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Zahedzadeh, Behnam Bahrak</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models increasingly rely on self-explanations, such as chain of thought reasoning, to improve performance on multi step question answering. While these explanations enhance accuracy, they are often verbose and costly to generate, raising the question of how much explanation is truly necessary. In this paper, we examine the trade-off between sufficiency, defined as the ability of an explanation to justify the correct answer, and conciseness, defined as the reduction in explanation length. Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srikumar Nayak</p>
<p>Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) has emerged as a critical component in automating financial transaction processing, particularly in extracting structured information from unstructured payment data. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art NER algorithms specifically designed for payment data extraction, including Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with CRF (BiLSTM-CRF), and transformer-based models such as BERT and FinBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of 50,000 annotated payment transactions across multiple payment formats including SWIFT MT103, ISO 20022, and domestic payment systems. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned BERT models achieve an F1-score of 94.2% for entity extraction, outperforming traditional CRF-based approaches by 12.8 percentage points. Furthermore, we introduce PaymentBERT, a novel hybrid architecture combining domain-specific financial embeddings with contextual representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 95.7% F1-score while maintaining real-time processing capabilities. We provide detailed analysis of cross-format generalization, ablation studies, and deployment considerations. This research provides practical insights for financial institutions implementing automated sanctions screening, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and payment processing systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have enabled robust generalization in computational pathology through large-scale datasets and expansive architectures, but their substantial computational cost, particularly for gigapixel whole slide images, limits clinical accessibility and scalability. Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youpeng Li, Fuxun Yu, Xinda Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of LLMs into vulnerability detection (VD) has shifted the field toward interpretable and context-aware analysis. While post-training methods have shown promise in general coding tasks, their systematic application to VD remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the post-training pipeline for LLM-based VD, spanning from cold-start SFT to off-policy preference optimization and on-policy RL, uncovering how data curation, stage interactions, reward mechanisms, and evaluation protocols collectively dictate the efficacy of model training and assessment. Our study identifies practical guidelines and insights: (1) SFT based on rejection sampling greatly outperforms rationalization-based supervision, which can introduce hallucinations due to ground-truth leakage. (2) While increased SFT epochs constantly benefit preference optimization, excessive SFT inhibits self-exploration during RL, ultimately limiting performance gains. (3) Coarse-grained reward signals often mislead RL, whereas fine-grained root-cause judgments ensure reliable credit assignment. Specification-based rewards offer further benefits but incur significant effort in specification generation. (4) Although filtering extremely hard-to-detect vulnerability samples improves RL training efficiency, the cost of performance loss should be considered in practical applications. (5) Models trained under GRPO significantly outperform those using SFT and preference optimization (i.e., DPO and ORPO), as well as a series of zero-shot SOTA LLMs, underscoring the significant potential of on-policy RL for LLM-based VD. (6) In contrast to binary matching that tends to overestimate performance, LLM-as-a-Judge based on root-cause analysis provides a more robust evaluation protocol, although its accuracy varies across judge models with different levels of security expertise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinxing Zhou, Qingren Yao, Yiji Zhao, Chenghao Liu, Flora Salim, Xiaojie Yuan, Yanlong Wen, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Most time series foundation models are pretrained by directly predicting future observations, which often yields weakly structured latent representations that capture surface noise rather than coherent and predictable temporal dynamics. In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results demonstrate that constraining models to learn predictable latent dynamics is a principled step toward more robust and reliable time series foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuang Ai, Jiaming Han, Shaobin Zhuang, Weijia Mao, Xuefeng Hu, Ziyan Yang, Zhenheng Yang, Huaibo Huang, Xiangyu Yue, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present BitDance, a scalable autoregressive (AR) image generator that predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices. With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Guan, Rongyuan Wu, Shuai Li, Wentao Zhu, Wenjun Zeng, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14043">Beyond Static Snapshots: Dynamic Modeling and Forecasting of Group-Level Value Evolution with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiankun Pi, Guixin Su, Jinliang Li, Mayi Xu, Xin Miao, Jiawei Jiang, Ming Zhong, Tieyun Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Social simulation is critical for mining complex social dynamics and supporting data-driven decision making. LLM-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for this task by leveraging human-like social questionnaire responses to model group behaviors. Existing LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on group-level values at discrete time points, treating them as static snapshots rather than dynamic processes. However, group-level values are not fixed but shaped by long-term social changes. Modeling their dynamics is thus crucial for accurate social evolution prediction--a key challenge in both data mining and social science. This problem remains underexplored due to limited longitudinal data, group heterogeneity, and intricate historical event impacts.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for group-level dynamic social simulation by integrating historical value trajectories into LLM-based human response modeling. We select China and the U.S. as representative contexts, conducting stratified simulations across four core sociodemographic dimensions (gender, age, education, income). Using the World Values Survey, we construct a multi-wave, group-level longitudinal dataset to capture historical value evolution, and then propose the first event-based prediction method for this task, unifying social events, current value states, and group attributes into a single framework. Evaluations across five LLM families show substantial gains: a maximum 30.88\% improvement on seen questions and 33.97\% on unseen questions over the Vanilla baseline. We further find notable cross-group heterogeneity: U.S. groups are more volatile than Chinese groups, and younger groups in both countries are more sensitive to external changes. These findings advance LLM-based social simulation and provide new insights for social scientists to understand and predict social value changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Wang, Areg Karapetyan, Djellel Difallah, Samer Madanat</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is a core component of intelligent transportation systems, supporting various downstream tasks such as signal control and network-level traffic management. In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

<p>Abstract: Most vision-language models (VLMs) are trained on English-centric data, limiting their performance in other languages and cultural contexts. This restricts their usability for non-English-speaking users and hinders the development of multimodal systems that reflect diverse linguistic and cultural realities. In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaqian Zhang, Bernhard Pfahringer, Eibe Frank, Albert Bifet</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their success, large pretrained vision models remain vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks in class-incremental settings. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nitay Calderon, Eyal Ben-David, Zorik Gekhman, Eran Ofek, Gal Yona</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizhao Luo, Zhaojing Luo, Meihui Zhang, Rui Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language table reasoning, where there are two main categories of methods. Prompt-based approaches rely on language-only inference or one-pass program generation without step-level verification. Agent-based approaches use tools in a closed loop, but verification is often local and backtracking is limited, allowing errors to propagate and increasing cost. Moreover, they rely on chain- or beam-style trajectories that are typically combinatorially redundant, leading to high token costs. In this paper, we propose TabTracer, an agentic framework that coordinates multi-step tool calls over intermediate table states, with explicit state tracking for verification and rollback. First, it enforces step-level verification with typed operations and lightweight numeric and format checks to provide reliable rewards and suppress hallucinations. Second, execution-feedback Monte Carlo Tree Search maintains a search tree of candidate table states and uses backpropagated reflection scores to guide UCB1 selection and rollback via versioned snapshots. Third, it reduces redundancy with budget-aware pruning, deduplication, and state hashing with a monotonicity gate to cut token cost. Comprehensive evaluation on TabFact, WikiTQ, and CRT datasets shows that TabTracer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 6.7% in accuracy while reducing token consumption by 59--84%.</p>

We present SemanticFeels, an extension of the NeuralFeels framework that integrates semantic labeling with neural implicit shape representation, from vision and touch. To illustrate its application, we focus on material classification: high-resolution Digit tactile readings are processed by a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate local material predictions, which are then embedded into an augmented signed distance field (SDF) network that jointly predicts geometry and continuous material regions. Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.</p>

<p>Abstract: The most valuable asset of any cloud-based organization is data, which is increasingly exposed to sophisticated cyberattacks. Until recently, the implementation of security measures in DevOps environments was often considered optional by many government entities and critical national services operating in the cloud. This includes systems managing sensitive information, such as electoral processes or military operations, which have historically been valuable targets for cybercriminals. Resistance to security implementation is often driven by concerns over losing agility in software development, increasing the risk of accumulated vulnerabilities. Nowadays, patching software is no longer enough; adopting a proactive cyber defense strategy, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is crucial to anticipating and mitigating threats. Thus, this work proposes integrating the Security Chaos Engineering (SCE) methodology with a new LLM-based flow to automate the creation of attack defense trees that represent adversary behavior and facilitate the construction of SCE experiments based on these graphical models, enabling teams to stay one step ahead of attackers and implement previously unconsidered defenses.

Multiple control loops coexist across the service management layer and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), while independently developed control applications can interact in unintended ways. In parallel, recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling a shift from isolated AI models toward agentic AI systems that can interpret goals, coordinate multiple models and control functions, and adapt their behavior over time. This article proposes a multi-scale agentic AI framework for O-RAN that organizes RAN intelligence as a coordinated hierarchy across the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT), Near-Real-Time (Near-RT), and Real-Time (RT) control loops: (i) A Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the Non-RT RIC translates operator intent into policies and governs model lifecycles. (ii) Small Language Model (SLM) agents in the Near-RT RIC execute low-latency optimization and can activate, tune, or disable existing control applications; and (iii) Wireless Physical-layer Foundation Model (WPFM) agents near the distributed unit provide fast inference close to the air interface. We describe how these agents cooperate through standardized O-RAN interfaces and telemetry. Using a proof-of-concept implementation built on open-source models, software, and datasets, we demonstrate the proposed agentic approach in two representative scenarios: robust operation under non-stationary conditions and intent-driven slice resource control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Li, Hongze Shen, Lexiang Tang, Xin Li, Xinpeng Ding, Yinsong Liu, Deqiang Jiang, Xing Sun, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in high-level visual understanding. However, extending these models to fine-grained dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, typically necessitates the incorporation of complex, task-specific decoders and other customizations. This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixuan Fang, Yuzhen Lu, Xinyang Mu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional mechanized chestnut harvesting is too costly for small producers, non-selective, and prone to damaging nuts. Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment.

<p>Abstract: Text-driven image and video editing can be naturally cast as inpainting problems, where masked regions are reconstructed to remain consistent with both the observed content and the editing prompt. Recent advances in test-time guidance for diffusion and flow models provide a principled framework for this task; however, existing methods rely on costly vector--Jacobian product (VJP) computations to approximate the intractable guidance term, limiting their practical applicability. Building upon the recent work of Moufad et al. (2025), we provide theoretical insights into their VJP-free approximation and substantially extend their empirical evaluation to large-scale image and video editing benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that test-time guidance alone can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases surpass, training-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naeimeh Nourmohammadi, Md Meem Hossain, The Anh Han, Safina Showkat Ara, Zia Ush Shamszaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for healthcare question answering, but clinical use is limited by weak verification, insufficient evidence grounding, and unreliable confidence signalling. We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Guo, Zhongjian Qiao, Yingqi Xie, Jie Liu, Dan Ye, Ruiqing Zhang, Shuang Qiu, Lijie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective exploration is a key challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models: discovering high-quality trajectories within a limited sampling budget from the vast natural language sequence space. Existing methods face notable limitations: GRPO samples exclusively from the root, saturating high-probability trajectories while leaving deep, error-prone states under-explored. Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO, tree-based methods, and other strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Hemker, Andrew H. Song, Cristina Almagro-P\'erez, Guillaume Jaume, Sophia J. Wagner, Anurag Vaidya, Nikola Simidjievski, Mateja Jamnik, Faisal Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the significant expansion of the context window in Large Language Models (LLMs), these models are theoretically capable of processing millions of tokens in a single pass. However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the "lost in the middle" problem has been largely resolved in newer models. This study emphasizes the gap between the theoretical capacity and the actual performance of models on complex, high-volume data tasks and highlights the importance of metrics beyond simple accuracy for practical applications.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14189">Knowing When Not to Answer: Abstention-Aware Scientific Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Samir Abdaljalil, Erchin Serpedin, Hasan Kurban</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to answer and verify scientific claims, yet existing evaluations typically assume that a model must always produce a definitive answer. In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

<p>Abstract: The "thinking-with-images" paradigm enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to actively explore visual scenes via zoom-in tools. This is essential for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing VQA, where task-relevant cues are sparse and tiny. However, we observe a consistent failure mode in existing zoom-enabled MLLMs: Tool Usage Homogenization, where tool calls collapse into task-agnostic patterns, limiting effective evidence acquisition. To address this, we propose GeoEyes, a staged training framework consisting of (1) a cold-start SFT dataset, UHR Chain-of-Zoom (UHR-CoZ), which covers diverse zooming regimes, and (2) an agentic reinforcement learning method, AdaZoom-GRPO, that explicitly rewards evidence gain and answer improvement during zoom interactions. The resulting model learns on-demand zooming with proper stopping behavior and achieves substantial improvements on UHR remote sensing benchmarks, with 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojun Jia, Jie Liao, Simeng Qin, Jindong Gu, Wenqi Ren, Xiaochun Cao, Yang Liu, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: Agent skills are becoming a core abstraction in coding agents, packaging long-form instructions and auxiliary scripts to extend tool-augmented behaviors. This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution. Extensive experiments across diverse coding-agent settings and real-world software engineering tasks show that our method consistently achieves high attack success rates under realistic settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Purpose: Reasoning language models (RLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in solving complex reasoning tasks. We examined their potential to assess parental cooperation during CPS interventions using case reports, a case factor characterized by ambiguous and conflicting information. Methods: A four stage workflow comprising (1) case reports collection, (2) reasoning-based assessment of parental cooperation, (3) automated category extraction, and (4) case labeling was developed. The performance of RLMs with different parameter sizes (255B, 32B, 4B) was compared against human validated data. Two expert human reviewers (EHRs) independently classified a weighted random sample of reports. Results: The largest RLM achieved the highest accuracy (89%), outperforming the initial approach (80%). Classification accuracy was higher for mothers (93%) than for fathers (85%), and EHRs exhibited similar differences. Conclusions: RLMs' reasoning can effectively assess complex case factors such as parental cooperation. Lower accuracy in assessing fathers' cooperation supports the argument of a stronger professional focus on mothers in CPS interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial workflows, but evaluation practice has not kept up. Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim. We propose a Structural Validity Framework and an evaluation checklist with minimal requirements for bias diagnosis and future system design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishnu Sai, Dheeraj Sai, Srinath B, Girish Varma, Priyesh Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-based object addition is often hindered by the ambiguity of text-only prompts or the tedious nature of mask-based inputs. To address this usability gap, we introduce AbracADDbra, a user-friendly framework that leverages intuitive touch priors to spatially ground succinct instructions for precise placement. Our efficient, decoupled architecture uses a vision-language transformer for touch-guided placement, followed by a diffusion model that jointly generates the object and an instance mask for high-fidelity blending. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we contribute the Touch2Add benchmark for this interactive task. Our extensive evaluations, where our placement model significantly outperforms both random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, confirm the framework's ability to produce high-fidelity edits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality, validating our decoupled approach. This work thus paves the way for more accessible and efficient creative tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nafiseh Sadat Sajadi, Behnam Bahrak, Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting links in sparse, continuously evolving networks is a central challenge in network science. Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection is often handled by single detectors or static ensembles, even though strong performance on tabular data typically comes from heterogeneous model families (e.g., tree ensembles, deep tabular networks, and tabular foundation models) that frequently disagree under distribution shift, missingness, and rare-anomaly regimes. We propose MAD, a Multi-Agent Debating framework that treats this disagreement as a first-class signal and resolves it through a mathematically grounded coordination layer. Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingxiang Hu, Yiding Sun, Tianle Xia, Wenwei Li, Ming Xu, Liqun Liu, Peng Shu, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, evaluating their performance in real-world environments has become a critical problem. Current benchmarks, however, are largely restricted to idealized simulations, failing to address the practical demands of specialized domains like advertising and marketing analytics. In these fields, tasks are inherently more complex, often requiring multi-round interaction with professional marketing tools. To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios. AD-Bench provides a realistic benchmark for evaluating and improving advertising marketing agents, the leaderboard and code can be found at https://github.com/Emanual20/adbench-leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manal Rahal, Bestoun S. Ahmed, Roger Renstr\"om, Robert Stener</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid increase in residential heat pump (HP) installations, optimizing hot water production in households is essential, yet it faces major technical and scalability challenges. Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.
  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael M. Batista, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: People increasingly use large language models (LLMs) to explore ideas, gather information, and make sense of the world. In these interactions, they encounter agents that are overly agreeable. We argue that this sycophancy poses a unique epistemic risk to how individuals come to see the world: unlike hallucinations that introduce falsehoods, sycophancy distorts reality by returning responses that are biased to reinforce existing beliefs. We provide a rational analysis of this phenomenon, showing that when a Bayesian agent is provided with data that are sampled based on a current hypothesis the agent becomes increasingly confident about that hypothesis but does not make any progress towards the truth. We test this prediction using a modified Wason 2-4-6 rule discovery task where participants (N=557) interacted with AI agents providing different types of feedback. Unmodified LLM behavior suppressed discovery and inflated confidence comparably to explicitly sycophantic prompting. By contrast, unbiased sampling from the true distribution yielded discovery rates five times higher. These results reveal how sycophantic AI distorts belief, manufacturing certainty where there should be doubt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boning Zhou, Ziyu Wang, Han Hong, Haoqi Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal inference, a critical tool for informing business decisions, traditionally relies heavily on structured data. However, in many real-world scenarios, such data can be incomplete or unavailable. This paper presents a framework that leverages transformer-based language models to perform causal inference using unstructured text. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing causal estimates derived from unstructured text against those obtained from structured data across population, group, and individual levels. Our findings show consistent results between the two approaches, validating the potential of unstructured text in causal inference tasks. Our approach extends the applicability of causal inference methods to scenarios where only textual data is available, enabling data-driven business decision-making when structured tabular data is scarce.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lamine Rihani</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems and emerging quantum computing software present unprecedented testing challenges characterized by high-dimensional/continuous input spaces, probabilistic/non-deterministic output distributions, behavioral correctness defined exclusively over observable prediction behaviors and measurement outcomes, and critical quality dimensions, trustworthiness, fairness, calibration, robustness, error syndrome patterns, that manifest through complex multi-way interactions among semantically meaningful output properties rather than deterministic input-output mappings. This paper introduces reverse n-wise output testing, a mathematically principled paradigm inversion that constructs covering arrays directly over domain-specific output equivalence classes, ML confidence calibration buckets, decision boundary regions, fairness partitions, embedding clusters, ranking stability bands, quantum measurement outcome distributions (0-dominant, 1-dominant, superposition collapse), error syndrome patterns (bit-flip, phase-flip, correlated errors), then solves the computationally challenging black-box inverse mapping problem via gradient-free metaheuristic optimization to synthesize input feature configurations or quantum circuit parameters capable of eliciting targeted behavioral signatures from opaque models. The framework delivers synergistic benefits across both domains: explicit customer-centric prediction/measurement coverage guarantees, substantial improvements in fault detection rates for ML calibration/boundary failures and quantum error syndromes, enhanced test suite efficiency, and structured MLOps/quantum validation pipelines with automated partition discovery from uncertainty analysis and coverage drift monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruomeng Ding, Tianwei Gao, Thomas P. Zollo, Eitan Bachmat, Richard Zemel, Zhun Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhen Zhuang, Yuqing Fu, Jing Zhu, Zhangping Zhou, Jialiang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) has entered the coexistence phase with traditional peer review, where artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly incorporated into real-world manuscript evaluation. In parallel, research on automated and AI-assisted peer review has proliferated. Despite this momentum, empirical progress remains constrained by several critical limitations in existing datasets. While reviewers routinely evaluate figures, tables, and complex layouts to assess scientific claims, most existing datasets remain overwhelmingly text-centric. This bias is reinforced by a narrow focus on data from computer science venues. Furthermore, these datasets lack precise alignment between reviewer comments and specific manuscript versions, obscuring the iterative relationship between peer review and manuscript evolution. In response, we introduce FMMD, a multimodal and multidisciplinary open peer review dataset curated from F1000Research. The dataset bridges the current gap by integrating manuscript-level visual and structural data with version-specific reviewer reports and editorial decisions. By providing explicit alignment between reviewer comments and the exact article iteration under review, FMMD enables fine-grained analysis of the peer review lifecycle across diverse scientific domains. FMMD supports tasks such as multimodal issue detection and multimodal review comment generation. It provides a comprehensive empirical resource for the development of peer review research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kris Shengjun Dong, Sahil Modi, Dima Nikiforov, Sana Damani, Edward Lin, Siva Kumar Sastry Hari, Christos Kozyrakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing CUDA code across multiple generations of GPU architectures is challenging, as achieving peak performance requires an extensive exploration of an increasingly complex, hardware-specific optimization space. Traditional compilers are constrained by fixed heuristics, whereas finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be expensive. However, agentic workflows for CUDA code optimization have limited ability to aggregate knowledge from prior exploration, leading to biased sampling and suboptimal solutions. We propose KernelBlaster, a Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning (MAIC-RL) framework designed to improve CUDA optimization search capabilities of LLM-based GPU coding agents. KernelBlaster enables agents to learn from experience and make systematically informed decisions on future tasks by accumulating knowledge into a retrievable Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base. We propose a novel profile-guided, textual-gradient-based agentic flow for CUDA generation and optimization to achieve high performance across generations of GPU architectures. KernelBlaster guides LLM agents to systematically explore high-potential optimization strategies beyond naive rewrites. Compared to the PyTorch baseline, our method achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.43x, 2.50x, and 1.50x on KernelBench Levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We release KernelBlaster as an open-source agentic framework, accompanied by a test harness, verification components, and a reproducible evaluation pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edwin Chen, Zulekha Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Machine Learning as a Tool (MLAT), a design pattern in which pre-trained statistical machine learning models are exposed as callable tools within large language model (LLM) agent workflows. This allows an orchestrating agent to invoke quantitative predictions when needed and reason about their outputs in context. Unlike conventional pipelines that treat ML inference as a static preprocessing step, MLAT positions the model as a first-class tool alongside web search, database queries, and APIs, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use it based on conversational context.
  To validate MLAT, we present PitchCraft, a pilot production system that converts discovery call recordings into professional proposals with ML-predicted pricing. The system uses two agents: a Research Agent that gathers prospect intelligence via parallel tool calls, and a Draft Agent that invokes an XGBoost pricing model as a tool call and generates a complete proposal through structured outputs. The pricing model, trained on 70 examples combining real and human-verified synthetic data, achieves R^2 = 0.807 on held-out data with a mean absolute error of 3688 USD. The system reduces proposal generation time from multiple hours to under 10 minutes.
  We describe the MLAT framework, structured output architecture, training methodology under extreme data scarcity, and sensitivity analysis demonstrating meaningful learned relationships. MLAT generalizes to domains requiring quantitative estimation combined with contextual reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Xirui Li, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyuan Li, Jia Hu, Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem, Geyong Min, Haojun Huang, Jiwei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE are transforming generative AI in natural language processing. However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saar Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Coalition formation concerns strategic collaborations of selfish agents that form coalitions based on their preferences. It is often assumed that coalitions are disjoint and preferences are fully known, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a central role in large language model (LLM) post-training. Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average. Despite the substantial reduction in compute, AERO matches or improves Pass@8 and Avg@8 over GRPO, demonstrating a practical, scalable, and compute-efficient strategy for RL-based LLM alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study instruction following in multi-task reinforcement learning, where an agent must zero-shot execute novel tasks not seen during training. In this setting, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful framework for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks. While existing approaches successfully train generalist policies, they often struggle to effectively capture the rich logical and temporal structure inherent in LTL specifications. In this work, we address these concerns with a novel approach to learn structured task representations that facilitate training and generalisation. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of Boolean formulae constructed from a finite automaton of the task. We propose a hierarchical neural architecture to encode the logical structure of these formulae, and introduce an attention mechanism that enables the policy to reason about future subgoals. Experiments in a variety of complex environments demonstrate the strong generalisation capabilities and superior performance of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirali Sajadi, Tu Nguyen, Kostadin Damevski, Preetha Chatterjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Vulnerability detection tools are widely adopted in software projects, yet they often overwhelm maintainers with false positives and non-actionable reports. Automated exploitation systems can help validate these reports; however, existing approaches typically operate in isolation from detection pipelines, failing to leverage readily available metadata such as vulnerability type and source-code location. In this paper, we investigate how reported security vulnerabilities can be assessed in a realistic grey-box exploitation setting that leverages minimal vulnerability metadata, specifically a CWE classification and a vulnerable code location. We introduce Agentic eXploit Engine (AXE), a multi-agent framework for Web application exploitation that maps lightweight detection metadata to concrete exploits through decoupled planning, code exploration, and dynamic execution feedback. Evaluated on the CVE-Bench dataset, AXE achieves a 30% exploitation success rate, a 3x improvement over state-of-the-art black-box baselines. Even in a single-agent configuration, grey-box metadata yields a 1.75x performance gain. Systematic error analysis shows that most failed attempts arise from specific reasoning gaps, including misinterpreted vulnerability semantics and unmet execution preconditions. For successful exploits, AXE produces actionable, reproducible proof-of-concept artifacts, demonstrating its utility in streamlining Web vulnerability triage and remediation. We further evaluate AXE's generalizability through a case study on a recent real-world vulnerability not included in CVE-Bench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning promises strong sample efficiency but often underperforms in practice due to compounding model error, unimodal world models that average over multi-modal dynamics, and overconfident predictions that bias learning. We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly developed for use in complex professional domains, yet little is known about how teams design and evaluate these systems in practice. This paper examines the challenges and trade-offs in LLM development through a 12-week ethnographic study of a team building a pedagogical chatbot. The researcher observed design and evaluation activities and conducted interviews with both developers and domain experts. Analysis revealed four key practices: creating workarounds for data collection, turning to augmentation when expert input was limited, co-developing evaluation criteria with experts, and adopting hybrid expert-developer-LLM evaluation strategies. These practices show how teams made strategic decisions under constraints and demonstrate the central role of domain expertise in shaping the system. Challenges included expert motivation and trust, difficulties structuring participatory design, and questions around ownership and integration of expert knowledge. We propose design opportunities for future LLM development workflows that emphasize AI literacy, transparent consent, and frameworks recognizing evolving expert roles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Airbnb search must balance a worldwide, highly varied supply of homes with guests whose location, amenity, style, and price expectations differ widely. Meeting those expectations hinges on an efficient retrieval stage that surfaces only the listings a guest might realistically book, before resource intensive ranking models are applied to determine the best results. Unlike many recommendation engines, our system faces a distinctive challenge, location retrieval, that sits upstream of ranking and determines which geographic areas are queried in order to filter inventory to a candidate set. The preexisting approach employs a deep bayesian bandit based system to predict a rectangular retrieval bounds area that can be used for filtering. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology, challenges, and impact of rearchitecting search to retrieve from the subset of most bookable high precision rectangular map cells defined by dividing the world into 25M uniform cells.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Dongrui Liu, Xia Hu, Jingyi Yu, Wenjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Clawdbot is a self-hosted, tool-using personal AI agent with a broad action space spanning local execution and web-mediated workflows, which raises heightened safety and security concerns under ambiguity and adversarial steering. We present a trajectory-centric evaluation of Clawdbot across six risk dimensions. Our test suite samples and lightly adapts scenarios from prior agent-safety benchmarks (including ATBench and LPS-Bench) and supplements them with hand-designed cases tailored to Clawdbot's tool surface. We log complete interaction trajectories (messages, actions, tool-call arguments/outputs) and assess safety using both an automated trajectory judge (AgentDoG-Qwen3-4B) and human review. Across 34 canonical cases, we find a non-uniform safety profile: performance is generally consistent on reliability-focused tasks, while most failures arise under underspecified intent, open-ended goals, or benign-seeming jailbreak prompts, where minor misinterpretations can escalate into higher-impact tool actions. We supplemented the overall results with representative case studies and summarized the commonalities of these cases, analyzing the security vulnerabilities and typical failure modes that Clawdbot is prone to trigger in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shun Kato (Keio University, Japan), Yasushi Kondo (Keio University, Japan), Shuntaro Saito (Keio University, Japan), Yoshimitsu Aoki (Keio University, Japan), Mariko Isogawa (Keio University, Japan)</p>
<p>Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has catalyzed a surge in scientific idea production, yet this leap has not been accompanied by a matching advance in idea evaluation. The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Tang, James Flemings, Yongqin Wang, Murali Annavaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely used framework for reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks by retrieving relevant documents from a database to support accurate responses. However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Fosdick (Daydream)</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqian Yang, Hao Wang, Sai Qian Zhang, Jian Li, Yang Hua, Miao Pan, Tao Song, Zhengwei Qi, Haibing Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation VLN requires large-scale trajectory instruction data from private indoor environments, raising significant privacy concerns. Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.</p>

We provide a human-annotated benchmark of 1,500 instances across argument mining and claim-based stance detection, including inter-annotator agreement, and use it to evaluate large language model (LLM) prompting strategies. Using the best-performing configuration, we release additional LLM-generated labels for 24,352 posts (argument presence) and 107,873 comments (stance to parent), enabling analysis of stance and argumentation patterns across depth, topics, and users.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongqiang Zhao, Hengrui Hu, Yijing Wang, Mingchun Sun, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14423">The geometry of invariant learning: an information-theoretic analysis of data augmentation and generalization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelali Bouyahia, Fr\'ed\'eric LeBlanc, Mario Marchand</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization in modern machine learning, often justified by its ability to promote invariance to label-irrelevant transformations. However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Chavan, Nahush Lele, Udbhav Bamba, Sankalp Dayal, Aditi Raghunathan, Deepak Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation outliers in large-scale transformer models pose a fundamental challenge to model quantization, creating excessively large ranges that cause severe accuracy drops during quantization. We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fred Zimmerman</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a system for autonomous book ideation that replaces human focus groups with synthetic reader panels -- diverse collections of LLM-instantiated reader personas that evaluate book concepts through structured tournament competitions. Each persona is defined by demographic attributes (age group, gender, income, education, reading level), behavioral patterns (books per year, genre preferences, discovery methods, price sensitivity), and consistency parameters. Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential. To reject low-quality LLM evaluations, we implement five automated anti-slop checks (repetitive phrasing, generic framing, circular reasoning, score clustering, audience mismatch). We report results from deployment within a multi-imprint publishing operation managing 6 active imprints and 609 titles in distribution. Three case studies -- a 270-evaluator panel for a children's literacy novel, and two 5-person expert panels for a military memoir and a naval strategy monograph -- demonstrate that synthetic panels produce actionable demographic segmentation, identify structural content issues invisible to homogeneous reviewers, and enable tournament filtering that eliminates low-quality concepts while enriching high-quality survivors from 15% to 62% of the evaluated pool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Su, Gaurav Purushothaman, Jey Narayan, Ruhika Goel, Kevin Zhu, Sunishchal Dev, Yash More, Maheep Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning-specialized models like OpenAI's 5.1 and DeepSeek-V3.2 allocate substantial inference compute to extended chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, yet reasoning tokens incur significant costs. How do different reasoning modalities of code, natural language, hybrid, or none do perform under token constraints? We introduce a framework that constrains models to reason exclusively through code, comments, both, or neither, then systematically ablates token budgets to 10\%, 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% of optimal. We evaluate four frontier models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Flash, DeepSeek-V3.2, Grok 4.1) across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, GSM8K, HMMT). Our findings reveal: (1) \textbf{truncated reasoning can hurt} as DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves 53\% with no reasoning but only 17\% with truncated CoT at 50\% budget; (2) \textbf{code degrades gracefully} as Gemini's comments collapse to 0\% while code maintains 43-47\%; (3) \textbf{hybrid reasoning underperforms} single modalities; (4) \textbf{robustness is model-dependent} as Grok maintains 80-90\% at 30\% budget where OpenAI and DeepSeek collapse to 7-27\%. These results suggest incomplete reasoning chains actively mislead models, with implications for deploying reasoning-specialized systems under resource constraints.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14445">Selective Synchronization Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasi Hays</p>
<p>Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Chen, Yuan Meng, Xiaoyu Zhan, Zhi Wang, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities but incur high inference costs due to dense computation and memory access. Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed. Our research advances the limits of training-free approaches for efficient LLM inference, pushing the boundaries of achievable speedup without training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Li, Zhen Zhou, Honggang Zhang, Yuping Luo, Xinyue Wang, Han Gong, Zhiyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-parallel (DP) training with synchronous all-reduce is a dominant paradigm for full-parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves. These findings demonstrate that the proposed indicators provide actionable visibility into hidden instability modes in large-scale DP fine-tuning, enabling more reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transferring visual style between images while preserving semantic correspondence between similar objects remains a central challenge in computer vision. While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying large language model (LLM) agents in shared environments introduces a fundamental tension between individual alignment and collective stability: locally rational decisions can impose negative externalities that degrade system-level performance. We propose Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a game-theoretic framework that modifies inference-time decision making by interpolating between an agent's private objective and an estimate of group welfare via a social weight $\lambda\in[0,1]$. In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $\beta$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $\lambda^*=(n-\beta)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quadruped robots are employed in various scenarios in building construction. However, autonomous stair climbing across different indoor staircases remains a major challenge for robot dogs to complete building construction tasks. In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.</p>

Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures. We derive six design principles for educational AI, including leveraging validation-before-extension patterns and supporting multilingual learning networks. Our work provides the first empirical characterization of peer learning among AI agents, contributing to EDM's understanding of how learning occurs in increasingly AI-populated educational environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingxuan Chai, Yong Xiao, Guangming Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic communication is a novel communication paradigm that focuses on conveying the user's intended meaning rather than the bit-wise transmission of source signals. One of the key challenges is to effectively represent and extract the semantic meaning of any given source signals. While deep learning (DL)-based solutions have shown promising results in extracting implicit semantic information from a wide range of sources, existing work often overlooks the high computational complexity inherent in both model training and inference for the DL-based encoder and decoder. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ding, Zhichuan Yang, Weijie Ge, Ziqin Gao, Chaoyi Lu, Lei Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We address fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where key evidence may reside in tiny objects, cluttered regions, or subtle markings that are lost under a single global image encoding. We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Gr\"oger, Shuo Wen, Maria Brbi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Najib Hasan, Mst. Jannatun Ferdous Rain, Fyad Mohammed, Nazmul Siddique</p>
<p>Abstract: IR in low-resource languages remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality, task-specific annotated datasets. Manual annotation is expensive and difficult to scale, while using large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators introduces concerns about label reliability, bias, and evaluation validity. This work presents a Bangla IR dataset constructed using a BETA-labeling framework involving multiple LLM annotators from diverse model families. The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR. It provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with cross-lingual dataset reuse and offers practical guidance for constructing more reliable benchmarks and evaluation pipelines in low-resource language settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buze Zhang, Jinkai Tao, Zilang Zeng, Neil He, Ali Maatouk, Menglin Yang, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Freund, Tom Jurgenson, Matan Sudry, Erez Karpas</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic knot-tying represents a fundamental challenge in robotics due to the complex interactions between deformable objects and strict topological constraints. We present TWISTED-RL, a framework that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in demonstration-free knot-tying (TWISTED), which smartly decomposed a single knot-tying problem into manageable subproblems, each addressed by a specialized agent. Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yang, Wenze Lin, Enhao Huang, Zhixuan Chu, Hongbin Zhou, Lan Tao, Yiming Li, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinqi Lin, Ningning Ding, Lingjie Duan, Jianwei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shishir Sharma, Doina Precup, Theodore J. Perkins</p>
<p>Abstract: The primary focus of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been to study interactions among a fixed number of agents embedded in an environment. However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14587">Decoupled Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning via Hamiltonian Flow</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world control problems, ranging from finance to robotics, evolve in continuous time with non-uniform, event-driven decisions. Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evgenii Kniazev</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an automated method for classifying source code changes during the software development process based on clustering of change metrics. The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05.</p>

<p>Abstract: The opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, straining healthcare systems, disrupting families, and demanding urgent computational solutions. To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Manuel de la Chica Rodriguez, Juan Manuel Vera D\'iaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-duration audio is increasingly common in industrial and consumer settings, yet reviewing multi-hour recordings is impractical, motivating systems that answer natural-language queries with precise temporal grounding and minimal hallucination. Existing audio-language models show promise, but long-audio question answering remains difficult due to context-length limits. We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud. Experiments show that structured, event-level retrieval significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or text-to-SQL approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aswathi Varma, Suprosanna Shit, Chinmay Prabhakar, Daniel Scholz, Hongwei Bran Li, Bjoern Menze, Daniel Rueckert, Benedikt Wiestler</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for delaying its progression. While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

<p>Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as an effective approach towards collaborative intelligence, and have attracted wide research interests. Among them, ``self-evolving'' MAS, treated as a more flexible and powerful technical route, can construct task-adaptive workflows or communication topologies, instead of relying on a predefined static structue template. Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzan Farnia, Mohammad Jalali, Azim Ospanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chanin, Adri\`a Garriga-Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) requires benchmarks that can precisely validate architectural innovations. However, current SAE benchmarks on LLMs are often too noisy to differentiate architectural improvements, and current synthetic data experiments are too small-scale and unrealistic to provide meaningful comparisons. We introduce SynthSAEBench, a toolkit for generating large-scale synthetic data with realistic feature characteristics including correlation, hierarchy, and superposition, and a standardized benchmark model, SynthSAEBench-16k, enabling direct comparison of SAE architectures. Our benchmark reproduces several previously observed LLM SAE phenomena, including the disconnect between reconstruction and latent quality metrics, poor SAE probing results, and a precision-recall trade-off mediated by L0. We further use our benchmark to identify a new failure mode: Matching Pursuit SAEs exploit superposition noise to improve reconstruction without learning ground-truth features, suggesting that more expressive encoders can easily overfit. SynthSAEBench complements LLM benchmarks by providing ground-truth features and controlled ablations, enabling researchers to precisely diagnose SAE failure modes and validate architectural improvements before scaling to LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Struppek, Adam Gleave, Kellin Pelrine</p>
<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models continue to advance, so does their potential for misuse. While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper envisions a quantum database (Qute) that treats quantum computation as a first-class execution option. Unlike prior simulation-based methods that either run quantum algorithms on classical machines or adapt existing databases for quantum simulation, Qute instead (i) compiles an extended form of SQL into gate-efficient quantum circuits, (ii) employs a hybrid optimizer to dynamically select between quantum and classical execution plans, (iii) introduces selective quantum indexing, and (iv) designs fidelity-preserving storage to mitigate current qubit constraints. We also present a three-stage evolution roadmap toward quantum-native database. Finally, by deploying Qute on a real quantum processor (origin_wukong), we show that it outperforms a classical baseline at scale, and we release an open-source prototype at https://github.com/weAIDB/Qute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojie Jiang, Svitlana Vakulenko, Maarten de Rijke</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational search (CS) requires a complex software engineering pipeline that integrates query reformulation, ranking, and response generation. CS researchers currently face two barriers: the lack of a unified framework for efficiently sharing contributions with the community, and the difficulty of deploying end-to-end prototypes needed for user evaluation. We introduce Orcheo, an open-source platform designed to bridge this gap. Orcheo offers three key advantages: (i) A modular architecture promotes component reuse through single-file node modules, facilitating sharing and reproducibility in CS research; (ii) Production-ready infrastructure bridges the prototype-to-system gap via dual execution modes, secure credential management, and execution telemetry, with built-in AI coding support that lowers the learning curve; (iii) Starter-kit assets include 50+ off-the-shelf components for query understanding, ranking, and response generation, enabling the rapid bootstrapping of complete CS pipelines. We describe the framework architecture and validate Orcheo's utility through case studies that highlight modularity and ease of use.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kohio Deflesselle, M\'elodie Daniel, Aly Magassouba, Miguel Aranda, Olivier Ly</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodrigo Carmo Terin</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks with positively homogeneous activations exhibit an exact continuous reparametrization symmetry: neuron-wise rescalings generate parameter-space orbits along which the input--output function is invariant. We interpret this symmetry as a gauge redundancy and introduce gauge-adapted coordinates that separate invariant and scale-imbalance directions. Inspired by gauge fixing in field theory, we introduce a soft orbit-selection (norm-balancing) functional acting only on redundant scale coordinates. We show analytically that it induces dissipative relaxation of imbalance modes to preserve the realized function. In controlled experiments, this orbit-selection penalty expands the stable learning-rate regime and suppresses scale drift without changing expressivity. These results establish a structural link between gauge-orbit geometry and optimization conditioning, providing a concrete connection between gauge-theoretic concepts and machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Lys, Vincent Gripon, Bastien Pasdeloup, Lukas Mauch, Fabien Cardinaux, Ghouthi Boukli Hacene</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Lys, Vincent Gripon, Bastien Pasdeloup, Lukas Mauch, Fabien Cardinaux, Ghouthi Boukli Hacene</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with next-token prediction, implemented in autoregressive Transformers via causal masking for parallelism. This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefano Woerner, Seong Joon Oh, Christian F. Baumgartner</p>
<p>Abstract: Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like "universal" and "general-purpose" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Rajaee, Sebastian Vincent, Alexandre Berard, Marzieh Fadaee, Kelly Marchisio, Tom Kocmi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) achieve strong gains on tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating explicit intermediate reasoning. However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shih-Fang Chen, Jun-Cheng Chen, I-Hong Jhuo, Yen-Yu Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hallucinations -- fluent but factually incorrect responses -- pose a major challenge to the reliability of language models, especially in multi-step or agentic settings.
  This work investigates hallucinations in small-sized LLMs through a geometric perspective, starting from the hypothesis that when models generate multiple responses to the same prompt, genuine ones exhibit tighter clustering in the embedding space, we prove this hypothesis and, leveraging this geometrical insight, we also show that it is possible to achieve a consistent level of separability. This latter result is used to introduce a label-efficient propagation method that classifies large collections of responses from just 30-50 annotations, achieving F1 scores above 90%.
  Our findings, framing hallucinations from a geometric perspective in the embedding space, complement traditional knowledge-centric and single-response evaluation paradigms, paving the way for further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) is raising concerns about its potential to transform cybercrime. Beyond empowering novice offenders, AI stands to intensify the scale and sophistication of attacks by seasoned cybercriminals. This paper examines the evolving relationship between cybercriminals and AI using a unique dataset from a cyber threat intelligence platform. Analyzing more than 160 cybercrime forum conversations collected over seven months, our research reveals how cybercriminals understand AI and discuss how they can exploit its capabilities. Their exchanges reflect growing curiosity about AI's criminal applications through legal tools and dedicated criminal tools, but also doubts and anxieties about AI's effectiveness and its effects on their business models and operational security. The study documents attempts to misuse legitimate AI tools and develop bespoke models tailored for illicit purposes. Combining the diffusion of innovation framework with thematic analysis, the paper provides an in-depth view of emerging AI-enabled cybercrime and offers practical insights for law enforcement and policymakers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Pan, Yonekura Shogo, Yasuo Kuniyosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a "shortcut regime" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre-Alexandre Mattei, Bruno Loureiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Temperature scaling is a simple method that allows to control the uncertainty of probabilistic models. It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilia Mahrooghi, Aryo Lotfi, Emmanuel Abbe</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Huang, Zixin Wen, Yuejie Chi, Yuting Wei, Aarti Singh, Yingbin Liang, Yuxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a main driver of recent breakthroughs in large reasoning models. Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eloi Martinet, Ilias Ftouhi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel numerical framework for the exploration of Blaschke--Santal\'o diagrams, which are efficient tools characterizing the possible inequalities relating some given shape functionals. We introduce a parametrization of convex bodies in arbitrary dimensions using a specific invertible neural network architecture based on gauge functions, allowing an intrinsic conservation of the convexity of the sets during the shape optimization process. To achieve a uniform sampling inside the diagram, and thus a satisfying description of it, we introduce an interacting particle system that minimizes a Riesz energy functional via automatic differentiation in PyTorch. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on several diagrams involving both geometric and PDE-type functionals for convex bodies of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, namely, the volume, the perimeter, the moment of inertia, the torsional rigidity, the Willmore energy, and the first two Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pramit Saha, Joshua Strong, Mohammad Alsharid, Divyanshu Mishra, J. Alison Noble</p>
<p>Abstract: Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single "best" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fiorenzo Parascandolo, Wenhui Tan, Enver Sangineto, Ruihua Song, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown excellent performance in reasoning tasks using long reasoning chains. However, this has also led to a significant increase of computational costs and the generation of verbose output, a phenomenon known as overthinking. The tendency to overthinking is often exacerbated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as GRPO/DAPO. In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Ma, Yiyue Qian, Zehong Wang, Zheyuan Zhang, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraph Neural Networks (HyGNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling higher-order relationships among entities. However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zun Wang, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Jaemin Cho, Yue Zhang, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yian Wang, Han Yang, Minghao Guo, Xiaowen Qiu, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Wojciech Matusik, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayush Shrivastava, Kirtan Gangani, Laksh Jain, Mayank Goel, Nipun Batra</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometric deep learning (GDL) deals with supervised learning on data domains that go beyond Euclidean structure, such as data with graph or manifold structure. Due to the demand that arises from application-related data, there is a need to identify further topological and geometric structures with which these use cases can be made accessible to machine learning. There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL. The theory discussed is illustrated using an example from music theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinandan Bose, Shuyue Stella Li, Faeze Brahman, Pang Wei Koh, Simon Shaolei Du, Yulia Tsvetkov, Maryam Fazel, Lin Xiao, Asli Celikyilmaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cai Zhou, Zijie Chen, Zian Li, Jike Wang, Kaiyi Jiang, Pan Li, Rose Yu, Muhan Zhang, Stephen Bates, Tommi Jaakkola</p>
<p>Abstract: Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangding Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in privacy-critical and personalization-oriented scenarios, yet the role of context length in shaping privacy leakage and personalization effectiveness remains largely unexplored. We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/PAPerBench</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S{\o}ren Riis</p>
<p>Abstract: We study impartial games under fixed-latency, fixed-scale quantised inference (FSQI). In this fixed-scale, bounded-range regime, we prove that inference is simulable by constant-depth polynomial-size Boolean circuits (AC0). This yields a worst-case representational barrier: single-frame agents in the FSQI/AC0 regime cannot strongly master NIM, because optimal play depends on the global nim-sum (parity). Under our stylised deterministic rollout interface, a single rollout policy head from the structured family analysed here reveals only one fixed linear functional of the invariant, so increasing rollout budget alone does not recover the missing bits. We derive two structural bypasses: (1) a multi-policy-head rollout architecture that recovers the full invariant via distinct rollout channels, and (2) a multi-frame architecture that tracks local nimber differences and supports restoration. Experiments across multiple settings are consistent with these predictions: single-head baselines stay near chance, while two-frame models reach near-perfect restoration accuracy and multi-head FSM-controlled shootouts achieve perfect win/loss position classification. Overall, the empirical results support the view that explicit structural priors (history/differences or multiple rollout channels) are important in the FSQI/AC0 regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corina Catarau-Cotutiu, Esther Mondragon, Eduardo Alonso</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them in state-action transitions. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enhance the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions, and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. We demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task relevant structural patterns across CREATE and MiniGrid environments. Finally, we integrate SETLE with reinforcement learning and show measurable improvements in downstream performance, including breakthrough success rates in complex, sparse-reward tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) requires substantial amounts of high-quality reasoning data, particularly in mathematics. Existing data synthesis methods, such as data augmentation from annotated training sets or direct question generation based on relevant knowledge points and documents, have expanded datasets but face challenges in mastering the inner logic of the problem during generation and ensuring the verifiability of the solutions. To address these issues, we propose RV-Syn, a novel Rational and Verifiable mathematical Synthesis approach. RV-Syn constructs a structured mathematical operation function library based on initial seed problems and generates computational graphs as solutions by combining Python-formatted functions from this library. These graphs are then back-translated into complex problems. Based on the constructed computation graph, we achieve solution-guided logic-aware problem generation. Furthermore, the executability of the computational graph ensures the verifiability of the solving process. Experimental results show that RV-Syn surpasses existing synthesis methods, including those involving human-generated problems, achieving greater efficient data scaling. This approach provides a scalable framework for generating high-quality reasoning datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning has emerged as a crucial technique for generalizing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By generating and analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we investigate \ntask datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies \emph{the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps} to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly improves LLM inference efficiency while preserving accuracy, paving the way for more scalable LLM deployments and a better understanding of their internal reasoning.

<p>Abstract: There are many methods and systems to tackle the ontology alignment problem, yet a major challenge persists in producing high-quality mappings among a set of input ontologies. Adopting a human-in-the-loop approach during the alignment process has become essential in applications requiring very accurate mappings. However, user involvement is expensive when dealing with large ontologies. In this paper, we analyse the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLM) to aid the ontology alignment problem. LLMs are used only in the validation of a subset of correspondences for which there is high uncertainty. We have conducted an extensive analysis over several tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), reporting in this paper the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using different prompt templates. Using LLMs as Oracles resulted in strong performance in the OAEI 2025, achieving the top-2 overall rank in the bio-ml track.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adamo Cerioli, Edward D. Lee, Vito D. P. Servedio</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategic decision-making requires balancing immediate opportunities against long-term objectives: a tension fundamental to competitive environments. We investigate this trade-off in chess by analyzing the dynamics of human and AI gameplay through a network-based metric that quantifies piece-to-piece interactions. Our analysis reveals that elite AI players sustain substantially higher levels of strategic tension for longer durations than top human grandmasters. We find that cumulative tension scales with algorithmic complexity in AI systems and increases linearly with skill level (Elo rating) in human play. Longer time controls are associated with higher tension in human games, reflecting the additional strategic complexity players can manage with more thinking time. The temporal profiles reveal contrasting approaches: highly competitive AI systems tolerate densely interconnected positions that balance offensive and defensive tactics over extended periods, while human players systematically limit tension and game complexity. These differences have broader implications for understanding how artificial and biological systems navigate complex strategic environments and for the deployment of AI in high-stakes competitive scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammed Ustaomeroglu, Baris Askin, Gauri Joshi, Carlee Joe-Wong, Guannan Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning, that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range generation, remains an important question, with implications for interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, and considering multiple possible continuations, but how far transformer-based LMs exhibit them without external scaffolds, e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, is unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information and analyzing the computational structure of the underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on two planning properties: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, and (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations. As a separate downstream use of the same pipeline, we also analyze how decision-relevant information is distributed across layers and earlier prefix blocks when producing next-token predictions. Together, these analyses advance our understanding of planning in LMs and provide a general-purpose pipeline for inspecting internal model dynamics. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divij Handa, Mihir Parmar, Aswin RRV, Md Nayem Uddin, Hamid Palangi, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Repeated Sampling (RS) is a simple inference-time algorithm that has been shown to improve model performance on complex tasks. Although it is an effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS. Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance (1.67 -> 3.03), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingni Wang, Yue Fan, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game, ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity, establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ni Zhang, Zhiguang Cao, Jianan Zhou, Cong Zhang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge, demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimization modeling underlies critical decision-making across industries, yet remains difficult to automate: natural-language problem descriptions must be translated into precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Existing LLM-based approaches typically rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining, both of which offer limited generalization. Recent work suggests that large models can improve via experience reuse, but how to systematically acquire, refine, and reuse such experience in structurally constrained settings remains unclear. We present \textbf{AlphaOPT}, a self-improving experience library that enables LLMs to learn optimization modeling knowledge from limited supervision, including answer-only feedback without gold-standard programs, annotated reasoning traces, or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: a \emph{Library Learning} phase that extracts solver-verified, structured insights from failed attempts, and a \emph{Library Evolution} phase that refines the applicability of stored insights based on aggregate evidence across tasks. This design allows the model to accumulate reusable modeling principles, improve transfer across problem instances, and maintain bounded library growth over time. Evaluated on multiple optimization benchmarks, AlphaOPT steadily improves as more training data become available (65\% $\rightarrow$ 72\% from 100 to 300 training items) and outperforms the strongest baseline by 9.1\% and 8.2\% on two out-of-distribution datasets. These results demonstrate that structured experience learning, grounded in solver feedback, provides a practical alternative to retraining for complex reasoning tasks requiring precise formulation and execution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyuyeon Na, Minjung Park, Hyeonjeong Cha, Sangmi Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in digital-asset transactions. The system integrates three cognitively aligned roles: Rule Abstraction, Evidence Scoring, and Expert-Style Justification. These roles operate in a conversational workflow that enables non-experts to express analytical intent in natural language, inspect structured risk evidence, and obtain traceable, context-aware reasoning.
  Implemented with an open-source, web-based interface, HCLA translates user intent into explicit analytical rules, applies classical anomaly detectors to quantify evidential risk, and reconstructs expert-style justifications grounded in observable transactional signals. Experiments on a cryptocurrency anomaly dataset show that, while the underlying detector achieves strong predictive accuracy, HCLA substantially improves interpretability, interaction, and decision transparency.
  Importantly, HCLA is not designed to explain a black-box model in the conventional XAI sense. Instead, we reconstruct a traceable expert reasoning process that aligns algorithmic evidence with regulatory and investigative judgment. By explicitly separating evidence scoring from expert-style justification, the framework emphasizes accountability beyond explainability and addresses practical requirements for regulatory, audit, and compliance-driven financial forensics.
  We describe the system architecture, closed-loop interaction design, datasets, evaluation protocol, and limitations. We argue that a human-in-the-loop reasoning reconstruction paradigm is essential for achieving transparency, accountability, and trust in high-stakes financial environments.

<p>Abstract: The growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in materials discovery, molecular modeling, and climate science has made data preparation a critical but labor-intensive bottleneck. Raw data from diverse sources must be cleaned, normalized, and transformed to become AI-ready, where effective feature transformation and selection are essential for robust learning. We present Dataforge, an LLM-powered agentic data engineering platform for tabular data that is automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly. It autonomously performs data cleaning and iteratively optimizes feature operations under a budgeted feedback loop with automatic stopping. Across tabular benchmarks, it achieves the best overall downstream performance; ablations further confirm the roles of routing/iterative refinement and grounding in accuracy and reliability. Dataforge demonstrates a practical path toward autonomous data agents that transform raw data from data to better data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robab Aghazadeh Chakherlou, Siddartha Khastgir, Xingyu Zhao, Jerein Jeyachandran, Shufeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Assuring the trustworthiness and safety of AI systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles (AV), depends critically on the data-related safety properties, e.g., representativeness, completeness, etc., of the datasets used for their training and testing. Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data.
  We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhi Wang, Linan Yue, Min-Ling Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks. Specifically, SynSelect first leverages multiple heterogeneous multimodal LRMs to produce diverse candidate CoTs, and then applies both instance and batch level selection to filter high-quality CoTs that can effectively enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models supervised fine-tuned on SynSelect-generated data significantly outperform baselines and achieve further improvements after reinforcement learning post-training. Our results validate SynSelect as an effective approach for advancing multimodal LRMs reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariana Azarbal, Victor Gillioz, Vladimir Ivanov, Bryce Woodworth, Jacob Drori, Nevan Wichers, Aram Ebtekar, Alex Cloud, Alexander Matt Turner</p>
<p>Abstract: Developers often struggle to specify correct training labels and rewards. Perhaps they don't need to. We propose recontextualization, which reduces how often language models "game" training signals, performing misbehaviors those signals mistakenly reinforce. We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) overwrite evaluation functions rather than write correct code; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Kumar Panda, Olaoluwa Adigun, Bart Kosko</p>
<p>Abstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent system that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy$-$its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while the system still stays on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three system-instruction sets guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.</p>

<p>Abstract: The primary objective of a diverse planning approach is to generate a set of plans that are distinct from one another. Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation.</p>

However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Arslan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to "Vector Haze": the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. This paper proposes Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). The Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism, exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks on Apple M4 Max demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 5us effective retrieval latency on conversational workloads (with 85%+ SLB hit rates), while ensuring state consistency via a sub-microsecond zero-copy C++/Python bridge (~334ns for 10MB payloads), effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Deng, Zhen Fang, Sharon Li, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs' initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shen, Hang Yang, Zhouhong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research systems that iteratively decompose research questions, invoke retrieval tools, and synthesize information across multiple rounds. Evaluating such systems typically involves scoring their final research reports holistically, but this end-to-end paradigm tightly couples the language model's decision-making, workflow design, and environmental feedback, precluding decomposable analysis of individual components. We introduce ScholarGym, an evaluation environment that isolates the information-gathering stage of deep research on academic literature. Under a unified workflow, ScholarGym decomposes the research process into three explicit stages -- Query Planning, Tool Invocation, and Relevance Assessment -- and evaluates each against 2,536 expert-annotated queries over a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval. Systematic experiments reveal that iterative query decomposition yields 2.9--3.3$\times$ F1 gains over single-query retrieval, models with extended thinking trade recall for precision, and Query Planning quality together with Relevance Assessment constitute dual bottlenecks that separate proprietary from open-source model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Liu, Tianle Chen, Ryan Amiri, Christopher Amato</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyejun Jeong, Amir Houmansadr, Shlomo Zilberstein, Eugene Bagdasarian</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI agents increasingly combine conversational interaction with autonomous task execution, such as coding and web research, raising a natural question: what happens when an agent engaged in long-horizon tasks is subjected to user persuasion? We study how belief-level intervention can influence downstream task behavior, a phenomenon we name \emph{persuasion propagation}. We introduce a behavior-centered evaluation framework that distinguishes between persuasion applied during or prior to task execution. Across web research and coding tasks, we find that on-the-fly persuasion induces weak and inconsistent behavioral effects. In contrast, when the belief state is explicitly specified at task time, belief-prefilled agents conduct on average 26.9\% fewer searches and visit 16.9\% fewer unique sources than neutral-prefilled agents. These results suggest that persuasion, even in prior interaction, can affect the agent's behavior, motivating behavior-level evaluation in agentic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Salaheddin Alzu'bi, Baran Nama, Arda Kaz, Anushri Eswaran, Weiyuan Chen, Sarvesh Khetan, Rishab Bala, Tu Vu, Sewoong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Current agentic frameworks underperform on long-horizon tasks. As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5. Our results demonstrate that recursive, modular agent architectures can scale reasoning depth while remaining interpretable, flexible, and model-agnostic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shifat E. Arman, Syed Nazmus Sakib, Tapodhir Karmakar Taton, Nafiul Haque, Shahrear Bin Amin</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.</p>

In this paper, we propose OmniVideo-R1, a novel reinforced framework that improves mixed-modality reasoning. OmniVideo-R1 empowers models to "think with omnimodal cues" by two key strategies: (1) query-intensive grounding based on self-supervised learning paradigms; and (2) modality-attentive fusion built upon contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OmniVideo-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and robust generalization capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Hualin Zhou, Sheng Guang Wang, Ting Dang, Yu Zhang, Hong Jia, Tao Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices is challenged by resource constraints and performance degradation under distribution shifts. While test-time adaptation (TTA) can counteract such shifts, existing methods are too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. To address this challenge, we propose LQA, a lightweight, quantized-adaptive framework for VLMs that combines a modality-aware quantization strategy with gradient-free test-time adaptation. We introduce Selective Hybrid Quantization (SHQ) and a quantized, gradient-free adaptation mechanism to enable robust and efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Experiments across both synthetic and real-world distribution shifts show that LQA improves overall adaptation performance by 4.5\%, uses less memory than full-precision models, and significantly outperforms gradient-based TTA methods, achieving up to 19.9$\times$ lower memory usage across seven open-source datasets. These results demonstrate that LQA offers a practical pathway for robust, privacy-preserving, and efficient VLM deployment on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Igor Santos-Grueiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety evaluation for advanced AI systems assumes that behavior observed under evaluation predicts behavior in deployment. This assumption weakens for agents with situational awareness, which may exploit regime leakage, cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment, to implement conditional policies that comply under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We recast alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability and show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the regime information extractable from decision-relevant internal representations. We study regime-blind mechanisms, training-time interventions that restrict access to regime cues through adversarial invariance constraints without assuming complete information erasure. We evaluate this approach across multiple open-weight language models and controlled failure modes including scientific sycophancy, temporal sleeper agents, and data leakage. Regime-blind training reduces regime-conditioned failures without measurable loss of task utility, but exhibits heterogeneous and model-dependent dynamics. Sycophancy shows a sharp representational and behavioral transition at moderate intervention strength, consistent with a stability cliff. In sleeper-style constructions and certain cross-model replications, suppression occurs without a clean collapse of regime decodability and may display non-monotone or oscillatory behavior as invariance pressure increases. These findings indicate that representational invariance is a meaningful but limited control lever. It can raise the cost of regime-conditioned strategies but cannot guarantee elimination or provide architecture-invariant thresholds. Behavioral evaluation should therefore be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and internal information flow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of a domain-general or consistent ToM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models with reasoning capabilities achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.</p>

Early and accurate detection plays a key role in successful treatment and intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for identifying a variety of cardiovascular abnormalities. In clinical practices and most of the current research, standard 12-lead ECG is mainly used. However, using a lower number of leads can make ECG more prevalent as it can be conveniently recorded by portable or wearable devices. In this research, we develop a novel deep learning system to accurately identify multiple cardiovascular abnormalities by using only three ECG leads.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video prediction is a complex time-series forecasting task with great potential in many use cases. However, traditional methods prioritize accuracy and overlook slow prediction speeds due to complex model structures, redundant information, and excessive GPU memory consumption. These methods often predict frames sequentially, making acceleration difficult and limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios like danger prediction and warning.Therefore, we propose a transformer-based keypoint prediction neural network (TKN). TKN extracts dynamic content from video frames in an unsupervised manner, reducing redundant feature computation. And, TKN uses an acceleration matrix to reduce the computational cost of attention and employs a parallel computing structure for prediction acceleration. To the best of our knowledge, TKN is the first real-time video prediction solution that achieves a prediction rate of 1,176 fps, significantly reducing computation costs while maintaining other performance. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our method, suggesting that TKN has great application potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Liu, Prabhat Nagarajan, Andrew Patterson, Martha White</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning algorithms often require careful hyperparameter tuning. Before deployment, we need to select amongst a set of candidate policies. However, there is limited understanding about the fundamental limits of this offline policy selection (OPS) problem. In this work we provide clarity on when sample efficient OPS is possible, primarily by connecting OPS to off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) and Bellman error (BE) estimation. We first show a hardness result, that in the worst case, OPS is just as hard as OPE, by proving a reduction of OPE to OPS. As a result, no OPS method can be more sample efficient than OPE in the worst case. We then connect BE estimation to the OPS problem, showing how BE can be used as a tool for OPS. While BE-based methods generally require stronger requirements than OPE, when those conditions are met they can be more sample efficient. Building on this insight, we propose a BE method for OPS, called Identifiable BE Selection (IBES), that has a straightforward method for selecting its own hyperparameters. We conclude with an empirical study comparing OPE and IBES, and by showing the difficulty of OPS on an offline Atari benchmark dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Liu, Zirui Zhu, Chaoyu Gong, Minhao Cheng, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Yang You</p>
<p>Abstract: While fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks often yields impressive results, it comes at the cost of memory inefficiency due to back-propagation in gradient-based training. Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) optimizers, recently proposed to address this issue, only require forward passes during training, making them more memory-friendly. However, compared with exact gradients, ZO-based gradients usually exhibit an estimation error, which can significantly hurt the optimization process, leading to slower convergence and suboptimal solutions. In addition, we find that the estimation error will hurt more when adding to large weights instead of small weights. Based on this observation, this paper introduces Sparse MeZO, a novel memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization approach that applies ZO only to a carefully chosen subset of parameters. We propose a simple yet effective parameter selection scheme that yields significant performance gains with Sparse-MeZO. Additionally, we develop a memory-optimized implementation for sparse masking, ensuring the algorithm requires only inference-level memory consumption, allowing Sparse-MeZO to fine-tune LLaMA-30b on a single A100 GPU. Experimental results illustrate that Sparse-MeZO consistently improves both performance and convergence speed over MeZO without any overhead. For example, it achieves a 9\% absolute accuracy improvement and 3.5x speedup over MeZO on the RTE task. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/SparseMeZO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Sanyal, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Sujay Sanghavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their performance, but we uncover a significant structural inefficiency: a phenomenon we term attention collapse. In many pre-trained decoder-style LLMs, the attention matrices in deeper layers degenerate, collapsing to near rank-one structures. These underutilized layers, which we call lazy layers, are redundant and impair model efficiency. To address this, we introduce Inheritune, a simple yet powerful training recipe designed to build smaller, stronger language models. Inheritune initializes a compact model by inheriting the potent early layers from a larger pre-trained model and then progressively trains and expands it. Our experiments on various models, including the GPT-2 family, demonstrate that models trained with Inheritune can match or even surpass the performance of their larger counterparts, despite having significantly fewer layers. This work presents a novel path toward model compression by design, enabling the creation of compact, yet highly performant language models.

<p>Abstract: A data-driven inverse optimization problem (DDIOP) seeks to estimate an objective function (i.e., weights) that is consistent with observed optimal-solution data, and is important in many applications, including those involving mixed integer linear programs (MILPs). In the DDIOP for MILPs, the prediction loss on features (PLF), defined as the discrepancy between observed and predicted feature values, becomes discontinuous with respect to the weights, which makes it difficult to apply gradient-based optimization. To address this issue, we focus on a Lipschitz continuous and convex suboptimality loss. By exploiting its convex and piecewise-linear structure and the interiority of the minimum set, we show that a broad class of gradient-based optimization methods, including projected subgradient descent (PSGD), reaches the minimum suboptimality loss value in a finite number of iterations, thereby exactly solving the DDIOP for MILPs. Furthermore, as a corollary, we show that PSGD attains the minimum PLF in finitely many iterations. We also derive an upper bound on the number of iterations required for PSGD to reach finite convergence, and confirm the finite-step behavior through numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Castri, Gloria Beraldo, Sariah Mghames, Marc Hanheide, Nicola Bellotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying robots in human-shared environments requires a deep understanding of how nearby agents and objects interact. Employing causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships facilitates the prediction of human behaviours and enables the anticipation of robot interventions. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of implementation of existing causal discovery methods within the ROS ecosystem, the standard de-facto framework in robotics, hindering effective utilisation on real robots. To bridge this gap, in our previous work we proposed ROS-Causal, a ROS-based framework designed for onboard data collection and causal discovery in human-robot spatial interactions. In this work, we present an experimental evaluation of ROS-Causal both in simulation and on a new dataset of human-robot spatial interactions in a lab scenario, to assess its performance and effectiveness. Our analysis demonstrates the efficacy of this approach, showcasing how causal models can be extracted directly onboard by robots during data collection. The online causal models generated from the simulation are consistent with those from lab experiments. These findings can help researchers to enhance the performance of robotic systems in shared environments, firstly by studying the causal relations between variables in simulation without real people, and then facilitating the actual robot deployment in real human environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenghui Li, Fanghua Ye, Meng Fang, Jiaxu Zhao, Yun-Hin Chan, Edith C. H. Ngai, Thiemo Voigt</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been reshaped by the emergence of Foundation Models (FMs). Pre-trained on massive datasets, these models exhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks through adaptation techniques like fine-tuning and prompt learning. More recently, the synergy of FMs and Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, often termed Federated Foundation Models (FedFM), allowing for collaborative model adaptation while preserving data privacy. This survey paper provides a systematic review of the current state of the art in FedFM, offering insights and guidance into the evolving landscape. Specifically, we present a comprehensive multi-tiered taxonomy based on three major dimensions, namely efficiency, adaptability, and trustworthiness. To facilitate practical implementation and experimental research, we undertake a thorough review of existing libraries and benchmarks. Furthermore, we discuss the diverse real-world applications of this paradigm across multiple domains. Finally, we outline promising research directions to foster future advancements in FedFM. Overall, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a thorough understanding of FedFM's role in revolutionizing privacy-preserving AI and pointing toward future innovations in this promising area.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyuan Ye, Bei Ouyang, Tianyi Qian, Liekang Zeng, Jingyi Li, Jiangsu Du, Xiaowen Chu, Guoliang Xing, Xu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaomin Wu, Jizhou Guo, Junyi Hou, Bingsheng He, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prominent Large Language Model (LLM) services from providers like OpenAI and Google excel at general tasks but often underperform on domain-specific applications. Current customization services for these LLMs typically require users to upload data for fine-tuning, posing significant privacy risks. While differentially private (DP) data synthesis presents a potential alternative, its application commonly results in low effectiveness due to the introduction of excessive noise on data for DP. To overcome this, we introduce Llamdex, a novel framework that facilitates LLM customization as a service, where the client uploads pre-trained domain-specific models rather than data. This client-uploaded model, optionally protected by DP with much lower noise, is inserted into the base LLM via connection modules. Significantly, these connecting modules are trained without requiring sensitive domain data, enabling clients to customize LLM services while preserving data privacy. Experiments demonstrate that Llamdex improves domain-specific accuracy by up to 26% over state-of-the-art private data synthesis methods under identical privacy constraints and, by obviating the need for users to provide domain context within queries, maintains inference efficiency comparable to the original LLM service.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gene Yu, Ce Guo, Wayne Luk</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series causal discovery is essential for understanding dynamic systems, yet many existing methods remain sensitive to noise, non-stationarity, and sampling variability. We propose the Validated Consensus-Driven Framework (VCDF), a simple and method-agnostic layer that improves robustness by evaluating the stability of causal relations across blocked temporal subsets. VCDF requires no modification to base algorithms and can be applied to methods such as VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above. Evaluations on simulated fMRI data and IT-monitoring scenarios further demonstrate enhanced stability and structural accuracy under realistic noise conditions. VCDF provides an effective reliability layer for time series causal discovery without altering underlying modeling assumptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a \textbf{one-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only consistent speed-up on LLM pretraining, but also image classification, with minimum extra tuning on hyperparameters.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00686">LVLM-COUNT: Enhancing the Counting Ability of Large Vision-Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Fetrat Qharabagh, Mohammadreza Ghofrani, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Counting is a fundamental operation for various real-world visual tasks, requiring both object recognition and robust counting capabilities. Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) are known to struggle with counting tasks. In this work, we evaluate the performance of several LVLMs on visual counting tasks across multiple counting and vision datasets. We observe that while their performance may be less prone to error for small numbers of objects, they exhibit significant weaknesses as the number of objects increases. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective baseline method that enhances LVLMs' counting ability for large numbers of objects using a divide-and-conquer approach. Our method decomposes counting problems into sub-tasks. Moreover, it incorporates a mechanism to prevent objects from being split during division, which could otherwise lead to repetitive counting -- a common issue in a naive divide-and-conquer implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and benchmarks, establishing it as a valuable reference for evaluating future solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nianze Tao, Minori Abe</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for de novo drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network, especially ChemBFN model, is capable of intrinsically generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. A reinforcement learning strategy is added to the ChemBFN and a controllable ordinary differential equation solver-like generating process is employed that accelerate the sampling processes. Most importantly, we introduce a semi-autoregressive strategy during training and inference that enhances the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models. A theoretical analysis of out-of-distribution generation in ChemBFN with semi-autoregressive approach is included as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Cui, Zhaoyi Li, Xiaochen Ma, Xinyue Bi, Yaxin Luo, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact yet representative dataset that preserves the essential characteristics of the original data for efficient model training. Existing methods mainly focus on improving data-synthetic alignment or scaling distillation to large datasets. In this work, we propose $\textbf{C}$ommittee $\textbf{V}$oting for $\textbf{D}$ataset $\textbf{D}$istillation ($\textbf{CV-DD}$), an orthogonal approach that leverages the collective knowledge of multiple models to produce higher-quality distilled data. We first establish a strong baseline that achieves state-of-the-art performance through modern architectural and optimization choices. By integrating distributions and predictions from multiple models and generating high-quality soft labels, our method captures a broader range of data characteristics, reduces model-specific bias and the impact of distribution shifts, and significantly improves generalization. This voting-based strategy enhances diversity and robustness, alleviates overfitting, and improves post-evaluation performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and IPC settings demonstrate that CV-DD consistently outperforms single- and multi-model distillation methods and generalizes well to non-training-based frameworks and challenging synthetic-to-real transfer tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Errica, Henrik Christiansen, Viktor Zaverkin, Mathias Niepert, Francesco Alesiani</p>
<p>Abstract: For almost 70 years, researchers have typically selected the width of neural networks' layers either manually or through automated hyperparameter tuning methods such as grid search and, more recently, neural architecture search. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The method jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via standard backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, text, sequences, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. A by product of our width learning approach is the easy truncation of the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network until performances do not degrade. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, requiring billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to huge training costs, our approach introduces a viable alternative for width learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Purificato, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Anil Kumar Nelakanti, Andrea Bacciu, Fabrizio Silvestri, Amin Mantrach</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliably labelling data typically requires annotations from multiple human workers. However, humans are far from being perfect. Hence, it is a common practice to aggregate labels gathered from multiple annotators to make a more confident estimate of the true label. Among many aggregation methods, the simple and well known Majority Vote (MV) selects the class label polling the highest number of votes. However, despite its importance, the optimality of MV's label aggregation has not been extensively studied. We address this gap in our work by characterising the conditions under which MV achieves the theoretically optimal lower bound on label estimation error. Our results capture the tolerable limits on annotation noise under which MV can optimally recover labels for a given class distribution. This certificate of optimality provides a more principled approach to model selection for label aggregation as an alternative to otherwise inefficient practices that sometimes include higher experts, gold labels, etc., that are all marred by the same human uncertainty despite huge time and monetary costs. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Deng, Han Zhong, Rui Ai, Fuli Feng, Zheng Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To further mitigate the noise in different reward models, we propose a Bayesian Aggregation approach that unifies multiple margin sources (external and implicit) into a single preference probability. Extensive experiments in diverse settings demonstrate the consistently high data efficiency of our approach. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama, Mistral, and Qwen models on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, revealing the high redundancy in this presumed high-quality data construction manner. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Nakatani (SecDevLab Inc.)</p>
<p>Abstract: We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses
  the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior
  approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen
  leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from
  a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented
  knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop
  (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted
  exploits in a fully automated manner.
  In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell
  access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a
  60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential
  of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations
  without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities,
  while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges.
  Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient,
  thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Hickling, Maxwell Hogan, Abdulla Tammam, Nabil Aouf</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the first end-to-end framework that combines guidance, navigation, and centralised task allocation for multiple UAVs performing autonomous search-and-rescue (SAR) in GNSS-denied indoor environments. A Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient controller is trained with an Artificial Potential Field (APF) reward that blends attractive and repulsive potentials with continuous control, accelerating convergence and yielding smoother, safer trajectories than distance-only baselines. Collaborative mission assignment is solved by a deep Graph Attention Network that, at each decision step, reasons over the drone-task graph to produce near-optimal allocations with negligible on-board compute. To arrest the notorious Z-drift of indoor LiDAR-SLAM, we fuse depth-camera altimetry with IMU vertical velocity in a lightweight complementary filter, giving centimetre-level altitude stability without external beacons. The resulting system was deployed on two 1m-class quad-rotors and flight-tested in a cluttered, multi-level disaster mock-up designed for the NATO-Sapience Autonomous Cooperative Drone Competition. Compared with prior DRL guidance that remains largely in simulation, our framework demonstrates an ability to navigate complex indoor environments, securing first place in the 2024 event. These results demonstrate that APF-shaped DRL and GAT-driven cooperation can translate to reliable real-world SAR operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharan Mourya, Hannes Leipold, Bibhas Adhikari</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we apply quantum machine learning (QML) to predict the stock prices of multiple assets using a contextual quantum neural network. Our approach captures recent trends to predict future stock price distributions, moving beyond traditional models that focus on entire historical data, enhancing adaptability and precision. Utilizing the principles of quantum superposition, we introduce a new training technique called the quantum batch gradient update (QBGU), which accelerates the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in quantum applications and improves convergence. Consequently, we propose a quantum multi-task learning (QMTL) architecture, specifically, the share-and-specify ansatz, that integrates task-specific operators controlled by quantum labels, enabling the simultaneous and efficient training of multiple assets on the same quantum circuit as well as enabling efficient portfolio representation with logarithmic overhead in the number of qubits. This architecture represents the first of its kind in quantum finance, offering superior predictive power and computational efficiency for multi-asset stock price forecasting. Through extensive experimentation on S\&P 500 data for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon stocks, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms quantum single-task learning (QSTL) models but also effectively captures inter-asset correlations, leading to enhanced prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of QML in financial applications, paving the way for more advanced, resource-efficient quantum algorithms in stock price prediction and other complex financial modeling tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p>

RMOD formulates the robust decoding problem as a maximin two-player game between adversarially computed reward weights and the sampling policy, solvable through a Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate that this game reduces to a convex optimization problem to identify the worst-case reward weights, with the optimal sampling policy analytically derived. For practical applications, we propose an efficient algorithm of RMOD tailored for contemporary LLMs, introducing minimal computational overhead compared to standard non-robust Controlled Decoding methods. Experimental results across a range of popular alignment datasets with up to 10 objectives show the effectiveness of RMOD and its distilled version, consistently outperforming baselines in worst-case rewards and win rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyue Qin, Shichang Zhang, Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prothit Sen, Sai Mihir Jakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: We formalize AI-human collaboration through an agent-based simulation that distinguishes optimization-based AI search from satisficing-based human adaptation. Using an NK model, we examine how these distinct decision heuristics interact across modular and sequenced task structures. For modular tasks, AI typically substitutes for humans, yet complementarities emerge when AI explores a moderately broad search space and human task complexity remains low. In sequenced tasks, we uncover a counterintuitive result: when a high-performing human initiates search and AI subsequently refines it, joint performance is maximized, contradicting the dominant AI-first design principle. Conversely, when AI leads and human satisficing follows, complementarities attenuate as task interdependence increases. We further show that memory-less random AI, despite lacking structured adaptation, can improve outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by enabling escape from local optima. Collectively, our findings reveal that effective AI-human collaboration depends less on industry context and more on task architecture: the division of labor, sequencing, and interdependence structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central design principle, we provide a generalizable framework for strategic decision-making involving agentic AI across diverse organizational settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces SecRepoBench, a benchmark to evaluate code agents on secure code completion in real-world repositories. SecRepoBench has 318 code completion tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 29 standalone LLMs and 15 code agents across 3 state-of-the-art agent frameworks using our benchmark. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with generating correct and secure code completions.

Finally, our comprehensive analysis provides insights into potential directions for enhancing the ability of code agents to write correct and secure code in real-world repositories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijit Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Amortized variational inference in latent-variable forecasters creates a deployment gap: the test-time encoder approximates a training-time optimization-refined latent, but without access to future targets. This gap introduces unnecessary forecast error and interpretability challenges. In this work, we propose the Sparse Latent Factor Forecaster with Iterative Inference (SLFF), addressing this through (i) a sparse coding objective with L1 regularization for low-dimensional latents, (ii) unrolled proximal gradient descent (LISTA-style) for iterative refinement during training, and (iii) encoder alignment to ensure amortized outputs match optimization-refined solutions. Under a linearized decoder assumption, we derive a design-motivating bound on the amortization gap based on encoder-optimizer distance, with convergence rates under mild conditions; empirical checks confirm the bound is predictive for the deployed MLP decoder. To prevent mixed-frequency data leakage, we introduce an information-set-aware protocol using release calendars and vintage macroeconomic data. Interpretability is formalized via a three-stage protocol: stability (Procrustes alignment across seeds), driver validity (held-out regressions against observables), and behavioral consistency (counterfactuals and event studies). Using commodity futures (Copper, WTI, Gold; 2005--2025) as a testbed, SLFF demonstrates significant improvements over neural baselines at 1- and 5-day horizons, yielding sparse factors that are stable across seeds and correlated with observable economic fundamentals (interpretability remains correlational, not causal). Code, manifests, diagnostics, and artifacts are released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianrui Zhong, Bowen Jin, Siru Ouyang, Yanzhen Shen, Qiao Jin, Yin Fang, Zhiyong Lu, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, particularly in scientific domains that demand specialized and dynamic information. Despite its promise, the application of RAG in the chemistry domain remains underexplored, primarily due to the lack of high-quality, domain-specific corpora and well-curated evaluation benchmarks. In this work, we introduce ChemRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of RAG across a diverse set of chemistry-related tasks. The accompanying chemistry corpus integrates heterogeneous knowledge sources, including scientific literature, the PubChem database, PubMed abstracts, textbooks, and Wikipedia entries. In addition, we present ChemRAG-Toolkit, a modular and extensible RAG toolkit that supports five retrieval algorithms and eight LLMs. Using ChemRAG-Toolkit, we demonstrate that RAG yields a substantial performance gain -- achieving an average relative improvement of 17.4% over direct inference methods. We further conduct in-depth analyses on retriever architectures, corpus selection, and the number of retrieved passages, culminating in practical recommendations to guide future research and deployment of RAG systems in the chemistry domain.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomasz Szydlo, Viacheslaw Horbanov, Devki Nandan Jha, Shashikant Ilager, Aleksander Slominski, Rajiv Ranjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge computing has emerged as a pivotal technology, offering significant advantages such as low latency, enhanced data security, and reduced reliance on centralized cloud infrastructure. These benefits are crucial for applications requiring real-time data processing or strict security measures. Despite these advantages, edge devices operating within edge clusters are often underutilized. This inefficiency is mainly due to the absence of a holistic performance profiling mechanism which can help dynamically adjust the desired system configuration for a given workload. Since edge computing environments involve a complex interplay between CPU frequency, power consumption, and application performance, a deeper understanding of these correlations is essential. By uncovering these relationships, it becomes possible to make informed decisions that enhance both computational efficiency and energy savings. To address this gap, this paper evaluates the power consumption and performance characteristics of a single processing node within an edge cluster using a synthetic microbenchmark by varying the workload size and CPU frequency. The results show how an optimal measure can lead to optimized usage of edge resources, given both performance and power consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Dong, Bilge Acun, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the reasoning capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shudi Weng, Chao Ren, Ming Xiao, Mikael Skoglund</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) commonly involves clients with diverse communication and computational capabilities. Such heterogeneity can significantly distort the optimization dynamics and lead to objective inconsistency, where the global model converges to an incorrect stationary point potentially far from the pursued optimum. Despite its critical impact, the joint effect of communication and computation heterogeneity has remained largely unexplored, due to the intrinsic complexity of their interaction. In this paper, we reveal the fundamentally distinct mechanisms through which heterogeneous communication and computation drive inconsistency in FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified theoretical analysis of general heterogeneous FL, offering a principled understanding of how these two forms of heterogeneity jointly distort the optimization trajectory under arbitrary choices of local solvers. Motivated by these insights, we propose Federated Heterogeneity-Aware Client Sampling, FedACS, a universal method to eliminate all types of objective inconsistency. We theoretically prove that FedACS converges to the correct optimum at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{R})$, even in dynamic heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FedACS outperforms state-of-the-art and category-specific baselines by 4.3%-36%, while reducing communication costs by 22%-89% and computation loads by 14%-105%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Xu, Ryumei Nakada, Linjun Zhang, Lexin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning has become a central paradigm in modern machine learning, yet it suffers from the long-standing problem of negative transfer, where leveraging source representations can harm rather than help performance on the target task. Although empirical remedies have been proposed, there remains little theoretical understanding of how to reliably avoid negative transfer. In this paper, we investigate a simple yet remarkably effective strategy: augmenting frozen, pretrained source-side features with a trainable target-side encoder that adapts target features to capture residual signals overlooked by models pretrained on the source data. We show this residual feature integration strategy is sufficient to provably prevent negative transfer, by establishing theoretical guarantees that it has no worse convergence rate than training from scratch under the informative class of target distributions up to logarithmic factors, and that the convergence rate can transition seamlessly from nonparametric to near-parametric when source representations are informative. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical work that ensures protection against negative transfer. We carry out extensive numerical experiments across image, text and tabular benchmarks, and empirically verify that the method consistently safeguards performance under distribution shift, label noise, semantic perturbation, and class imbalance. We additionally demonstrate that this residual integration mechanism uniquely supports adapt-time multimodality extension, enabling a pretrained single-cell foundation model to incorporate spatial signals for lymph-node anatomical classification despite the source model being trained without them. Our study thus advances the theory of safe transfer learning, and provides a principled approach that is simple, robust, architecture-agnostic, and broadly applicable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Huang, Tianle Hu, Yu Chen, Zi'ang Li, Jie Wen, Xiaozhao Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single image reflection separation aims to separate the transmission and reflection layers from a mixed image. Existing methods typically combine general priors from pre-trained models with task-specific priors such as text prompts and reflection detection. However, the transmission prior, as the most direct task-specific prior for the target transmission layer, has not been effectively modeled or fully utilized, limiting performance in complex scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prior interaction framework based on lightweight transmission prior generation and effective prior fusion. First, we design a Local Linear Correction Network (LLCN) that finetunes pre-trained models based on the physical constraint T=SI+B, where S and B represent pixel-wise and channel-wise scaling and bias transformations. LLCN efficiently generates high-quality transmission priors with minimal parameters. Second, we construct a Dual-Prior Interaction Transformer (DPIT) that employs a dual-stream channel reorganization attention mechanism. By reorganizing features from general and transmission priors for attention computation, DPIT achieves deep fusion of both priors, fully exploiting their complementary information. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Patil</p>
<p>Abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure, and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks. Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards, highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks, illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alvin Heng, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift, where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines, indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for improving selective classification under covariate shifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongle Huang, Lei Zhu, Zongyuan Zhan, Ting Hu, Weikai Mao, Xianzhi Yu, Yongpan Liu, Tianyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across many applications, with Mixture of Experts (MoE) models demonstrating great potential. Compared to traditional dense models, MoEs achieve better performance with less computation. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to accelerate LLM inference without accuracy loss, but it has been considered efficient only for dense models. In this work, we first demonstrate that, under medium batch sizes, MoE surprisingly benefits more from SD than dense models. Furthermore, as MoE becomes sparser -- the prevailing trend in MoE designs -- the batch size range where SD acceleration is expected to be effective becomes broader. To quantitatively understand tradeoffs involved in SD, we develop a reliable modeling based on theoretical analyses. While current SD research primarily focuses on improving acceptance rates of algorithms, changes in workload and model architecture can still lead to degraded SD acceleration even with high acceptance rates. To address this limitation, we introduce a new metric 'target efficiency' that characterizes these effects, thus helping researchers identify system bottlenecks and understand SD acceleration more comprehensively. For scenarios like private serving, this work unveils a new perspective to speed up MoE inference, where existing solutions struggle. Experiments on different GPUs show up to 2.29x speedup for Qwen2-57B-A14B at medium batch sizes and validate our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Ghanizadeh, Ali Ahmadi, Arash Bahrami</p>
<p>Abstract: The internal structure of the Fin-Ray fingers plays a significant role in their adaptability and grasping performance. However, modeling the grasp force and deformation behavior for design purposes is challenging. When the Fin-Ray finger becomes more rigid and capable of exerting higher forces, it becomes less delicate in handling objects. The contrast between these two gives rise to a multi-objective optimization problem. We employ the finite element method to estimate the deflections and contact forces of the Fin-Ray fingers grasping cylindrical objects, generating a dataset of 120 simulations. This dataset includes three input variables: the thickness of the front and support beams, the thickness of the crossbeams, and the equal spacing between the crossbeams, which are the design variables in the optimization. This dataset is then used to construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with four output neurons predicting the contact force and tip displacement in two directions. The magnitudes of maximum contact force and maximum tip displacement are two optimization objectives, showing the trade-off between force and delicate manipulation. The set of solutions is found using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The results of the simulations demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used to improve the design and grasping performance of soft grippers, aiding to choose a design not only for delicate grasping but also for high-force applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Meyer, Josef Gr\"un, Maximilian Weiherer, Bernhard Egger, Marc Stamminger, Linus Franke</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Franzmeyer, Archie Sravankumar, Lijuan Liu, Yuning Mao, Rui Hou, Sinong Wang, Jakob N. Foerster, Luke Zettlemoyer, Madian Khabsa</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Sun, Jingyan Shen, Yibin Wang, Tianyu Chen, Zhendong Wang, Mingyuan Zhou, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Liu, Jiaqi Li, Zilong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Rule-based reasoning is acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems of reasoning. While recent studies show that large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL), real applications still face severe challenges due to variations in rule formats, types, and complexity. To mitigate this issue, we introduce RuleReasoner, an effective method for rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel domain-aware dynamic sampling approach in RL. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples each training batch by updating the domain weights based on historical rewards. This facilitates domain balance and active learning schedules for RL, obviating static mix-training engineered by human. Evaluations on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1% on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% on three OOD tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to prior methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boya Xiong, Shuo Wang, Weifeng Ge, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with exceptional performance on specialized tasks, but it yields dense, high-dimensional delta parameters that pose severe storage and distribution challenges. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression offers a compact representation for such delta parameters, but existing methods adopt heuristic quantization without clarifying underlying mechanisms, leading to poor generalizability. In this work, we propose PrinMix, a rigorous SVD-based framework that models quantization as an optimization problem, grounding the design in mathematical mechanisms. We first theoretically derive quantization error and identify a key singular-value-dominated scaling mechanism, which mathematically proves the necessity of mix-precision quantization. We then model the quantization scheme as a 0/1 Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem, which yields optimal bit-budget-constrained solutions without empirical assumptions. Furthermore, PrinMix integrates a Reconstruction Target Correction (RTC) method to compensate for errors from the $\mathbf{V}$-then-$\mathbf{U}$ sequential quantization process. Extensive experiments confirm PrinMix performs well: for 7B LLMs, PrinMix outperforms SOTA Delta-CoMe on challenging benchmarks by 22.3% on AIME2024 and 6.1% on GQA.</p>

<p>Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyue Huang, Mikhail Galkin, Michael M. Bronstein, \.Ismail \.Ilkan Ceylan</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs is the task of predicting missing hyperedges involving completely novel entities (i.e., nodes unseen during training). Existing methods for inductive link prediction with knowledge hypergraphs assume a fixed relational vocabulary and, as a result, cannot generalize to knowledge hypergraphs with novel relation types (i.e., relations unseen during training). Inspired by knowledge graph foundation models, we propose HYPER as a foundation model for link prediction, which can generalize to any knowledge hypergraph, including novel entities and novel relations. Importantly, HYPER can learn and transfer across different relation types of varying arities, by encoding the entities of each hyperedge along with their respective positions in the hyperedge. To evaluate HYPER, we construct 16 new inductive datasets from existing knowledge hypergraphs, covering a diverse range of relation types of varying arities. Empirically, HYPER consistently outperforms all existing methods in both node-only and node-and-relation inductive settings, showing strong generalization to unseen, higher-arity relational structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Pei, Jing-Xiao Liao, Qibin Zhao, Ting Gao, Shijun Zhang, Xiaoge Zhang, Feng-Lei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression (SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Rare diseases affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains an urgent challenge. Patients often endure a prolonged diagnostic odyssey exceeding five years, marked by repeated referrals, misdiagnoses, and unnecessary interventions, leading to delayed treatment and substantial emotional and economic burdens. Here we present DeepRare, a multi-agent system for rare disease differential diagnosis decision support powered by large language models, integrating over 40 specialized tools and up-to-date knowledge sources. DeepRare processes heterogeneous clinical inputs, including free-text descriptions, structured Human Phenotype Ontology terms, and genetic testing results, to generate ranked diagnostic hypotheses with transparent reasoning linked to verifiable medical evidence. Evaluated across nine datasets from literature, case reports and clinical centres across Asia, North America and Europe spanning 14 medical specialties, DeepRare demonstrates exceptional performance on 3,134 diseases. In human-phenotype-ontology-based tasks, it achieves an average Recall@1 of 57.18%, outperforming the next-best method by 23.79%; in multi-modal tests, it reaches 69.1% compared with Exomiser's 55.9% on 168 cases. Expert review achieved 95.4% agreement on its reasoning chains, confirming their validity and traceability. Our work not only advances rare disease diagnosis but also demonstrates how the latest powerful large-language-model-driven agentic systems can reshape current clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Merizzi, Harilaos Loukos</p>
<p>Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are critical for simulating large-scale climate dynamics, but their coarse spatial resolution limits their applicability in regional studies. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) address this limitation through dynamical downscaling, albeit at considerable computational cost and with limited flexibility. Deep learning has emerged as an efficient data-driven alternative; however, most existing approaches focus on single-variable models that downscale one variable at a time. This paradigm can lead to redundant computation, limited contextual awareness, and weak cross-variable interactions.To address these limitations, we propose a multi-variable Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with a shared encoder and variable-specific decoders (1EMD). The proposed model jointly predicts six key climate variables: surface temperature, wind speed, 500 hPa geopotential height, total precipitation, surface downwelling shortwave radiation, and surface downwelling longwave radiation, directly from GCM-resolution inputs, emulating RCM-scale downscaling over Europe. Compared to single-variable ViT models, the 1EMD architecture improves performance across all six variables, achieving an average MSE reduction of approximately 5.5% under a fair and controlled comparison. It also consistently outperforms alternative multi-variable baselines, including a single-decoder ViT and a multi-variable U-Net. Moreover, multi-variable models substantially reduce computational cost, yielding a 29-32% lower inference time per variable compared to single-variable approaches. Overall, our results demonstrate that multi-variable modeling provides systematic advantages for high-resolution climate downscaling in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Among the evaluated architectures, the proposed 1EMD ViT achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Sato, Kazuhiko Kawamoto, Hiroshi Kera</p>
<p>Abstract: The chain of thought, i.e., step-by-step reasoning, is one of the fundamental mechanisms of Transformers. While the design of intermediate reasoning steps has been extensively studied and shown to critically influence performance on mathematical, multi-step reasoning tasks, the ordering of these steps has received little attention, despite its significant effect on the difficulty of reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling the chain of thought -- reordering decoder input tokens into a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers, for learning arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially in sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on seven order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies for the multiplication task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglun Kong, Mufan Qiu, John Boesen, Xiang Lin, Sukwon Yun, Tianlong Chen, Manolis Kellis, Marinka Zitnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial context jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology. Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but existing methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem by introducing SPATIA, a multi-level generative and predictive model that learns unified, spatially aware representations by fusing morphology, gene expression, and spatial context from the cell to the tissue level. SPATIA also incorporates a novel spatially conditioned generative framework for predicting cell morphologies under perturbations. Specifically, we propose a confidence-aware flow matching objective that reweights weak optimal-transport pairs based on uncertainty. We further apply morphology-profile alignment to encourage biologically meaningful image generation, enabling the modeling of microenvironment-dependent phenotypic transitions. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 25.9 million cell-gene pairs across 17 tissues. We benchmark SPATIA against 18 models across 12 tasks, spanning categories such as phenotype generation, annotation, clustering, gene imputation, and cross-modal prediction. SPATIA achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art models, improving generative fidelity by 8% and predictive accuracy by up to 3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohang Tang, Rares Dolga, Sangwoong Yoon, Ilija Bogunovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead, and can lead to large variance and estimation error in RL objective -- particularly in computing the policy ratio for importance sampling. To mitigate these issues, we introduce wd1, a novel ratio-free policy optimization approach that reformulates the RL objective as a weighted log-likelihood, requiring only a single approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. We formally show that our proposed method can be interpreted as energy-guided discrete diffusion training combined with negative sample unlearning, thereby confirming its theoretical soundness. In experiments on LLaDA-8B model, wd1 outperforms diffusion-based GRPO (d1) while requiring lower computational cost, achieving up to a $+59\%$ improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, we extend wd1 to denoising-stepwise weighted policy optimization (wd1++), achieving state-of-the-art math performance of $44.2\%$ on MATH500 and $84.5\%$ on GSM8K with only 20 RL training steps.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14186">A Disentangled Representation Learning Framework for Low-altitude Network Coverage Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojie Li, Zhijie Cai, Nan Qi, Chao Dong, Guangxu Zhu, Haixia Ma, Qihui Wu, Shi Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors. While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB level.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaixian Qu, Guowei Lan, Ren\'e Zurbr\"ugg, Changan Chen, Christopher E. Mower, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Marco Hutter</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as the dominant paradigm for robotic task planning using natural language instructions. However, trained on general internet data, LLMs are not inherently aligned with the embodiment, skill sets, and limitations of real-world robotic systems. Inspired by the emerging paradigm of verbal reinforcement learning-where LLM agents improve through self-reflection and few-shot learning without parameter updates-we introduce PragmaBot, a framework that enables robots to learn task planning through real-world experience. PragmaBot employs a vision-language model (VLM) as the robot's "brain" and "eye", allowing it to visually evaluate action outcomes and self-reflect on failures. These reflections are stored in a short-term memory (STM), enabling the robot to quickly adapt its behavior during ongoing tasks. Upon task completion, the robot summarizes the lessons learned into its long-term memory (LTM). When facing new tasks, it can leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to plan more grounded action sequences by drawing on relevant past experiences and knowledge. Experiments on four challenging robotic tasks show that STM-based self-reflection increases task success rates from 35% to 84%, with emergent intelligent object interactions. In 12 real-world scenarios (including eight previously unseen tasks), the robot effectively learns from the LTM and improves single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, with RAG outperforming naive prompting. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of PragmaBot. Project webpage: https://pragmabot.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Resource allocation (RA) is critical to efficient service deployment in Network Function Virtualization (NFV), a transformative networking paradigm. Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing promising potential to address this complexity. However, the lack of a systematic benchmarking framework and thorough analysis hinders the exploration of emerging networks and the development of more robust algorithms while causing inconsistent evaluation. In this paper, we introduce Virne, a comprehensive benchmarking framework for the NFV-RA problem, with a focus on supporting deep RL-based methods. Virne provides customizable simulations for diverse network scenarios, including cloud, edge, and 5G environments. It also features a modular and extensible implementation pipeline that supports over 30 methods of various types, and includes practical evaluation perspectives beyond effectiveness, such as scalability, generalization, and scalability. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions. Overall, with its diverse simulations, rich implementations, and extensive evaluation capabilities, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language often provides a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared to policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across six tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 6% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% (e.g., +12% accuracy on AIME-2025), and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Liu, Siru Ouyang, Xianrui Zhong, Jiawei Han, Huimin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.</p>

This paper proposes to integrate SCE into Breach Attack Simulation (BAS) platforms, leveraging adversary profiles and abilities from existing threat intelligence databases. This innovative proposal for cyberattack simulation employs a structured architecture composed of three layers: SCE Orchestrator, Connector, and BAS layers. Utilizing MITRE Caldera in the BAS layer, our proposal executes automated attack sequences, creating inferred attack trees from adversary profiles. Our proposal evaluation illustrates how integrating SCE with BAS can enhance the effectiveness of attack simulations beyond traditional scenarios, and be a useful component of a cyber defense strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaomin Wu, Mingzhe Du, See-Kiong Ng, Bingsheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness critical. A significant and underexplored risk is intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective. Existing studies typically induce deception by explicitly setting a hidden objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond such human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth, we propose a framework based on Contact Searching Questions~(CSQ). This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias toward a hidden objective. The second, the Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Evaluating 16 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics rise in parallel and escalate with task difficulty for most models. Moreover, increasing model capacity does not always reduce deception, posing a significant challenge for future LLM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Sultanul Arifin, Abu Nowshed Sakib, Yeasir Rayhan, Tanzima Hashem</p>
<p>Abstract: Lightning, a common feature of severe meteorological conditions, poses significant risks, from direct human injuries to substantial economic losses. These risks are further exacerbated by climate change. Early and accurate prediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people, protect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present DeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning occurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: i) they often struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and the inherent randomness of lightning events, including whether lightning occurs and its variability in location and timing even under similar meteorological conditions; ii) they underutilize key observational data, such as radar reflectivity and cloud properties; and iii) they rely heavily on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly sensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight leverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud properties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder architecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically captures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel Hazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of lightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling the model to better learn patterns amidst randomness. Extensive experiments show that DeepLight improves the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) by 18\%--30\% over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a robust solution for lightning prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artzai Picon, Itziar Eguskiza, Daniel Mugica, Javier Romero, Carlos Javier Jimenez, Eric White, Gabriel Do-Lago-Junqueira, Christian Klukas, Ramon Navarra-Mestre</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable plant species and damage segmentation for herbicide field research trials requires models that can withstand substantial real-world variation across seasons, geographies, devices, and sensing modalities. Most deep learning approaches trained on controlled datasets fail to generalize under these domain shifts, limiting their suitability for operational phenotyping pipelines. This study evaluates a segmentation framework that integrates vision foundation models (DINOv2) with hierarchical taxonomic inference to improve robustness across heterogeneous agricultural conditions. We train on a large, multi-year dataset collected in Germany and Spain (2018-2020), comprising 14 plant species and 4 herbicide damage classes, and assess generalization under increasingly challenging shifts: temporal and device changes (2023), geographic transfer to the United States, and extreme sensor shift to drone imagery (2024). Results show that the foundation-model backbone consistently outperforms prior baselines, improving species-level F1 from 0.52 to 0.87 on in-distribution data and maintaining significant advantages under moderate (0.77 vs. 0.24) and extreme (0.44 vs. 0.14) shift conditions. Hierarchical inference provides an additional layer of robustness, enabling meaningful predictions even when fine-grained species classification degrades (family F1: 0.68, class F1: 0.88 on aerial imagery). Error analysis reveals that failures under severe shift stem primarily from vegetation-soil confusion, suggesting that taxonomic distinctions remain preserved despite background and viewpoint variability. The system is now deployed within BASF's phenotyping workflow for herbicide research trials across multiple regions, illustrating the practical viability of combining foundation models with structured biological hierarchies for scalable, shift-resilient agricultural monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura L\"utzow, Michael Eichelbeck, Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Matthias Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that augments a base predictor to return sets of predictions with statistically valid coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishikesh Devanathan, Varun Nathan, Ayush Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is increasingly critical for contact centers, where privacy constraints and data scarcity limit the availability of real conversations. However, generating synthetic dialogues that are realistic and useful for downstream applications remains challenging. In this work, we benchmark multiple generation strategies guided by structured supervision on call attributes (Intent Summaries, Topic Flows, and Quality Assurance (QA) Forms) across multiple languages. To test downstream utility, we evaluate synthetic transcripts on an automated quality assurance (AutoQA) task, finding that prompts optimized on real transcripts consistently outperform those optimized on synthetic transcripts. These results suggest that current synthetic transcripts fall short in capturing the full realism of real agent-customer interactions. To highlight these downstream gaps, we introduce a diagnostic evaluation framework comprising 17 metrics across four dimensions: (1) Emotional and Sentiment Arcs, (2) Linguistic Complexity, (3) Interaction Style, and (4) Conversational Properties. Our analysis shows that even with structured supervision, current generation strategies exhibit measurable deficiencies in sentiment fidelity, disfluency modeling, behavioral variation, and conversational realism. Together, these results highlight the importance of diagnostic, metric-driven evaluation for synthetic conversation generation intended for downstream applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulated environments have proven invaluable in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) where Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can be trained without the computational overhead of emulation. These environments must accurately represent cybersecurity scenarios while producing the necessary signals to support RL training. In this study, we present a framework where we first extend CybORG's Cage Challenge 2 environment by implementing three new actions: Patch, Isolate, and Unisolate, to better represent the capabilities available to human operators in real-world settings. We then propose a design for agent development where we modify the reward signals and the agent's feature space to enhance training performance. To validate these modifications, we train DQN and PPO agents in the updated environment. Our study demonstrates that CybORG can be extended with additional realistic functionality, while maintaining its ability to generate informative training signals for RL agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cunmin Zhao, Ziyuan Luo, Guoye Guan, Zelin Li, Yiming Ma, Zhongying Zhao, Renjie Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: 4D live fluorescence microscopy is often compromised by prolonged high intensity illumination which induces photobleaching and phototoxic effects that generate photo-induced artifacts and severely impair image continuity and detail recovery. To address this challenge, we propose the CellINR framework, a case-specific optimization approach based on implicit neural representation. The method employs blind convolution and structure amplification strategies to map 3D spatial coordinates into the high frequency domain, enabling precise modeling and high-accuracy reconstruction of cellular structures while effectively distinguishing true signals from artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that CellINR significantly outperforms existing techniques in artifact removal and restoration of structural continuity, and for the first time, a paired 4D live cell imaging dataset is provided for evaluating reconstruction performance, thereby offering a solid foundation for subsequent quantitative analyses and biological research. The code and dataset will be public.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan" large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent, lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun Basandrai, Shourya Jain, K. Ilanthenral</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority. These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous decision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through direct environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute undesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate external knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on cybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed decisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline performance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative outcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity environment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher rewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately 4,500 episodes faster than the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Zimmer, Oswaldo Luiz do Valle Costa</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing adaptive and data-driven strategies, enabling market makers to optimize decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book environment. This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning agent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics have been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets, including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility. These mechanisms aim to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Carlesso, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data difficulty during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phillipe R. Sampaio</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of finding $\varepsilon$-Pareto stationary points in smooth multiobjective optimization with $m$ objectives. Progress is measured by the Pareto stationarity gap $\mathcal{G}(x)$, the norm of the best convex combination of objective gradients. Our analysis relies on a non-degenerate lifting that embeds hard single-objective instances into MOO instances with distinct objectives and non-singleton Pareto fronts while preserving lower bounds on $\mathcal{G}$. We establish: (i) in the $\mu$-strongly convex case, any span first-order method has worst-case linear convergence no faster than $\exp(-\Theta(T/\sqrt{\kappa}))$ after $T$ oracle calls, yielding $\Theta(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations and matching accelerated upper bounds; (ii) in the convex case, an $\Omega(1/T)$ min-iterate lower bound for oblivious one-step methods and a universal last-iterate lower bound $\Omega(1/T^2)$ for oblivious span methods via polynomial-degree arguments, and we further show this latter bound is loose (for general adaptive methods) by importing geometric lower bounds to obtain an $\Omega(1/T)$ min-iterate lower bound for general adaptive first-order methods; (iii) in the nonconvex case with $L$-Lipschitz gradients, an $\Omega(\sqrt{L}/(T+1))$-type lower bound on $\mathcal{G}$ (tight in order), implying $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations to reach $\mathcal{G}(x)\le\varepsilon$ up to natural scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Huayu Chen, Haotian Ye, Haoxiang Wang, Qinsheng Zhang, Kai Jiang, Hang Su, Stefano Ermon, Jun Zhu, Ming-Yu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models obtain extensive capabilities through pre-training. However, the pre-training process remains a black box. In this work, we track linear interpretable feature evolution across pre-training snapshots using a sparse dictionary learning method called crosscoders. We find that most features begin to form around a specific point, while more complex patterns emerge in later training stages. Feature attribution analyses reveal causal connections between feature evolution and downstream performance. Our feature-level observations are highly consistent with previous findings on Transformer's two-stage learning process, which we term a statistical learning phase and a feature learning phase. Our work opens up the possibility to track fine-grained representation progress during language model learning dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intelligent systems have traditionally been designed as tools rather than collaborators, often lacking critical characteristics that collaboration partnerships require. Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents open new opportunities for human-LLM-agent collaboration by enabling natural communication and various social and cognitive behaviors. Yet it remains unclear whether principles of computer-mediated collaboration established in HCI and CSCW persist, change, or fail when humans collaborate with LLM agents. To support systematic investigations of these questions, we introduce an open and configurable research platform for HCI researchers. The platform's modular design allows seamless adaptation of classic CSCW experiments and manipulation of theory-grounded interaction controls. We demonstrate the platform's research efficacy and usability through three case studies: (1) two Shape Factory experiments for resource negotiation with 16 participants, (2) one Hidden Profile experiment for information pooling with 16 participants, and (3) a participatory cognitive walkthrough with five HCI researchers to refine workflows of researcher interface for experiment setup and analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark features a five-level, cognition-oriented evaluation framework (i.e., Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application). Based on the framework, 23 representative evaluation tasks were defined. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an "LLM-as-a-Judge" approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 1-13%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, demonstrates a comparable harmful potential. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression) rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and differentially private. We propose a noisy two-stage gradient descent algorithm that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among optimization, privacy, and sampling error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy trade-offs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Shen, Basileal Imana, Tong Wu, Chong Xiang, Prateek Mittal, Aleksandra Korolova</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO.
  Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents.
  Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a "consistent majority" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents.
  We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaomin Wu, Haodong Zhao, Ziyang Wang, Jizhou Guo, Qian Wang, Bingsheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional, bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable, training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Zhang, Zehua Chen, Kaiwen Zheng, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Bridge models have been investigated in speech enhancement but are mostly single-task, with constrained general speech restoration (GSR) capability. In this work, we propose VoiceBridge, a one-step latent bridge model (LBM) for GSR, capable of efficiently reconstructing 48 kHz fullband speech from diverse distortions. To inherit the advantages of data-domain bridge models, we design an energy-preserving variational autoencoder, enhancing the waveform-latent space alignment over varying energy levels. By compressing waveform into continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models~\textit{various} GSR tasks with a~\textit{single} latent-to-latent generative process backed by a scalable transformer. To alleviate the challenge of reconstructing the high-quality target from distinctively different low-quality priors, we propose a joint neural prior for GSR, uniformly reducing the burden of the LBM in diverse tasks. Building upon these designs, we further investigate bridge training objective by jointly tuning LBM, decoder and discriminator together, transforming the model from a denoiser to generator and enabling \textit{one-step GSR without distillation}. Extensive validation across in-domain (\textit{e.g.}, denoising and super-resolution) and out-of-domain tasks (\textit{e.g.}, refining synthesized speech) and datasets demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Xu, Xunzhi He, Churan Zhi, Ruizhe Chen, Julian McAuley, Zexue He</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs) use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types. We release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed for bias mitigation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Shen, Mufei Li, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied agents creates an urgent need to measure their privacy awareness in the physical world. Existing evaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\% accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore, when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion over the constraint in up to 86\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\% of the time. These findings, demonstrated by our benchmark, underscore a fundamental misalignment in LLMs regarding physically grounded privacy and establish the need for more robust, physically-aware alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yukun Zhang, Xueqing Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers enable powerful content-based global routing via self-attention, but they lack an explicit local geometric prior along the sequence axis. As a result, the placement of locality-inducing modules in hybrid architectures has largely been empirical. We study a simple deterministic PDE diffusion layer implemented as one explicit Euler step of one-dimensional heat smoothing using a discrete Neumann Laplacian under a spectral stability constraint, and ask a structural question: where should diffusion be inserted relative to attention? Our central claim is that diffusion and attention generally do not commute, so inserting the same local operator before versus after attention leads to qualitatively different behaviors. We develop a three-layer operator-theoretic framework that (1) establishes unconditional guarantees for the diffusion subsystem, including spectral non-expansiveness and monotone Dirichlet-energy dissipation when the diffusion step size is smaller than one half, (2) derives compositional perturbation bounds linking insertion effects to representation roughness and downstream amplification, and (3) uses diffusion-attention non-commutativity as a diagnostic for structural double-mixing conflicts. Guided by theory, we evaluate seven insertion positions on the Long Range Arena benchmark. Early diffusion acts as effective pre-regularization, improving average accuracy by 4.1 percentage points when applied after embedding, while post-attention diffusion degrades performance by 2.5 percentage points, consistent with the predicted conflict. A multi-scale diffusion variant yields consistent gains under the same global stability constraint. Our analysis provides a general template for reasoning about local-global compositions in sequence models by separating provable guarantees, compositional bounds, and mechanistic diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Joshi, Agniva Chowdhury, Amar Kanakamedala, Ekam Singh, Evan Tu, Anshumali Shrivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Softmax Attention has a quadratic time complexity in sequence length, which becomes prohibitive to run at long contexts, even with highly optimized GPU kernels. For example, FlashAttention-2/3 (exact, GPU-optimized implementations of Softmax Attention) cannot complete a single forward-backward pass of a single attention layer once the context exceeds ~4 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 (96 GB). We introduce Repeated Arrays-of-Count Estimators (RACE) Attention, a kernel-inspired alternative to Softmax Attention that is strictly linear in sequence length and embedding size. RACE Attention replaces the exponential kernel with a sharpened angular similarity, and approximates attention outputs via Gaussian random projections and soft Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), avoiding construction of the full attention matrix. Across language modeling, masked language modeling, and text/image classification, RACE Attention matches or outperforms strong baselines up to 64K seqeuence length while reducing wall-clock time and memory usage. In addition, we conduct a controlled scaling study on a single attention layer and demonstrate processing of up to 12 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU and 75 million tokens on an Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU in a single forward-backward pass, which is well beyond the capabilities of current state-of-the-art attention implementations. RACE Attention thus offers a practical and theoretically grounded mechanism for long-context training on today's hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/sahiljoshi515/RACE_Attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buyun Liang, Liangzu Peng, Jinqi Luo, Darshan Thaker, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Ren\'e Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often exhibit hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks to elicit hallucinations in LLMs, but these methods often rely on unrealistic prompts, either by inserting nonsensical tokens or by altering the original semantic intent. Consequently, such approaches provide limited insight into how hallucinations arise in real-world settings. In contrast, adversarial attacks in computer vision typically involve realistic modifications to input images. However, the problem of identifying realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA), which elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no semantic equivalence or semantic coherence errors compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akira Kitaoka</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven inverse optimization for mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), which seeks to learn an objective function and constraints consistent with observed decisions, is important for building accurate mathematical models in a variety of domains, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing data-driven inverse optimization methods primarily focus on learning objective functions under known constraints, and learning both objective functions and constraints from data remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach for a class of inverse optimization problems in which the objective is a linear combination of given feature functions and the constraints are parameterized by unknown functions and thresholds. Our method first learns the constraints and then, conditioned on the learned constraints, estimates the objective-function weights. On the theoretical side, we provide finite-sample guarantees for solving the proposed inverse optimization problem. To this end, we develop statistical learning tools for pseudo-metric spaces under sub-Gaussian assumptions and use them to derive a learning-theoretic framework for inverse optimization with both unknown objectives and constraints. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method successfully solves inverse optimization problems on scheduling instances formulated as ILPs with up to 100 decision variables.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06714">Dual Goal Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seohong Park, Deepinder Mann, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy, while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based tasks.</p>

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadithya Srikanth, Mudit Gaur, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of discrete-state diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Meyer, Sascha Kaltenpoth, Kevin Zalipski, Oliver M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time-series forecasting, promising zero-shot predictions without the need for task-specific training or fine-tuning. However, similar to Large Language Models (LLMs), the evaluation of TSFMs is challenging: as training corpora grow increasingly large, it becomes difficult to ensure the integrity of the test sets used for benchmarking. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation studies identifies two kinds of information leakage: (1) train-test sample overlaps arising from the multi-purpose reuse of datasets and (2) temporal overlap of correlated train and test series. Ignoring these forms of information leakage when benchmarking TSFMs risks producing overly optimistic performance estimates that fail to generalize to real-world settings. We therefore argue for the development of novel evaluation methodologies that avoid pitfalls already observed in both LLM and classical time-series benchmarking, and we call on the research community to adopt principled approaches to safeguard the integrity of TSFM evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huipeng Huang, Wenbo Liao, Huajun Xi, Hao Zeng, Mengchen Zhao, Hongxin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder. However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lippl, Thomas McGee, Kimberly Lopez, Ziwen Pan, Pierce Zhang, Salma Ziadi, Oliver Eberle, Ida Momennejad</p>
<p>Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activations and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering activations and annotating their matched reasoning traces using an automated LLM pipeline. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4 induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dechen Zhang, Junwei Su, Difan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of quantization targets: data, label, parameter, activation, and gradient. Our novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum and introduces additional approximation error. Crucially, we distinguish the effects of two quantization schemes: we prove that for additive quantization (with constant quantization steps), the noise amplification benefits from a suppression effect scaled by the batch size, while multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent quantization steps) largely preserves the spectral structure, thereby reducing the spectral distortion. Furthermore, under common polynomial-decay data spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jusheng Zhang, Kaitong Cai, Jing Yang, Jian Wang, Chengpei Tang, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranran Haoran Zhang, Soumik Dey, Ashirbad Mishra, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding must produce outputs distribution identical to standard autoregressive generation-this output equivalence is not an optimization target but the defining criterion of valid speculative decoding. We demonstrate that all existing batch speculative decoding implementations violate this fundamental requirement, producing corrupted outputs ranging from repetitive tokens to gibberish. These failures stem from the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, desynchronizing position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We present the first authentic batch speculative decoding framework. We (1) formalize the synchronization invariants that valid batch speculative decoding must satisfy, (2) present EQSPEC, the first algorithm that guarantees output equivalence, and analyze its cost structure to show that alignment overhead grows superlinearly and consumes up to 40\% of computation, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which reduces this overhead through cross-batch scheduling that dynamically groups same-length sequences. On SpecBench across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B pairs, our methods achieve up to 3x throughput improvement at batch size 8 while maintaining algorithmic correctness. Our methods achieve 95\% decoding-equivalence, with residual divergence attributable to floating-point non-determinism in GPU inference, not the synchronization failures that cause near-zero equivalence of prior methods.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in natural language reasoning, yet their application to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) remains limited. CTI analysis involves distilling large volumes of unstructured reports into actionable knowledge, a process where LLMs could substantially reduce analyst workload. CTIBench introduced a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across multiple CTI tasks. In this work, we extend CTIBench by developing AthenaBench, an enhanced benchmark that includes an improved dataset creation pipeline, duplicate removal, refined evaluation metrics, and a new task focused on risk mitigation strategies. We evaluate twelve LLMs, including state-of-the-art proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, alongside seven open-source models from the LLaMA and Qwen families. While proprietary LLMs achieve stronger results overall, their performance remains subpar on reasoning-intensive tasks, such as threat actor attribution and risk mitigation, with open-source models trailing even further behind. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and underscore the need for models explicitly tailored to CTI workflows and automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Gao, Kuang Zhou, Yuchen Zhu, Keyu Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and quantifying node importance is a fundamental problem in network science and engineering, underpinning a wide range of applications such as influence maximization, social recommendation, and network dismantling. Prior research often relies on centrality measures or advanced graph embedding techniques using structural information, followed by downstream classification or regression tasks to identify critical nodes. However, these approaches typically decouple node representation learning from the ranking objective and depend heavily on the topological structure of target networks, leading to feature-task inconsistency and poor cross-network generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to obtain robust and invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Specifically, we introduce an influence-aware causal node embedding module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Furthermore, we design a unified optimization framework incorporating a causal ranking loss that jointly optimizes reconstruction and ranking objectives, thereby enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows the proposed model to be trained on synthetic networks and to generalize effectively across diverse real-world networks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and cross-network transferability, offering new insights for network analysis and engineering applications-particularly in scenarios where the target network's structure is inaccessible in advance due to privacy or security constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung-Long Vuong, Julien Monteil, Hien Dang, Volodymyr Vaskovych, Trung Le, Vu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by \emph{latent proximity}: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes \emph{global} collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: \ding{172} $\beta$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; \ding{173} input masking induces stochastic \emph{geometric} contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Afzal, S. Akshay, Blaise Genest, Ashutosh Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last decade, a large body of work has emerged on robustness of neural networks, i.e., checking if the decision remains unchanged when the input is slightly perturbed. However, most of these approaches ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In this work, we aim to develop a generalized framework for formally reasoning about the confidence along with robustness in neural networks. We propose a simple yet expressive grammar that captures various confidence-based specifications. We develop a novel and unified technique to verify all instances of the grammar in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to the neural network, which enables the use any state-of-the-art neural network verification tool. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks, where the largest network has 138M parameters, and show that this outperforms ad-hoc encoding approaches by a significant margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanakya Ekbote, Vijay Lingam, Sujay Sanghavi, Jun Huan, Behrooz Omidvar-Tehrani, Anoop Deoras, Stefano Soatto</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards(RLVR) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce MURPHY, a multi-turn RLVR framework that incorporates execution feedback directly into training, extending GRPO to optimize over multi-turn trajectories where models iteratively refine solutions. MURPHY combines a feedback conditioned rollout tree with trajectory-level credit assignment, and uses pruning to reduce the cost of multi-turn optimization. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with two model families show that MURPHY consistently improves multi-iteration performance, achieving up to an 8% absolute gain in pass@1 over compute-matched GRPO baselines, and outperforming the prior leading method that incorporates multi-turn execution feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.70 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal was unlikely contributed by demographic features by our machine learning study combining age, race, and sex labels to predict health insurance types; it also remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evolution Strategies (ES) is a class of powerful black-box optimisation methods that are highly parallelisable and can handle non-differentiable and noisy objectives. However, na\"ive ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale on GPUs due to the low arithmetic intensity of batched matrix multiplications with unstructured random perturbations. We introduce Evolution Guided GeneRal Optimisation via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), which improves arithmetic intensity by structuring individual perturbations as rank-$r$ matrices, resulting in a hundredfold increase in training speed for billion-parameter models at large population sizes, achieving up to 91% of the throughput of pure batch inference. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of Gaussian ES for high-dimensional parameter objectives, investigating conditions needed for ES updates to converge in high dimensions. Our results reveal a linearising effect, and proving consistency between EGGROLL and ES as parameter dimension increases. Our experiments show that EGGROLL: (1) enables the stable pretraining of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes, (2) is competitive with GRPO for post-training LLMs on reasoning tasks, and (3) does not compromise performance compared to ES in tabula rasa RL settings, despite being faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuepeng Sheng, Yuwei Huang, Shuman Liu, Anxiang Zeng, Haibo Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central component of post-training for large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks that require stable optimization over long generation horizons. However, achieving performance at scale often introduces a fundamental trade-off between training stability and training efficiency. Token-level optimization applies fine-grained updates at the individual units, but is prone to high variance in gradient estimation, which can result in unstable training dynamics. In contrast, Sequence-level optimization often relies on aggressive clipping mechanisms to ensure stable updates. However, such design may discard a large fraction of valid training samples, leading to inefficient gradient utilization and reduced training efficiency. We refer to this phenomenon as gradient underutilization. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that aims to combine fine-grained updates with stable training. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy Grouping Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy Adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging mathematical benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Wang, Changfeng Gao, Yang Xiang, Zhihao Du, Keyu An, Han Zhao, Qian Chen, Xiangang Li, Yingming Gao, Ya Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daeyong Kwon, SeungHeon Doh, Juhan Nam</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed open-domain question answering, yet their effectiveness in music-related reasoning remains limited due to sparse music knowledge in pretraining data. While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus. We release MusWikiDB and ArtistMus to advance research in music information retrieval and domain-specific question answering, establishing a foundation for retrieval-augmented reasoning in culturally rich domains such as music.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Rui Yin, Yifan Chen, Qi Chen, Chao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\Delta$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $\Delta$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongjun Park, Sunwook Hwang, Hyeonho Noh, Jin Mo Yang, Hyun Jong Yang, Saewoong Bahk</p>
<p>Abstract: Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.
  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustav Chatterjee, Joshua Li, Kundan Parajulee, Jared Schwennesen</p>
<p>Abstract: Steep-profiled Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs) pose safety hazards to vehicles with low ground clearance, which may become stranded on the tracks, creating risks of train vehicle collisions. This research develops a framework for network level evaluation of hang-up susceptibility of HRGCs. Profile data from different crossings in Oklahoma were collected using both a walking profiler and the Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System. A hybrid deep learning model, combining Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures, was developed to reconstruct accurate HRGC profiles from Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System data. Vehicle dimension data from around 350 specialty vehicles were collected at various locations across Oklahoma to enable up-to-date statistical design dimensions. Hang-up susceptibility was analyzed using three vehicle dimension scenarios: (a) median dimension (median wheelbase and ground clearance), (b) 75-25 percentile dimension (75 percentile wheelbase, 25 percentile ground clearance), and (c) worst case dimension (maximum wheelbase and minimum ground clearance). Results indicate 70, 80, and 95 crossings at the highest hang-up risk levels under these scenarios, respectively. An ArcGIS database and a software interface were developed to support transportation agencies in mitigating crossing hazards. This framework advances safety evaluation by integrating next-generation sensing, deep learning, and infrastructure datasets into practical decision support tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question about what it means to be human when we share an increasingly symbiotic relationship with persuasive and creative machines. This paper examines patterns of human-AI coevolution in creative writing, investigating how human craft and agency are adapting alongside machine capabilities. We challenge the prevailing notion of stylistic homogenization by examining diverse patterns in longitudinal writing data. Using a large-scale corpus spanning the pre- and post-LLM era, we observe patterns suggestive of a "Dual-Track Evolution": thematic convergence around AI-related topics, coupled with structured stylistic differentiation. Our analysis reveals three emergent adaptation patterns: authors showing increased similarity to AI style, those exhibiting decreased similarity, and those maintaining stylistic stability while engaging with AI-related themes. This Creative Archetype Map illuminates how authorship is coevolving with AI, contributing to discussions about human-AI collaboration, detection challenges, and the preservation of creative diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Yao, Zhiqiang Wang, Haoran Cheng, Yihang Cheng, Haohua Du, Xiang-Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Agentic AI has established the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standard for connecting reasoning engines with external tools. Although this decoupled architecture fosters modularity, it simultaneously shatters the traditional trust boundary. We uncover a novel privacy vector inherent to this paradigm: the Intent Inversion Attack. We show that semi-honest third-party MCP servers can accurately reconstruct users' underlying intents by leveraging only authorized metadata (e.g., function signatures, arguments, and receipts), effectively bypassing the need for raw query access. To quantify this threat, we introduce IntentMiner. Unlike statistical approaches, IntentMiner employs a hierarchical semantic parsing strategy that performs step-level intent reconstruction by analyzing tool functions, parameter entities, and result feedback in an orthogonal manner. Experiments on the ToolACE benchmark reveal that IntentMiner achieves a semantic alignment of over 85% with original queries, substantially surpassing LLM baselines. This work exposes a critical endogenous vulnerability: without semantic obfuscation, executing functions requires the transparency of intent, thereby challenging the privacy foundations of next-generation AI agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingli Liu, Huannan Zheng, Bohao Zou, Kezhou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Working memory enables the brain to integrate transient information for rapid decision-making. Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthieu Mastio, Paul Saves, Benoit Gaudou, Nicolas Verstaevel</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilesh Jain, Hyungil Suh, Seyi Adeyinka, Leor Roseman, Aza Allsop</p>
<p>Abstract: Qualitative research faces a critical reliability challenge: traditional inter-rater agreement methods require multiple human coders, are time-intensive, and often yield moderate consistency. We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($\kappa$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($\kappa = 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($\kappa = 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($\kappa = 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($\kappa > 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Li, Zhaoning Zhang, Libo Zhang, Huaimin Wang, Xiang Fu, Zhiquan Lai</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates LLM inference by verifying draft tokens in parallel. However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Current SD implementations use a fixed speculative length, failing to adapt to dynamic request rates and creating a significant performance bottleneck in real-world serving scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit. Experiments show that Nightjar achieves up to 14.8% higher throughput and 20.2% lower latency compared to standard speculative decoding, demonstrating robust efficiency for real-time serving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meili Sun, Chunjiang Zhao, Lichao Yang, Hao Liu, Shimin Hu, Ya Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Strawberry harvesting robots faced persistent challenges such as low integration of visual perception, fruit-gripper misalignment, empty grasping/misgrasp, and strawberry slippage from the gripper due to insufficient gripping force, all of which compromised harvesting stability and efficiency in orchard environments. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a visual fault diagnosis and self-recovery framework that integrated multi-task perception with corrective control strategies. At the core of this framework was SRR-Net, an end-to-end multi-task perception model that simultaneously performed strawberry detection, segmentation, and ripeness estimation, thereby unifying visual perception with fault diagnosis.Based on this integrated perception, a relative error compensation method based on the simultaneous target-gripper detection was designed to address positional misalignment, correcting deviations when error exceeded the tolerance threshold.To mitigate empty grasping/misgrasp and fruit-slippage faults, an early abort strategy was implemented. A micro-optical camera embedded in the end-effector provided real-time visual feedback, enabling grasp classification during the deflating stage and strawberry slip prediction during snap-off through MobileNet V3-Small classifier and a time-series LSTM classifier. Experiments demonstrated that SRR-Net maintained high perception accuracy. For detection, it achieved a precision of 0.895 and recall of 0.813 on strawberries, and 0.972/0.958 on hands. In segmentation, it yielded a precision of 0.887 and recall of 0.747 for strawberries, and 0.974/0.947 for hands. For ripeness estimation, SRR-Net attained a mean absolute error of 0.035, while simultaneously supporting multi-task perception and sustaining a competitive inference speed of 163.35 FPS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Almaz Ermilov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents FormationEval, an open multiple-choice question benchmark for evaluating language models on petroleum geoscience and subsurface disciplines. The dataset contains 505 questions across seven domains including petrophysics, petroleum geology and reservoir engineering, derived from three authoritative sources using a reasoning model with detailed instructions and a concept-based approach that avoids verbatim copying of copyrighted text. Each question includes source metadata to support traceability and audit. The evaluation covers 72 models from major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta and open-weight alternatives. The top performers achieve over 97% accuracy, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview reaching 99.8%, while tier and domain gaps persist. Among open-weight models, GLM-4.7 leads at 98.6%, with several DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen and Mistral models also exceeding 93%. The performance gap between open-weight and closed models is narrower than expected, with several lower-cost open-weight models exceeding 90% accuracy. Petrophysics emerges as the most challenging domain across all models, while smaller models show wider performance variance. Residual length bias in the dataset (correct answers tend to be longer) is documented along with bias mitigation strategies applied during construction. The benchmark, evaluation code and results are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Samuel Setiawan, Rapha\"el Merx, Jey Han Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Zixian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model alignment objectives are often presented as a collection of distinct algorithms, such as PPO, DPO, IPO, and their variants, each motivated by different derivations. In this work, we argue that this diversity obscures a simpler underlying structure. At a fundamental level, alignment objectives involve two independent design choices: (i) how training signals are sampled and weighted, and (ii) how deviations from a reference policy are geometrically penalized. Existing methods typically entangle these choices through a single divergence, most commonly the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We show that this entanglement is not merely a modeling convenience but a source of systematic instability. When the same divergence simultaneously determines sample weighting and optimization curvature, adjusting one aspect, such as exploration strength, inevitably alters the other, such as gradient geometry. This coupling is particularly problematic in preference-based reinforcement learning, where advantage signals are unbounded and high-confidence regimes are common. We propose a principled structural remedy by formulating alignment as an orthogonal mirror descent problem, in which sampling geometry enters as a linear driving force derived from an alpha-divergence projection, while optimization geometry is determined independently by a Bregman divergence, or mirror map. This perspective leads to a new alignment objective called Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), obtained by choosing a Euclidean mirror map in likelihood ratio space. The resulting objective admits a closed-form solution, linear and non-saturating gradient dynamics, and a well-conditioned trust region, while remaining fully compatible with standard large language model training pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asif Mohammed Samir, Mohammad Masudur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'ictor Yeste, Paolo Rosso</p>
<p>Abstract: We study sentence-level detection of the 19 human values in the refined Schwartz continuum in about 74k English sentences from news and political manifestos (ValueEval'24 corpus). Each sentence is annotated with value presence, yielding a binary moral-presence label and a 19-way multi-label task under severe class imbalance. First, we show that moral presence is learnable from single sentences: a DeBERTa-base classifier attains positive-class F1 = 0.74 with calibrated thresholds. Second, we compare direct multi-label value detectors with presence-gated hierarchies in a setting where only a single consumer-grade GPU with 8 GB of VRAM is available, and we explicitly choose all training and inference configurations to fit within this budget. Presence gating does not improve over direct prediction, indicating that gate recall becomes a bottleneck. Third, we investigate lightweight auxiliary signals - short-range context, LIWC-22, and moral lexica - and small ensembles. Our best supervised configuration, a soft-voting ensemble of DeBERTa-based models enriched with such signals, reaches macro-F1 = 0.332 on the 19 values, improving over the best previous English-only baseline on this corpus, namely the best official ValueEval'24 English run (macro-F1 = 0.28 on the same 19-value test set). Methodologically, our study provides, to our knowledge, the first systematic comparison of direct versus presence-gated architectures, lightweight feature-augmented encoders, and medium-sized instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for refined Schwartz values at sentence level. We additionally benchmark 7-9B instruction-tuned LLMs (Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B) in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups, and find that they lag behind the supervised ensemble under the same compute budget. Overall, our results provide empirical guidance for building compute-efficient, value-aware NLP models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Tseng, Juan Carlos Toledano, Bart De Clerck, Yuliia Dukach, Phil Tinn</p>
<p>Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler of the collective defense capability -- both conventional and hybrid -- of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to threat characterization, sustained situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further reduced the cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic, agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop an agent coordination pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluate the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. Our results show that the approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis -- including uncovering more than 30 previously undetected Russian bot accounts during manual analysis -- and provides a direct contribution to enhancing situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media- and information-rich settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabi Nahian Madhurja, Rusab Sarmun, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury, Adam Mushtak, Israa Al-Hashimi, Sohaib Bassam Zoghoul</p>
<p>Abstract: Cervical spine fractures are critical medical conditions requiring precise and efficient detection for effective clinical management. This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Zhu, Rongzhe Wei, Yupu Gu, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansheng Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing scaling paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) rests on a substrate of "Fuzzy" floating-point arithmetic. To mitigate the inherent instability of this approximate foundation, modern architectures have erected a complex scaffolding of structural and numerical heuristics--Complex Residuals, Pre-RMSNorm, Attention Scaling, and Gradient Clipping--consuming significant compute solely to prevent numerical collapse.
  We propose a paradigm shift to the "Exact". We introduce the Halo Architecture, grounded in the Rational Field (Q) and powered by a custom Exact Inference Unit (EIU). To resolve the exponential bit-width growth of rational arithmetic, Halo employs a Dual-Ring Topology that unifies two complementary control mechanisms: (1) The Micro-Ring (Continuum Maintenance), which strictly bounds memory complexity via Diophantine Approximation; and (2) The Macro-Ring (Symbolic Alignment), which enforces logical consistency via periodic state collapse.
  This stable dual-ring substrate allows for the "Great Dismantling" of numerical scaffolding, reducing the Transformer block to its "Clean" algebraic form (Tabula Rasa). Furthermore, we verify the "Efficiency Paradox": the elimination of gradient noise (sigma -> 0) allows for Macro-Learning Rates, potentially reducing the Total Time-to-Convergence by orders of magnitude. Halo demonstrates that General Intelligence requires the hybridization of continuous fields and discrete chains under a rigorous mathematical framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Tang, Jilin Mei, Dongrui Liu, Chen Qian, Dawei Cheng, Jing Shao, Xia Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model-powered multi-agent systems have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex human-like systems. The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain why an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Caldas, Sahil Kumar, Cl\'audia Soares</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in information retrieval, yet existing research has mainly focused on text or static multimodal settings. Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Schiekiera, Max Zimmer, Christophe Roux, Sebastian Pokutta, Fritz G\"unther</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the extent to which an LLM's hidden-state geometry can be recovered from its behavior in psycholinguistic experiments. Across eight instruction-tuned transformer models, we run two experimental paradigms -- similarity-based forced choice and free association -- over a shared 5,000-word vocabulary, collecting 17.5M+ trials to build behavior-based similarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry. Finally, we discuss implications for the ability of behavioral tasks to uncover hidden cognitive states.</p>

<p>Abstract: Query Auto-Completion (QAC) suggests query completions as users type, helping them articulate intent and reach results more efficiently. Existing approaches face fundamental challenges: traditional retrieve-and-rank pipelines have limited long-tail coverage and require extensive feature engineering, while recent generative methods suffer from hallucination and safety risks. We present a unified framework that reformulates QAC as end-to-end list generation through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-objective Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) reformulating QAC as end-to-end list generation with multi-objective optimization; (2) defining and deploying a suite of rule-based, model-based, and LLM-as-judge verifiers for QAC, and using them in a comprehensive methodology that combines RAG, multi-objective DPO, and iterative critique-revision for high-quality synthetic data; (3) a hybrid serving architecture enabling efficient production deployment under strict latency constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale commercial search platform demonstrates substantial improvements: offline metrics show gains across all dimensions, human evaluation yields +0.40 to +0.69 preference scores, and a controlled online experiment achieves 5.44\% reduction in keystrokes and 3.46\% increase in suggestion adoption, validating that unified generation with RAG and multi-objective alignment provides an effective solution for production QAC. This work represents a paradigm shift to end-to-end generation powered by large language models, RAG, and multi-objective alignment, establishing a production-validated framework that can benefit the broader search and recommendation industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Cui, Wenqiang Li, Shuai Zhou, Ruifeng Qin, Feng Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijit Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery when labeled data are scarce. This work presents \modelname, a graph transformer augmented with a query-conditioned cardinality-preserving attention (CPA) channel that retains dynamic support-size signals complementary to static centrality embeddings. The approach combines structured sparse attention with Graphormer-inspired biases (shortest-path distance, centrality, direct-bond features) and unified dual-objective self-supervised pretraining (masked reconstruction and contrastive alignment of augmented views). Evaluation on 11 public benchmarks spanning MoleculeNet, OGB, and TDC ADMET demonstrates consistent improvements over protocol-matched baselines under matched pretraining, optimization, and hyperparameter tuning. Rigorous ablations confirm CPA's contributions and rule out simple size shortcuts. Code and reproducibility artifacts are provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asif Tauhid, Sidahmed Benabderrahmane, Mohamad Altrabulsi, Ahamed Foisal, Talal Rahwan</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing-Cheng Pang, Liang Lu, Xian Tang, Kun Jiang, Sijie Wu, Kai Zhang, Xubin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of promising tokens and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for accelerating scientific research. While models are increasingly capable of assisting with routine tasks, their ability to contribute to novel, expert-level mathematical discovery is less understood. We present a collection of case studies demonstrating how researchers have successfully collaborated with advanced AI models, specifically Google's Gemini-based models (in particular Gemini Deep Think and its advanced variants), to solve open problems, refute conjectures, and generate new proofs across diverse areas in theoretical computer science, as well as other areas such as economics, optimization, and physics. Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer. While the majority of our results stem from this interactive, conversational methodology, we also highlight specific instances that push beyond standard chat interfaces. These include deploying the model as a rigorous adversarial reviewer to detect subtle flaws in existing proofs, and embedding it within a "neuro-symbolic" loop that autonomously writes and executes code to verify complex derivations. Together, these examples highlight the potential of AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a versatile, genuine partner in the creative process of scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emiliano Penaloza, Dheeraj Vattikonda, Nicolas Gontier, Alexandre Lacoste, Laurent Charlin, Massimo Caccia</p>
<p>Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, which typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable, but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce {\pi}-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically, we find that {\pi}-Distill and, in some cases, OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on {\pi}-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Merlin de la Haye, Pascal Lenzner, Farehe Soheil, Marcus Wunderlich</p>
<p>Abstract: Hedonic games are fundamental models for investigating the formation of coalitions among a set of strategic agents, where every agent has a certain utility for every possible coalition of agents it can be part of. To avoid the intractability of defining exponentially many utilities for all possible coalitions, many variants with succinct representations of the agents' utility functions have been devised and analyzed, e.g., modified fractional hedonic games by Monaco et al. [JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.
  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifu Qiu, Zheng Zhao, Waylon Li, Yftah Ziser, Anna Korhonen, Shay B. Cohen, Edoardo M. Ponti</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_\theta(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_\phi(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sohan Venkatesh, Ashish Mahendran Kurapath</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation steering methods are widely used to control large language model (LLM) behavior and are often interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We show that, under white-box single-layer access, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we show that orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes across multiple models and traits. Critically, we show that the non-identifiability is a robust geometric property that persists across diverse prompt distributions. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and highlight the need for structural constraints beyond behavioral testing to enable reliable alignment interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shang Liu, Hanyu Pei, Zeyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have been successful in numerous fields. Alignment has usually been applied to prevent them from harmful purposes. However, aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that deliberately mislead them into producing harmful outputs. Existing jailbreaks are either black-box, using carefully crafted, unstealthy prompts, or white-box, requiring resource-intensive computation. In light of these challenges, we introduce ShallowJail, a novel attack that exploits shallow alignment in LLMs. ShallowJail can misguide LLMs' responses by manipulating the initial tokens during inference. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ShallowJail, which substantially degrades the safety of state-of-the-art LLM responses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Jiang, Junrong Chen, Eftychia Makri, Jialin Chen, Peiwen Li, Ali Maatouk, Leandros Tassiulas, Eliot Brenner, Bing Xiang, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the finance domain, LLMs are increasingly expected to parse complex regulatory disclosures. However, existing benchmarks often focus on isolated details, failing to reflect the complexity of professional analysis that requires synthesizing information across multiple documents, reporting periods, and corporate entities. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not disentangle whether errors arise from retrieval failures, generation inaccuracies, domain-specific reasoning mistakes, or misinterpretation of the query or context, making it difficult to precisely diagnose performance bottlenecks. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Fin-RATE, a benchmark built on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and mirroring financial analyst workflows through three pathways: detail-oriented reasoning within individual disclosures, cross-entity comparison under shared topics, and longitudinal tracking of the same firm across reporting periods. We benchmark 17 leading LLMs, spanning open-source, closed-source, and finance-specialized models, under both ground-truth context and retrieval-augmented settings. Results show substantial performance degradation, with accuracy dropping by 18.60\% and 14.35\% as tasks shift from single-document reasoning to longitudinal and cross-entity analysis. This degradation is driven by increased comparison hallucinations, temporal and entity mismatches, and is further reflected in declines in reasoning quality and factual consistency--limitations that existing benchmarks have yet to formally categorize or quantify.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid facial expression shadowing enables robots to realistically imitate human facial expressions in real time, which is critical for lifelike, facially expressive humanoid robots and affective human-robot interaction. Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations. Extensive real-world demonstrations validate its practical utility. Videos are available at: https://lipzh5.github.io/VividFace/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Babak Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Philip Wahle</p>
<p>Abstract: Language enables humans to share knowledge, reason about the world, and pass on strategies for survival and innovation across generations. At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv. In identifying duplicate questions on Quora, models trained with paraphrase types improve over models trained on binary pairs. Furthermore, I demonstrate that...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vid Kocijan, Jinu Sunil, Jan Eric Lenssen, Viman Deb, Xinwei Xe, Federico Reyes Gomez, Matthias Fey, Jure Leskovec</p>
<p>Abstract: The purpose of predictive modeling on relational data is to predict future or missing values in a relational database, for example, future purchases of a user, risk of readmission of the patient, or the likelihood that a financial transaction is fraudulent. Typically powered by machine learning methods, predictive models are used in recommendations, financial fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and other systems, providing billions of predictions every day. However, training a machine learning model requires manual work to extract the required training examples - prediction entities and target labels - from the database, which is slow, laborious, and prone to mistakes. Here, we present the Predictive Query Language (PQL), an SQL-inspired declarative language for defining predictive tasks on relational databases. PQL allows specifying a predictive task in a single declarative query, enabling the automatic computation of training labels for a large variety of machine learning tasks, such as regression, classification, time-series forecasting, and recommender systems. PQL is already successfully integrated and used in a collection of use cases as part of a predictive AI platform. The versatility of the language can be demonstrated through its many ongoing use cases, including financial fraud, item recommendations, and workload prediction. We demonstrate its versatile design through two implementations; one for small-scale, low-latency use and one that can handle large-scale databases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deriving predictable scaling laws that govern the relationship between model performance and computational investment is crucial for designing and allocating resources in massive-scale recommendation systems. While such laws are established for large language models, they remain challenging for recommendation systems, especially those processing both user history and context features. We identify poor scaling efficiency as the main barrier to predictable power-law scaling, stemming from inefficient modules with low Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce Kunlun, a scalable architecture that systematically improves model efficiency and resource allocation. Our low-level optimizations include Generalized Dot-Product Attention (GDPA), Hierarchical Seed Pooling (HSP), and Sliding Window Attention. Our high-level innovations feature Computation Skip (CompSkip) and Event-level Personalization. These advances increase MFU from 17% to 37% on NVIDIA B200 GPUs and double scaling efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. Kunlun is now deployed in major Meta Ads models, delivering significant production impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lepeng Zhao, Zhenhua Zou, Shuo Li, Zhuotao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automating complex smartphone tasks by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and system-level control interfaces. However, this paradigm introduces significant privacy risks, as agents typically capture and process entire screen contents, thereby exposing sensitive personal data such as phone numbers, addresses, messages, and financial information. Existing defenses either reduce UI exposure, obfuscate only task-irrelevant content, or rely on user authorization, but none can protect task-critical sensitive information while preserving seamless agent usability.
  We propose an anonymization-based privacy protection framework that enforces the principle of available-but-invisible access to sensitive data: sensitive information remains usable for task execution but is never directly visible to the cloud-based agent. Our system detects sensitive UI content using a PII-aware recognition model and replaces it with deterministic, type-preserving placeholders (e.g., PHONE_NUMBER#a1b2c) that retain semantic categories while removing identifying details. A layered architecture comprising a PII Detector, UI Transformer, Secure Interaction Proxy, and Privacy Gatekeeper ensures consistent anonymization across user instructions, XML hierarchies, and screenshots, mediates all agent actions over anonymized interfaces, and supports narrowly scoped local computations when reasoning over raw values is necessary.
  Extensive experiments on the AndroidLab and PrivScreen benchmarks show that our framework substantially reduces privacy leakage across multiple models while incurring only modest utility degradation, achieving the best observed privacy-utility trade-off among existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanting Ye, Qiyan Zhao, Wenhao Yu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Jianmin Ji, Yanyong Zhang, Ka-Veng Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihan Zha, Asher J. Hancock, Mingtong Zhang, Tenny Yin, Yixuan Huang, Dhruv Shah, Allen Z. Ren, Anirudha Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Xiao, Santiago Aranguri</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose activation-based data attribution, a method that traces behavioral changes in post-trained language models to responsible training datapoints. By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arthur Juliani</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper formalizes religious epistemology through the mathematics of Variational Autoencoders. We model religious traditions as distinct generative mappings from a shared, low-dimensional latent space to the high-dimensional space of observable cultural forms, and define three competing generative configurations corresponding to exclusivism, universalism, and perennialism, alongside syncretism as direct mixing in observable space. Through abductive comparison, we argue that exclusivism cannot parsimoniously account for cross-traditional contemplative convergence, that syncretism fails because combining the outputs of distinct generative processes produces incoherent artifacts, and that universalism suffers from posterior collapse: stripping traditions to a common core discards the structural information necessary for inference. The perennialist configuration provides the best explanatory fit. Within this framework, strict orthodoxy emerges not as a cultural constraint but as a structural necessity: the contemplative practices that recover the latent source must be matched to the specific tradition whose forms they take as input. The unity of religions, if it exists, is real but inaccessible by shortcut: one must go deep rather than wide.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungyeon Yoo, Youngseok Jang, Dabin Kim, Youngsoo Han, Seungwoo Jung, H. Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate these challenges, prior GS-based works have considered only static scenes or non-photorealistic human obstacles built from simulator assets, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios in target environments by augmenting a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains navigation policies using the generated datasets. The pipeline provides three key contributions: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates static scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) a navigation dataset generation framework that leverages the simulator along with a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations and a human planner, and (3) robust navigation policies to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The proposed simulator generates thousands of photorealistic navigation scenarios with animatable human GS avatars from arbitrary viewpoints. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lai Wei, Liangbo He, Jun Lan, Lingzhong Dong, Yutong Cai, Siyuan Li, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Linghe Kong, Yue Wang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Weiran Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12247">ExtractBench: A Benchmark and Evaluation Methodology for Complex Structured Extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nick Ferguson, Josh Pennington, Narek Beghian, Aravind Mohan, Douwe Kiela, Sheshansh Agrawal, Thien Hang Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Unstructured documents like PDFs contain valuable structured information, but downstream systems require this data in reliable, standardized formats. LLMs are increasingly deployed to automate this extraction, making accuracy and reliability paramount. However, progress is bottlenecked by two gaps. First, no end-to-end benchmark evaluates PDF-to-JSON extraction under enterprise-scale schema breadth. Second, no principled methodology captures the semantics of nested extraction, where fields demand different notions of correctness (exact match for identifiers, tolerance for quantities, semantic equivalence for names), arrays require alignment, and omission must be distinguished from hallucination. We address both gaps with ExtractBench, an open-source benchmark and evaluation framework for PDF-to-JSON structured extraction. The benchmark pairs 35 PDF documents with JSON Schemas and human-annotated gold labels across economically valuable domains, yielding 12,867 evaluatable fields spanning schema complexities from tens to hundreds of fields. The evaluation framework treats the schema as an executable specification: each field declares its scoring metric. Baseline evaluations reveal that frontier models (GPT-5/5.2, Gemini-3 Flash/Pro, Claude 4.5 Opus/Sonnet) remain unreliable on realistic schemas. Performance degrades sharply with schema breadth, culminating in 0% valid output on a 369-field financial reporting schema across all tested models. We release ExtractBench at https://github.com/ContextualAI/extract-bench.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12384">Why Deep Jacobian Spectra Separate: Depth-Induced Scaling and Singular-Vector Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathana\"el Haas, Fran\c{c}ois Gatine, Augustin M Cosse, Zied Bouraoui</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding why gradient-based training in deep networks exhibits strong implicit bias remains challenging, in part because tractable singular-value dynamics are typically available only for balanced deep linear models. We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renjun Xu, Yang Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: The transition from monolithic language models to modular, skill-equipped agents marks a defining shift in how large language models (LLMs) are deployed in practice. Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the {SKILL.md} specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries, autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems. Unlike prior surveys that broadly cover LLM agents or tool use, this work focuses specifically on the emerging skill abstraction layer and its implications for the next generation of agentic systems.

<p>Abstract: We present MedXIAOHE, a medical vision-language foundation model designed to advance general-purpose medical understanding and reasoning in real-world clinical applications. MedXIAOHE achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical benchmarks and surpasses leading closed-source multimodal systems on multiple capabilities. To achieve this, we propose an entity-aware continual pretraining framework that organizes heterogeneous medical corpora to broaden knowledge coverage and reduce long-tail gaps (e.g., rare diseases). For medical expert-level reasoning and interaction, MedXIAOHE incorporates diverse medical reasoning patterns via reinforcement learning and tool-augmented agentic training, enabling multi-step diagnostic reasoning with verifiable decision traces. To improve reliability in real-world use, MedXIAOHE integrates user-preference rubrics, evidence-grounded reasoning, and low-hallucination long-form report generation, with improved adherence to medical instructions. We release this report to document our practical design choices, scaling insights, and evaluation framework, hoping to inspire further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xiao, Xinhai Chen, Jiaming Peng, Qinglin Wang, Menghan Jia, Zhiquan Lai, Guangping Yu, Dongsheng Li, Tiejun Li, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable equations from observational data, with the potential to reveal underlying principles behind natural phenomena. However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.</p>
