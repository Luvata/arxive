<p>Abstract: Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data. Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text, speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608 languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text, speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal audit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and video.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Odd Erik Gundersen, Odd Cappelen, Martin M{\o}ln{\aa}, Nicklas Grimstad Nilsen</p>
<p>Abstract: A reproducibility crisis has been reported in science, but the extent to which it affects AI research is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we performed a systematic replication study including 30 highly cited AI studies relying on original materials when available. In the end, eight articles were rejected because they required access to data or hardware that was practically impossible to acquire as part of the project. Six articles were successfully reproduced, while five were partially reproduced. In total, 50% of the articles included was reproduced to some extent. The availability of code and data correlate strongly with reproducibility, as 86% of articles that shared code and data were fully or partly reproduced, while this was true for 33% of articles that shared only data. The quality of the data documentation correlates with successful replication. Poorly documented or miss-specified data will probably result in unsuccessful replication. Surprisingly, the quality of the code documentation does not correlate with successful replication. Whether the code is poorly documented, partially missing, or not versioned is not important for successful replication, as long as the code is shared. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of open science and the importance of properly documenting data work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohong Lin, Xin Huang, Tung Phan-Minh, David S. Hayden, Huan Zhang, Ding Zhao, Siddhartha Srinivasa, Eric M. Wolff, Hongge Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Simulation is critical for safety evaluation in autonomous driving, particularly in capturing complex interactive behaviors. However, generating realistic and controllable traffic scenarios in long-tail situations remains a significant challenge. Existing generative models suffer from the conflicting objective between user-defined controllability and realism constraints, which is amplified in safety-critical contexts. In this work, we introduce the Causal Compositional Diffusion Model (CCDiff), a structure-guided diffusion framework to address these challenges. We first formulate the learning of controllable and realistic closed-loop simulation as a constrained optimization problem. Then, CCDiff maximizes controllability while adhering to realism by automatically identifying and injecting causal structures directly into the diffusion process, providing structured guidance to enhance both realism and controllability. Through rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets and in a closed-loop simulator, CCDiff demonstrates substantial gains over state-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic and user-preferred trajectories. Our results show CCDiff's effectiveness in extracting and leveraging causal structures, showing improved closed-loop performance based on key metrics such as collision rate, off-road rate, FDE, and comfort.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antony Seabra, Claudio Cavalcante, Joao Nepomuceno, Lucas Lago, Nicolaas Ruberg, Sergio Lifschitz</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a question-and-answer (Q\&A) application designed to support the contract management process by leveraging combined information from contract documents (PDFs) and data retrieved from contract management systems (database). This data is processed by a large language model (LLM) to provide precise and relevant answers. The accuracy of these responses is further enhanced through the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), text-to-SQL techniques, and agents that dynamically orchestrate the workflow. These techniques eliminate the need to retrain the language model. Additionally, we employed Prompt Engineering to fine-tune the focus of responses. Our findings demonstrate that this multi-agent orchestration and combination of techniques significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of the answers, offering a promising direction for future information systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Tan, Neftali Watkinson Medina</p>
<p>Abstract: NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Networks) has revolutionized chess engine development, with nearly all top engines adopting NNUE models to maintain competitive performance. A key challenge in NNUE training is the creation of high-quality datasets, particularly in complex domains like chess, where tactical and strategic evaluations are essential. However, methods for constructing effective datasets remain poorly understood and under-documented. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for generating and filtering datasets composed of "quiet" positions that are stable and free from tactical volatility. Our approach provides a clear methodology for dataset creation, which can be replicated and generalized across various evaluation functions. Testing demonstrates significant improvements in engine performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antony Seabra, Claudio Cavalcante, Joao Nepomuceno, Lucas Lago, Nicolaas Ruberg, Sergio Lifschitz</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a methodology that combines several advanced techniques in Large Language Model (LLM) retrieval to support the development of robust, multi-source question-answer systems. This methodology is designed to integrate information from diverse data sources, including unstructured documents (PDFs) and structured databases, through a coordinated multi-agent orchestration and dynamic retrieval approach. Our methodology leverages specialized agents-such as SQL agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents, and router agents - that dynamically select the most appropriate retrieval strategy based on the nature of each query. To further improve accuracy and contextual relevance, we employ dynamic prompt engineering, which adapts in real time to query-specific contexts. The methodology's effectiveness is demonstrated within the domain of Contract Management, where complex queries often require seamless interaction between unstructured and structured data. Our results indicate that this approach enhances response accuracy and relevance, offering a versatile and scalable framework for developing question-answer systems that can operate across various domains and data sources.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18073">Understanding Artificial Neural Network&#x27;s Behavior from Neuron Activation Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Zhang, Yang Sui</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the intricate behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs) through the lens of neuron activation dynamics. We propose a probabilistic framework that can analyze models' neuron activation patterns as a stochastic process, uncovering theoretical insights into neural scaling laws, such as over-parameterization and the power-law decay of loss with respect to dataset size. By deriving key mathematical relationships, we present that the number of activated neurons increases in the form of $N(1-(\frac{bN}{D+bN})^b)$, and the neuron activation should follows power-law distribution. Based on these two mathematical results, we demonstrate how DNNs maintain generalization capabilities even under over-parameterization, and we elucidate the phase transition phenomenon observed in loss curves as dataset size plotted in log-axis (i.e. the data magnitude increases linearly). Moreover, by combining the above two phenomenons and the power-law distribution of neuron activation, we derived the power-law decay of neural network's loss function as the data size scale increases. Furthermore, our analysis bridges the gap between empirical observations and theoretical underpinnings, offering experimentally testable predictions regarding parameter efficiency and model compressibility. These findings provide a foundation for understanding neural network scaling and present new directions for optimizing DNN performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18084">Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Lin, Long Chen, Yile Wang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various natural language processing tasks such as question answering and machine translation. However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18091">AutoSculpt: A Pattern-based Model Auto-pruning Framework Using Reinforcement Learning and Graph Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lixian Jing, Jianpeng Qi, Junyu Dong, Yanwei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed on edge devices, optimizing models for constrained computational resources is critical. Existing auto-pruning methods face challenges due to the diversity of DNN models, various operators (e.g., filters), and the difficulty in balancing pruning granularity with model accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoSculpt, a pattern-based automated pruning framework designed to enhance efficiency and accuracy by leveraging graph learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). AutoSculpt automatically identifies and prunes regular patterns within DNN architectures that can be recognized by existing inference engines, enabling runtime acceleration. Three key steps in AutoSculpt include: (1) Constructing DNNs as graphs to encode their topology and parameter dependencies, (2) embedding computationally efficient pruning patterns, and (3) utilizing DRL to iteratively refine auto-pruning strategies until the optimal balance between compression and accuracy is achieved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSculpt across various architectures, including ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, and Vision Transformer, achieving pruning rates of up to 90% and nearly 18% improvement in FLOPs reduction, outperforming all baselines.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools in healthcare, particularly for complex, domain-specific tasks. This study describes the development and evaluation of the PErioperative AI CHatbot (PEACH), a secure LLM-based system integrated with local perioperative guidelines to support preoperative clinical decision-making. PEACH was embedded with 35 institutional perioperative protocols in the secure Claude 3.5 Sonet LLM framework within Pair Chat (developed by Singapore Government) and tested in a silent deployment with real-world data. Accuracy, safety, and usability were assessed. Deviations and hallucinations were categorized based on potential harm, and user feedback was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Updates were made after the initial silent deployment to amend one protocol.
  In 240 real-world clinical iterations, PEACH achieved a first-generation accuracy of 97.5% (78/80) and an overall accuracy of 96.7% (232/240) across three iterations. The updated PEACH demonstrated improved accuracy of 97.9% (235/240), with a statistically significant difference from the null hypothesis of 95% accuracy (p = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.952-0.991). Minimal hallucinations and deviations were observed (both 1/240 and 2/240, respectively). Clinicians reported that PEACH expedited decisions in 95% of cases, and inter-rater reliability ranged from kappa 0.772-0.893 within PEACH and 0.610-0.784 among attendings.
  PEACH is an accurate, adaptable tool that enhances consistency and efficiency in perioperative decision-making. Future research should explore its scalability across specialties and its impact on clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingcong Song, Xinru Tang, Fengfan Hou, Jing Li, Wei Wei, Yipeng Ma, Runqiu Xiao, Hongjie Si, Dingcheng Jiang, Shouyi Yin, Yang Hu, Guoping Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Meeting growing demands for low latency and cost efficiency in production-grade large language model (LLM) serving systems requires integrating advanced optimization techniques. However, dynamic and unpredictable input-output lengths of LLM, compounded by these optimizations, exacerbate the issues of workload variability, making it difficult to maintain high efficiency on AI accelerators, especially DSAs with tile-based programming models. To address this challenge, we introduce XY-Serve, a versatile, Ascend native, end-to-end production LLM-serving system. The core idea is an abstraction mechanism that smooths out the workload variability by decomposing computations into unified, hardware-friendly, fine-grained meta primitives. For attention, we propose a meta-kernel that computes the basic pattern of matmul-softmax-matmul with architectural-aware tile sizes. For GEMM, we introduce a virtual padding scheme that adapts to dynamic shape changes while using highly efficient GEMM primitives with assorted fixed tile sizes. XY-Serve sits harmoniously with vLLM. Experimental results show up to 89% end-to-end throughput improvement compared with current publicly available baselines on Ascend NPUs. Additionally, our approach outperforms existing GEMM (average 14.6% faster) and attention (average 21.5% faster) kernels relative to existing libraries. While the work is Ascend native, we believe the approach can be readily applicable to SIMT architectures as well.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their remarkable capabilities across various domains, whose vast parameter scales present challenges for practical deployment. Structured pruning is an effective method to balance model performance with efficiency, but performance restoration under computational resource constraints is a principal challenge in pruning LLMs. Therefore, we present a low-cost and fast structured pruning method for LLMs named SlimGPT based on the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework. We propose Batched Greedy Pruning for rapid and near-optimal pruning, which enhances the accuracy of head-wise pruning error estimation through grouped Cholesky decomposition and improves the pruning efficiency of FFN via Dynamic Group Size, thereby achieving approximate local optimal pruning results within one hour. Besides, we explore the limitations of layer-wise pruning from the perspective of error accumulation and propose Incremental Pruning Ratio, a non-uniform pruning strategy to reduce performance degradation. Experimental results on the LLaMA benchmark show that SlimGPT outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingming Zhang, Zhiqing Xiao, Guoshan Lu, Sai Wu, Weiqiang Wang, Xing Fu, Can Yi, Junbo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data, which accounts for over 80% of enterprise data assets, is vital in various fields. With growing concerns about privacy protection and data-sharing restrictions, generating high-quality synthetic tabular data has become essential. Recent advancements show that large language models (LLMs) can effectively gener-ate realistic tabular data by leveraging semantic information and overcoming the challenges of high-dimensional data that arise from one-hot encoding. However, current methods do not fully utilize the rich information available in tables. To address this, we introduce AI Generative Table (AIGT) based on prompt enhancement, a novel approach that utilizes meta data information, such as table descriptions and schemas, as prompts to generate ultra-high quality synthetic data. To overcome the token limit constraints of LLMs, we propose long-token partitioning algorithms that enable AIGT to model tables of any scale. AIGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 out of 20 public datasets and two real industry datasets within the Alipay risk control system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption. Code will be open-sourced.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18125">Exact Acceleration of Subgraph Graph Neural Networks by Eliminating Computation Redundancy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Tao, Xiyuan Wang, Muhan Zhang, Shuxian Hu, Wenyuan Yu, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a prevalent framework for graph tasks. Many recent studies have proposed the use of graph convolution methods over the numerous subgraphs of each graph, a concept known as subgraph graph neural networks (subgraph GNNs), to enhance GNNs' ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. To maximize the expressiveness, subgraph GNNs often require each subgraph to have equal size to the original graph. Despite their impressive performance, subgraph GNNs face challenges due to the vast number and large size of subgraphs which lead to a surge in training data, resulting in both storage and computational inefficiencies. In response to this problem, this paper introduces Ego-Nets-Fit-All (ENFA), a model that uniformly takes the smaller ego nets as subgraphs, thereby providing greater storage and computational efficiency, while at the same time guarantees identical outputs to the original subgraph GNNs even taking the whole graph as subgraphs. The key is to identify and eliminate the redundant computation among subgraphs. For example, a node $v_i$ may appear in multiple subgraphs but is far away from all of their centers (the unsymmetric part between subgraphs). Therefore, its first few rounds of message passing within each subgraph can be computed once in the original graph instead of being computed multiple times within each subgraph. Such strategy enables our ENFA to accelerate subgraph GNNs in an exact way, unlike previous sampling approaches that often lose the performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets reveal that compared with the conventional subgraph GNNs, ENFA can reduce storage space by 29.0% to 84.5% and improve training efficiency by up to 1.66x.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148">Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Sun, Zongmin Zhang, Xinyue Shen, Ziyi Zhang, Yule Liu, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, a systematic study to assess the prevalence of AIGTs on social media is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify, monitor, and analyze the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs over time and observe different trends of AI Attribution Rate (AAR) across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shray Mathur, Noah van der Vleuten, Kevin Yager, Esther Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific user facilities, such as synchrotron beamlines, are equipped with a wide array of hardware and software tools that require a codebase for human-computer-interaction. This often necessitates developers to be involved to establish connection between users/researchers and the complex instrumentation. The advent of generative AI presents an opportunity to bridge this knowledge gap, enabling seamless communication and efficient experimental workflows. Here we present a modular architecture for the Virtual Scientific Companion (VISION) by assembling multiple AI-enabled cognitive blocks that each scaffolds large language models (LLMs) for a specialized task. With VISION, we performed LLM-based operation on the beamline workstation with low latency and demonstrated the first voice-controlled experiment at an X-ray scattering beamline. The modular and scalable architecture allows for easy adaptation to new instrument and capabilities. Development on natural language-based scientific experimentation is a building block for an impending future where a science exocortex -- a synthetic extension to the cognition of scientists -- may radically transform scientific practice and discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thierry Poibeau (Lattice)</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relevance of large language models (LLMs) for annotating references to Roman and Greek mythological entities in modern and contemporary French literature. We present an annotation scheme and demonstrate that recent LLMs can be directly applied to follow this scheme effectively, although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors. Additionally, we show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) are capable of offering interpretative insights into the use of mythological references by literary authors. However, we also find that LLMs struggle to accurately identify relevant passages in novels (when used as an information retrieval engine), often hallucinating and generating fabricated examples-an issue that raises significant ethical concerns. Nonetheless, when used carefully, LLMs remain valuable tools for performing annotations with high accuracy, especially for tasks that would be difficult to annotate comprehensively on a large scale through manual methods alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacai Liu, Chaojie Wang, Chris Yuhao Liu, Liang Zeng, Rui Yan, Yiwen Sun, Yang Liu, Yahui Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant. Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs. One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples. Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes. To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm. Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy. Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO. We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks. Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Di Maio, Cristian Cosci, Marco Maggini, Valentina Poggioni, Stefano Melacci</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing ubiquity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in several real-world services triggers severe concerns about their security. A RAG system improves the generative capabilities of a Large Language Models (LLM) by a retrieval mechanism which operates on a private knowledge base, whose unintended exposure could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of private and sensitive information. This paper presents a black-box attack to force a RAG system to leak its private knowledge base which, differently from existing approaches, is adaptive and automatic. A relevance-based mechanism and an attacker-side open-source LLM favor the generation of effective queries to leak most of the (hidden) knowledge base. Extensive experimentation proves the quality of the proposed algorithm in different RAG pipelines and domains, comparing to very recent related approaches, which turn out to be either not fully black-box, not adaptive, or not based on open-source models. The findings from our study remark the urgent need for more robust privacy safeguards in the design and deployment of RAG systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viviane Clay, Niels Leadholm, Jeff Hawkins</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly in the last decade, driven primarily by progress in the scale of deep-learning systems. Despite these advances, the creation of intelligent systems that can operate effectively in diverse, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. In this white paper, we outline the Thousand Brains Project, an ongoing research effort to develop an alternative, complementary form of AI, derived from the operating principles of the neocortex. We present an early version of a thousand-brains system, a sensorimotor agent that is uniquely suited to quickly learn a wide range of tasks and eventually implement any capabilities the human neocortex has. Core to its design is the use of a repeating computational unit, the learning module, modeled on the cortical columns found in mammalian brains. Each learning module operates as a semi-independent unit that can model entire objects, represents information through spatially structured reference frames, and both estimates and is able to effect movement in the world. Learning is a quick, associative process, similar to Hebbian learning in the brain, and leverages inductive biases around the spatial structure of the world to enable rapid and continual learning. Multiple learning modules can interact with one another both hierarchically and non-hierarchically via a "cortical messaging protocol" (CMP), creating more abstract representations and supporting multimodal integration. We outline the key principles motivating the design of thousand-brains systems and provide details about the implementation of Monty, our first instantiation of such a system.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tenghui Li, Guoxu Zhou, Xuyang Zhao, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling capability has been widely validated with respect to the number of parameters and the size of training data. One important question that is unexplored is that does scaling capability also exists similarly with respect to the number of vision tokens? This study fills the gap by investigating the relationship between the number of vision tokens and the performance of vision-language models. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations reveal that the model exhibits weak scaling capabilities on the length \(N_l\), with performance approximately \(S(N_l) \approx (c/N_l)^{\alpha}\), where \(c, \alpha\) are hyperparameters. Interestingly, this scaling behavior remains largely unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the user's question in the input. Furthermore, fusing the user's question with the vision token can enhance model performance when the question is relevant to the task. To address the computational challenges associated with large-scale vision tokens, we propose a novel architecture that efficiently reduces the token count while integrating user question tokens into the representation. Our findings may offer insights for developing more efficient and effective vision-language models under specific task constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine cyber and physical components engineered to make decisions and interact within dynamic environments. Ensuring the safety of CPS is of great importance, requiring extensive testing across diverse and complex scenarios. To generate as many testing scenarios as possible, previous efforts have focused on describing scenarios using formal languages to generate scenes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach: reconstructing scenes inside the open-source game engine, Godot. We have developed a pipeline that enables the reconstruction of testing scenes directly from provided images of scenarios. These reconstructed scenes can then be deployed within simulated environments to assess a CPS. This approach offers a scalable and flexible solution for testing CPS in realistic environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: As social changes accelerate, the incidence of psychosomatic disorders has significantly increased, becoming a major challenge in global health issues. This necessitates an innovative knowledge system and analytical methods to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we establish the ontology model and entity types, using the BERT model and LoRA-tuned LLM for named entity recognition, constructing the knowledge graph with 9668 triples. Next, by analyzing the network distances between disease, symptom, and drug modules, it was found that closer network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in their clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological mechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more likely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score, it was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships have a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in diagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential connections between diseases, co-occurring symptoms, and similarities in treatment strategies, providing new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of psychosomatic disorders and valuable information for future mental health research and practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) have improved the document understanding capabilities remarkably, enabling the handling of complex document elements, longer contexts, and a wider range of tasks. However, existing document understanding benchmarks have been limited to handling only a small number of pages and fail to provide a comprehensive analysis of layout elements locating. In this paper, we first define three primary task categories: Long Document Understanding, numerical Reasoning, and cross-element Locating, and then propose a comprehensive benchmark, LongDocURL, integrating above three primary tasks and comprising 20 sub-tasks categorized based on different primary tasks and answer evidences. Furthermore, we develop a semi-automated construction pipeline and collect 2,325 high-quality question-answering pairs, covering more than 33,000 pages of documents, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks. Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive evaluation experiments on both open-source and closed-source models across 26 different configurations, revealing critical performance gaps in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nowadays, research on GUI agents is a hot topic in the AI community. However, current research focuses on GUI task automation, limiting the scope of applications in various GUI scenarios. In this paper, we propose a formalized and comprehensive environment to evaluate the entire process of automated GUI Testing (GTArena), offering a fair, standardized environment for consistent operation of diverse multimodal large language models. We divide the testing process into three key subtasks: test intention generation, test task execution, and GUI defect detection, and construct a benchmark dataset based on these to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. It evaluates the performance of different models using three data types: real mobile applications, mobile applications with artificially injected defects, and synthetic data, thoroughly assessing their capabilities in this relevant task. Additionally, we propose a method that helps researchers explore the correlation between the performance of multimodal language large models in specific scenarios and their general capabilities in standard benchmark tests. Experimental results indicate that even the most advanced models struggle to perform well across all sub-tasks of automated GUI Testing, highlighting a significant gap between the current capabilities of Autonomous GUI Testing and its practical, real-world applicability. This gap provides guidance for the future direction of GUI Agent development. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/ChatUITest.</p>

<p>Abstract: International enterprises, organizations, or hospitals collect large amounts of multi-modal data stored in databases, text documents, images, and videos. While there has been recent progress in the separate fields of multi-modal data exploration as well as in database systems that automatically translate natural language questions to database query languages, the research challenge of querying database systems combined with other unstructured modalities such as images in natural language is widely unexplored.
  In this paper, we propose XMODE - a system that enables explainable, multi-modal data exploration in natural language. Our approach is based on the following research contributions: (1) Our system is inspired by a real-world use case that enables users to explore multi-modal information systems. (2) XMODE leverages a LLM-based agentic AI framework to decompose a natural language question into subtasks such as text-to-SQL generation and image analysis. (3) Experimental results on multi-modal datasets over relational data and images demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal exploration systems, excelling not only in accuracy but also in various performance metrics such as query latency, API costs, planning efficiency, and explanation quality, thanks to the more effective utilization of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

The nature of the medical norm system and its sharing channels necessitates distinct approaches for Multi-Agent Systems to learn two types of norms. Building on this foundation, the model enables agents to simultaneously learn descriptive norms, which capture collective tendencies, and prescriptive norms, which dictate ideal behaviors. Through parameterized mixed probability density models and practice-enhanced Markov games, the multi-agent system perceives descriptive norms in dynamic interactions and captures emergent prescriptive norms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengfei He, Xiao Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Social segregation in cities, spanning racial, residential, and income dimensions, is becoming more diverse and severe. As urban spaces and social relations grow more complex, residents in metropolitan areas experience varying levels of social segregation. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased crime rates, heightened social tensions, and other serious issues. Effectively quantifying and analyzing the structures within urban spaces and resident interactions is crucial for addressing segregation. Previous studies have mainly focused on surface-level indicators of urban segregation, lacking comprehensive analyses of urban structure and mobility. This limitation fails to capture the full complexity of segregation. To address this gap, we propose a framework named Motif-Enhanced Graph Prototype Learning (MotifGPL),which consists of three key modules: prototype-based graph structure extraction, motif distribution discovery, and urban graph structure reconstruction. Specifically, we use graph structure prototype learning to extract key prototypes from both the urban spatial graph and the origin-destination graph, incorporating key urban attributes such as points of interest, street view images, and flow indices. To enhance interpretability, the motif distribution discovery module matches each prototype with similar motifs, representing simpler graph structures reflecting local patterns. Finally, we use the motif distribution results to guide the reconstruction of the two graphs. This model enables a detailed exploration of urban spatial structures and resident mobility patterns, helping identify and analyze motif patterns that influence urban segregation, guiding the reconstruction of urban graph structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MotifGPL effectively reveals the key motifs affecting urban social segregation and offer robust guidance for mitigating this issue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Alex O. Vasilescu</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a set of causal deep neural networks whose architectures are a consequence of tensor (multilinear) factor analysis, a framework that facilitates forward and inverse causal inference. Forward causal questions are addressed with a neural architecture composed of causal capsules and a tensor transformer. Causal capsules compute a set of invariant causal factor representations, whose interactions are governed by a tensor transformation. Inverse causal questions are addressed with a neural network that implements the multilinear projection algorithm. The architecture reverses the order of the operations of a forward neural network and estimates the causes of effects. As an alternative to aggressive bottleneck dimension reduction or regularized regression that may camouflage an inherently underdetermined inverse problem, we prescribe modeling different aspects of the mechanism of data formation with piecewise tensor models whose multilinear projections produce multiple candidate solutions. Our forward and inverse questions may be addressed with shallow architectures, but for computationally scalable solutions, we derive a set of deep neural networks by taking advantage of block algebra. An interleaved kernel hierarchy results in a doubly non-linear tensor factor models. The causal neural networks that are a consequence of tensor factor analysis are data agnostic, but are illustrated with facial images. Sequential, parallel and asynchronous parallel computation strategies are described.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotic object packing has broad practical applications in the logistics and automation industry, often formulated by researchers as the online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). However, existing DRL-based methods primarily focus on enhancing performance in limited packing environments while neglecting the ability to generalize across multiple environments characterized by different bin dimensions. To this end, we propose GOPT, a generalizable online 3D Bin Packing approach via Transformer-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, we design a Placement Generator module to yield finite subspaces as placement candidates and the representation of the bin. Second, we propose a Packing Transformer, which fuses the features of the items and bin, to identify the spatial correlation between the item to be packed and available sub-spaces within the bin. Coupling these two components enables GOPT's ability to perform inference on bins of varying dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that GOPT not only achieves superior performance against the baselines, but also exhibits excellent generalization capabilities. Furthermore, the deployment with a robot showcases the practical applicability of our method in the real world. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Xiong5Heng/GOPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghav Ramji, Keshav Ramji</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their linguistic reasoning capabilities is an important task to understand the gaps in their skills that may surface during large-scale adoption. In this work, we investigate the abilities of such models to perform abstract multilingual reasoning through the lens of linguistic puzzles on extremely low-resource languages. As these translation tasks involve inductive and deductive reasoning from reference instances, we examine whether diverse auxiliary demonstrations can be automatically induced from seed exemplars, through analogical prompting. We employ a two-stage procedure, first generating analogical exemplars with a language model, and then applying them in-context along with provided target language exemplars. Our results on the modeLing dataset show that analogical prompting is effective in eliciting models' knowledge of language grammar similarities, boosting the performance of GPT-4o by as much as 8.1% and Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct by 5.9% over chain-of-thought approaches. These gains are attributable to the analogical demonstrations, both when self-generated as well as when produced by weaker multilingual models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method generalizes to other tasks present in Linguistics Olympiad competitions, achieving sizable improvements across all problem types and difficulty levels included in the LINGOLY dataset with GPT-4o. We also report several findings about interesting phenomena which drive linguistic reasoning performance, suggesting that such puzzles are a valuable benchmark for new reasoning methods.</p>

This paradox captures how such LLMs can excel in highly specialized fields but do poorly on tasks which require general, everyday knowledge. This paper formalizes the definition of the Rosetta Paradox and introduces a panoramic analysis framework that includes both a Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and a Performance Inversion Metric (PIM) for consistent quantification of domain-specific behavior in LLMs.
  We adopt this paradox and conduct a series of investigations through extensive experiments across diverse models and knowledge domains, ranging from rich technical areas to common-sense reasoning. Our findings indicate that the Rosetta Paradox is likely not a mere artifact of data distribution but an intrinsic architectural and emergent property of deep neural networks. We present comparative analyses across different model architectures, sizes, and training methodologies that shed light into the peculiar ways this paradox manifests itself and challenge the standard evaluation metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Shazaib Shah, Tan Daoliang, Sah Chandan Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm operation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of wind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to provide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning, limiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric attention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby minimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are proposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimation of patient acuity in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is vital to ensure timely and appropriate interventions. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have significantly improved the accuracy of acuity predictions. However, prior studies using machine learning for acuity prediction have predominantly relied on electronic health records (EHR) data, often overlooking other critical aspects of ICU stay, such as patient mobility, environmental factors, and facial cues indicating pain or agitation. To address this gap, we present MANGO: the Multimodal Acuity traNsformer for intelliGent ICU Outcomes, designed to enhance the prediction of patient acuity states, transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapy. We collected a multimodal dataset ICU-Multimodal, incorporating four key modalities, EHR data, wearable sensor data, video of patient's facial cues, and ambient sensor data, which we utilized to train MANGO. The MANGO model employs a multimodal feature fusion network powered by Transformer masked self-attention method, enabling it to capture and learn complex interactions across these diverse data modalities even when some modalities are absent. Our results demonstrated that integrating multiple modalities significantly improved the model's ability to predict acuity status, transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapy. The best-performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72-0.79) for predicting transitions in acuity status and the need for life-sustaining therapy, while 0.82 (95% CI: 0.69-0.89) for acuity status prediction...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Flores, Marcelo Contreras, Ichiro Macedo, Javier Andreu-Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning advancements have boosted Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) performance, but their wide-scale applicability is limited due to factors like individual health, hardware variations, and cultural differences affecting neural data. Studies often focus on uniform single-site experiments in uniform settings, leading to high performance that may not translate well to real-world diversity. Deep learning models aim to enhance BCI classification accuracy, and transfer learning has been suggested to adapt models to individual neural patterns using a base model trained on others' data. This approach promises better generalizability and reduced overfitting, yet challenges remain in handling diverse and imbalanced datasets from different equipment, subjects, multiple centres in different countries, and both healthy and patient populations for effective model transfer and tuning.
  In a setting characterized by maximal heterogeneity, we proposed P300 wave detection in BCIs employing a convolutional neural network fitted with adaptive transfer learning based on Poison Sampling Disk (PDS) called Active Sampling (AS), which flexibly adjusts the transition from source data to the target domain. Our results reported for subject adaptive with 40% of adaptive fine-tuning that the averaged classification accuracy improved by 5.36% and standard deviation reduced by 12.22% using two distinct, internationally replicated datasets. These results outperformed in classification accuracy, computational time, and training efficiency, mainly due to the proposed Active Sampling (AS) method for transfer learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuyi Wang, Huan Zhao, Yuji Cao, Zibin Pan, Guolong Liu, Gaoqi Liang, Junhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Wind Storage Integrated System with Power Smoothing Control (PSC) has emerged as a promising solution to ensure both efficient and reliable wind energy generation. However, existing PSC strategies overlook the intricate interplay and distinct control frequencies between batteries and wind turbines, and lack consideration of wake effect and battery degradation cost. In this paper, a novel coordinated control framework with hierarchical levels is devised to address these challenges effectively, which integrates the wake model and battery degradation model. In addition, after reformulating the problem as a Markov decision process, the multi-agent reinforcement learning method is introduced to overcome the bi-level characteristic of the problem. Moreover, a Physics-informed Neural Network-assisted Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PAMA-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to incorporate the power fluctuation differential equation and expedite the learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulations conducted in four distinct scenarios using WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm facilitates approximately an 11% increase in total profit and a 19% decrease in power fluctuation compared to the traditional methods, thereby addressing the dual objectives of economic efficiency and grid-connected energy reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent rise of semantic-style communications includes the development of goal-oriented communications (GOCOMs) remarkably efficient multimedia information transmissions. The concept of GO-COMS leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools to address the rising demand for bandwidth efficiency in applications, such as edge computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Unlike traditional communication systems focusing on source data accuracy, GO-COMs provide intelligent message delivery catering to the special needs critical to accomplishing downstream tasks at the receiver. In this work, we present a novel GO-COM framework, namely LaMI-GO that utilizes emerging generative AI for better quality-of-service (QoS) with ultra-high communication efficiency. Specifically, we design our LaMI-GO system backbone based on a latent diffusion model followed by a vector-quantized generative adversarial network (VQGAN) for efficient latent embedding and information representation. The system trains a common feature codebook the receiver side. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvement in perceptual quality, accuracy of downstream tasks, and bandwidth consumption over the state-of-the-art GOCOM systems and establish the power of our proposed LaMI-GO communication framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindya Sarkar, Alex DiChristofano, Sanmay Das, Patrick J. Fowler, Nathan Jacobs, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik</p>
<p>Abstract: Tenant evictions threaten housing stability and are a major concern for many cities. An open question concerns whether data-driven methods enhance outreach programs that target at-risk tenants to mitigate their risk of eviction. We propose a novel active geospatial search (AGS) modeling framework for this problem. AGS integrates property-level information in a search policy that identifies a sequence of rental units to canvas to both determine their eviction risk and provide support if needed. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to learn a search policy for AGS that scales to large urban areas containing thousands of parcels, balancing exploration and exploitation and accounting for travel costs and a budget constraint. Crucially, the search policy adapts online to newly discovered information about evictions. Evaluation using eviction data for a large urban area demonstrates that the proposed framework and algorithmic approach are considerably more effective at sequentially identifying eviction cases than baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziming Guo, Chao Ma, Yinggang Sun, Tiancheng Zhao, Guangyao Wang, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q\&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhang Shi, Yiren Chen, Shuqing Bian, Xinyi Zhang, Zhe Zhao, Pengfei Hu, Wei Lu, Xiaoyong Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge stored in large language models requires timely updates to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world information. To update the knowledge, most knowledge editing methods focus on the low layers, since recent probes into the knowledge recall process reveal that the answer information is enriched in low layers. However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages for the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's prediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the probe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate the inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a contrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model behavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information Enrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers. Building upon the insights, we develop the Joint knowledge Editing for information Enrichment and probability Promotion (JEEP) method, which jointly edits both the low and high layers to modify the two critical recall stages. Considering the mutual interference and growing forgetting due to dual modifications, JEEP is designed to ensure that updates to distinct regions share the same objectives and are complementary. We rigorously evaluate JEEP by editing up to thousands of facts on various models, i.e., GPT-J (6B) and LLaMA (7B), and addressing diverse editing objectives, i.e., adding factual and counterfactual knowledge. In all tested scenarios, JEEP achieves best performances, validating the effectiveness of the revealings of our probe approach and the designs of our editing method.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and apply Operations Research Question Answering (ORQA), a new benchmark designed to assess the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the specialized technical domain of Operations Research (OR). This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs can emulate the knowledge and reasoning skills of OR experts when confronted with diverse and complex optimization problems. The dataset, developed by OR experts, features real-world optimization problems that demand multistep reasoning to construct their mathematical models. Our evaluations of various open source LLMs, such as LLaMA 3.1, DeepSeek, and Mixtral, reveal their modest performance, highlighting a gap in their ability to generalize to specialized technical domains. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on LLMs generalization capabilities, offering valuable insights for future research in this area.

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning in scientific research has created a fundamental tension between model opacity and scientific understanding. Whilst some advocate for intrinsically interpretable models, we introduce Computational Interpretabilism (CI) as a philosophical framework for post-hoc interpretability in scientific AI. Drawing parallels with human expertise, where post-hoc rationalisation coexists with reliable performance, CI establishes that scientific knowledge emerges through structured model interpretation when properly bounded by empirical validation. Through mediated understanding and bounded factivity, we demonstrate how post-hoc methods achieve epistemically justified insights without requiring complete mechanical transparency, resolving tensions between model complexity and scientific comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emilie Chouzenoux, Cecile Della Valle, Jean-Christophe Pesquet</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a neural network architecture designed to solve inverse problems where the degradation operator is linear and known. This architecture is constructed by unrolling a forward-backward algorithm derived from the minimization of an objective function that combines a data-fidelity term, a Tikhonov-type regularization term, and a potentially nonsmooth convex penalty. The robustness of this inversion method to input perturbations is analyzed theoretically. Ensuring robustness complies with the principles of inverse problem theory, as it ensures both the continuity of the inversion method and the resilience to small noise - a critical property given the known vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations. A key novelty of our work lies in examining the robustness of the proposed network to perturbations in its bias, which represents the observed data in the inverse problem. Additionally, we provide numerical illustrations of the analytical Lipschitz bounds derived in our analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzhang Cai, Twumasi Mensah-Boateng, Xander Kuksov, Jing Yuan, Shaojie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities across a broad range of language-related tasks, including generating solutions to complex reasoning problems. An effective technique to enhance LLM performance is in-context learning, which encourages a step-by-step reasoning process by including explanatory examples to guide the model's responses. However, selecting appropriate exemplars for the model poses a challenge, as each dataset demands a distinct set of exemplars to enable the LLM to learn effectively and perform well on the test set. Current studies often rely on uncertainty- or diversity-based selection strategies to select exemplars for annotation and to improve model learning. However, these studies typically employ a non-adaptive approach, selecting a set of exemplars all at once. We argue that this non-adaptive strategy may result in a set of exemplars with high redundancy in terms of the knowledge covered, ultimately reducing their overall informativeness. To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{Adaptive-Prompt}, a novel method that adaptively selects exemplars by leveraging model feedback from previously chosen exemplars. Experimental results show that \textsc{Adaptive-Prompt} significantly enhances LLM performance across a variety of reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepthi Pavurala, Duoduo Liao, Chaithra Reddy Pasunuru</p>
<p>Abstract: This pilot study presents a novel, automated, and scalable methodology for detecting and evaluating subsurface defect-prone regions in concrete slabs using Impact Echo (IE) signal analysis. The approach integrates advanced signal processing, clustering, and visual analytics to identify subsurface anomalies. A unique adaptive thresholding method tailors frequency-based defect identification to the distinct material properties of each slab. The methodology generates frequency maps, binary masks, and k-means cluster maps to automatically classify defect and non-defect regions. Key visualizations, including 3D surface plots, cluster maps, and contour plots, are employed to analyze spatial frequency distributions and highlight structural anomalies. The study utilizes a labeled dataset constructed at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Advanced Sensing Technology Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory. Evaluations involve ground-truth masking, comparing the generated defect maps with top-view binary masks derived from the information provided by the FHWA. The performance metrics, specifically F1-scores and AUC-ROC, achieve values of up to 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. The results demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, consistently identifying defect-prone areas with minimal false positives and few missed defects. Adaptive frequency thresholding ensures flexibility in addressing variations across slabs, providing a scalable framework for detecting structural anomalies. Additionally, the methodology is adaptable to other frequency-based signals due to its generalizable thresholding mechanism and holds potential for integrating multimodal sensor fusion. This automated and scalable pipeline minimizes manual intervention, ensuring accurate and efficient defect detection, further advancing Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: $\textit{ArchComplete}$ is a two-stage dense voxel-based 3D generative pipeline developed to tackle the high complexity in architectural geometries and topologies, assisting with ideation and geometric detailisation in the early design process. In stage 1, a $\textit{3D Voxel VQGAN}$ model is devised, whose composition is then modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse models. Subsequently, in stage 2, $\textit{Hierarchical Voxel Upsampling Networks}$ consisting of a set of 3D conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models are defined to augment the coarse shapes with fine geometric details. The first stage is trained on a dataset of house models with fully modelled exteriors and interiors with a novel 2.5D perceptual loss to capture input complexities across multiple abstraction levels, while the second stage trains on randomly cropped local volumetric patches, requiring significantly less compute and memory. For inference, the pipeline first autoregressively generates house models at a resolution of $64^3$ and then progressively refines them to resolution of $256^3$ with voxel sizes as small as $18\text{cm}$. ArchComplete supports a range of interaction modes solving a variety of tasks, including interpolation, variation generation, unconditional synthesis, and two conditional synthesis tasks: shape completion and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation. The results demonstrate notable improvements against state-of-the-art on established metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Breast cancer detection based on pre-trained convolution neural network (CNN) has gained much interest among other conventional computer-based systems. In the past few years, CNN technology has been the most promising way to find cancer in mammogram scans. In this paper, the effect of layer freezing in a pre-trained CNN is investigated for breast cancer detection by classifying mammogram images as benign or malignant. Different VGG19 scenarios have been examined based on the number of convolution layer blocks that have been frozen. There are a total of six scenarios in this study. The primary benefits of this research are twofold: it improves the model's ability to detect breast cancer cases and it reduces the training time of VGG19 by freezing certain layers.To evaluate the performance of these scenarios, 1693 microbiological images of benign and malignant breast cancers were utilized. According to the reported results, the best recognition rate was obtained from a frozen first block of VGG19 with a sensitivity of 95.64 %, while the training of the entire VGG19 yielded 94.48%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automating high-volume unstructured data processing is essential for operational efficiency. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is critical but often struggles with accuracy and efficiency in complex layouts and ambiguous text. These challenges are especially pronounced in large-scale tasks requiring both speed and precision. This paper introduces LMV-RPA, a Large Model Voting-based Robotic Process Automation system to enhance OCR workflows. LMV-RPA integrates outputs from OCR engines such as Paddle OCR, Tesseract OCR, Easy OCR, and DocTR with Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA 3 and Gemini-1.5-pro. Using a majority voting mechanism, it processes OCR outputs into structured JSON formats, improving accuracy, particularly in complex layouts. The multi-phase pipeline processes text extracted by OCR engines through LLMs, combining results to ensure the most accurate outputs. LMV-RPA achieves 99 percent accuracy in OCR tasks, surpassing baseline models with 94 percent, while reducing processing time by 80 percent. Benchmark evaluations confirm its scalability and demonstrate that LMV-RPA offers a faster, more reliable, and efficient solution for automating large-scale document processing tasks.</p>

We introduce two variants of tuGEMM, serial and parallel, with distinct area/power-latency trade-offs. Post-synthesis Power-Performance-Area (PPA) in 45 nm CMOS are reported for 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit computations. The designs illustrate significant advantages in area-power efficiency over state-of-the-art stochastic unary systems especially at low precisions, e.g. incurring just 0.03 mm^2 and 9 mW for 4 bits, and 0.01 mm^2 and 4 mW for 2 bits. This makes tuGEMM ideal for power constrained mobile and edge devices performing always-on real-time sensory processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pivotal in advancing mobile network systems by facilitating smart capabilities and automation. The transition from 4G to 5G has substantial implications for AI in consolidating a network predominantly geared towards business verticals. In this context, 3GPP has specified and introduced the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) entity at the network's core to provide insights based on AI algorithms to benefit network orchestration. This paper proposes a framework for evolving NWDAF that presents the interfaces necessary to further empower the core network with AI capabilities B5G and 6G. In addition, we identify a set of research directions for realizing a distributed e-NWDAF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor J\'unio Alc\^antara Cardoso, Rodrigo Moreira, Jo\~ao Fernando Mari, Larissa Ferreira Rodrigues Moreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Sickle cell anemia, which is characterized by abnormal erythrocyte morphology, can be detected using microscopic images. Computational techniques in medicine enhance the diagnosis and treatment efficiency. However, many computational techniques, particularly those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), require high resources and time for training, highlighting the research opportunities in methods with low computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach combining conventional classifiers, segmented images, and CNNs for the automated classification of sickle cell disease. We evaluated the impact of segmented images on classification, providing insight into deep learning integration. Our results demonstrate that using segmented images and CNN features with an SVM achieves an accuracy of 96.80%. This finding is relevant for computationally efficient scenarios, paving the way for future research and advancements in medical-image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prabhu Vellaisamy, Harideep Nair, Vamsikrishna Ratnakaram, Dhruv Gupta, John Paul Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs), a special class of spiking neural networks, draw inspiration from the neocortex in utilizing spike-timings for information processing. Recent works proposed a microarchitecture framework and custom macro suite for designing highly energy-efficient application-specific TNNs. These recent works rely on manual hardware design, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Further, there is no open-source functional simulation framework for TNNs. This paper introduces TNNGen, a pioneering effort towards the automated design of TNNs from PyTorch software models to post-layout netlists. TNNGen comprises a novel PyTorch functional simulator (for TNN modeling and application exploration) coupled with a Python-based hardware generator (for PyTorch-to-RTL and RTL-to-Layout conversions). Seven representative TNN designs for time-series signal clustering across diverse sensory modalities are simulated and their post-layout hardware complexity and design runtimes are assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of TNNGen. We also highlight TNNGen's ability to accurately forecast silicon metrics without running hardware process flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhao Liang, Jacob K. Christopher, Sven Koenig, Ferdinando Fioretto</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents moving from their respective start to goal positions. Coordinating multiple agents in a shared environment poses significant challenges, especially in continuous spaces where traditional optimization algorithms struggle with scalability. Moreover, these algorithms often depend on discretized representations of the environment, which can be impractical in image-based or high-dimensional settings. Recently, diffusion models have shown promise in single-agent path planning, capturing complex trajectory distributions and generating smooth paths that navigate continuous, high-dimensional spaces. However, directly extending diffusion models to MAPF introduces new challenges since these models struggle to ensure constraint feasibility, such as inter-agent collision avoidance. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel approach that integrates constrained optimization with diffusion models for MAPF in continuous spaces. This unique combination directly produces feasible multi-agent trajectories that respect collision avoidance and kinematic constraints. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated across various challenging simulated scenarios of varying dimensionality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radio remains a pervasive medium for mass information dissemination, with AM/FM stations reaching more Americans than either smartphone-based social networking or live television. Increasingly, radio broadcasts are also streamed online and accessed over the Internet. We present WavePulse, a framework that records, documents, and analyzes radio content in real-time. While our framework is generally applicable, we showcase the efficacy of WavePulse in a collaborative project with a team of political scientists focusing on the 2024 Presidential Elections. We use WavePulse to monitor livestreams of 396 news radio stations over a period of three months, processing close to 500,000 hours of audio streams. These streams were converted into time-stamped, diarized transcripts and analyzed to track answer key political science questions at both the national and state levels. Our analysis revealed how local issues interacted with national trends, providing insights into information flow. Our results demonstrate WavePulse's efficacy in capturing and analyzing content from radio livestreams sourced from the Web. Code and dataset can be accessed at \url{https://wave-pulse.io}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Imran Pervez, Ricardo Pinto Lima, Omar Knio</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p>

This is to reduce plausible but faulty LLM outputs (a.k.a hallucinations) and meet the highly increased inference demands. This tutorial explores such efforts and makes them transparent to the database community. Understanding these efforts is essential in harnessing LLMs in database tasks and adapting database techniques to LLMs. Furthermore, we delve into the synergy between LLMs and databases, highlighting new opportunities and challenges in their intersection. This tutorial aims to share with database researchers and practitioners essential concepts and strategies around LLMs, reduce the unfamiliarity of LLMs, and inspire joining in the intersection between LLMs and databases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Beyond mere formality, small talk plays a pivotal role in social dynamics, serving as a verbal handshake for building rapport and understanding. For conversational AI and social robots, the ability to engage in small talk enhances their perceived sociability, leading to more comfortable and natural user interactions. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of current Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive the small talk of a social robot and identify key areas for improvement. We introduce a novel method that autonomously generates feedback and ensures LLM-generated responses align with small talk conventions. Through several evaluations -- involving chatbot interactions and human-robot interactions -- we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in guiding LLM-generated responses toward realistic, human-like, and natural small-talk exchanges.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks are widely regarded as black-box models, creating significant challenges in understanding their inner workings, especially in natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this opacity, model explanation techniques like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) have emerged as essential tools for providing insights into the behavior of these complex systems. This study leverages LIME to interpret a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on a text classification task. By analyzing the contribution of individual features to model predictions, the LIME approach enhances interpretability and supports informed decision-making. Despite its effectiveness in offering localized explanations, LIME has limitations in capturing global patterns and feature interactions. This research highlights the strengths and shortcomings of LIME and proposes directions for future work to achieve more comprehensive interpretability in neural NLP models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial in applications such as autonomous driving or service robotics, to name a few. Deep generative models achieve top performance in this task, assuming enough labelled trajectories are available for training. To this end, large amounts of synthetically generated, labelled trajectories exist (e.g., generated by video games). However, such trajectories are not meant to represent pedestrian motion realistically and are ineffective at training a predictive model. We propose a method and an architecture to augment synthetic trajectories at training time and with an adversarial approach. We show that trajectory augmentation at training time unleashes significant gains when a state-of-the-art generative model is evaluated over real-world trajectories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tensor Attention extends traditional attention mechanisms by capturing high-order correlations across multiple modalities, addressing the limitations of classical matrix-based attention. Meanwhile, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has shown superior performance in encoding positional information in long-context scenarios, significantly enhancing transformer models' expressiveness. Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical limitations of these technologies remain underexplored. In this study, we analyze the circuit complexity of Tensor Attention and $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention, showing that with polynomial precision, constant-depth layers, and linear or sublinear hidden dimension, they cannot solve fixed membership problems or $(A_{F,r})^*$ closure problems, under the assumption that $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. These findings highlight a gap between the empirical performance and theoretical constraints of Tensor Attention and $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention Transformers, offering insights that could guide the development of more theoretically grounded approaches to Transformer model design and scaling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clinical coding is crucial for healthcare billing and data analysis. Manual clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer eight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation methods. Additionally, we propose new AI-based methods beyond automated coding, suggesting alternative approaches to assist clinical coders in their workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emojis are widely used across social media platforms but are often lost in noisy or garbled text, posing challenges for data analysis and machine learning. Conventional preprocessing approaches recommend removing such text, risking the loss of emojis and their contextual meaning. This paper proposes a three-step reverse-engineering methodology to retrieve emojis from garbled text in social media posts. The methodology also identifies reasons for the generation of such text during social media data mining. To evaluate its effectiveness, the approach was applied to 509,248 Tweets about the Mpox outbreak, a dataset referenced in about 30 prior works that failed to retrieve emojis from garbled text. Our method retrieved 157,748 emojis from 76,914 Tweets. Improvements in text readability and coherence were demonstrated through metrics such as Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, Dale-Chall Readability Score, Text Standard, and Reading Time. Additionally, the frequency of individual emojis and their patterns of usage in these Tweets were analyzed, and the results are presented.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only effectively reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience of handling practical issues, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. However, existing EV charging strategies have yet to fully consider these factors in a way that benefits both office buildings and EV users simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and electric vehicles. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, a new critic augmentation is introduced to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information.</p>

<p>Abstract: In second-language acquisition, predictive modeling aids educators in implementing diverse teaching strategies, attracting significant research attention. However, while model accuracy is widely explored, model fairness remains under-examined. Model fairness ensures equitable treatment of groups, preventing unintentional biases based on attributes such as gender, ethnicity, or economic background. A fair model should produce impartial outcomes that do not systematically disadvantage any group.
  This study evaluates the fairness of two predictive models using the Duolingo dataset's en\_es (English learners speaking Spanish), es\_en (Spanish learners speaking English), and fr\_en (French learners speaking English) tracks. We analyze: 1. Algorithmic fairness across platforms (iOS, Android, Web). 2. Algorithmic fairness between developed and developing countries.
  Key findings include: 1. Deep learning outperforms machine learning in second-language knowledge tracing due to improved accuracy and fairness. 2. Both models favor mobile users over non-mobile users. 3. Machine learning exhibits stronger bias against developing countries compared to deep learning. 4. Deep learning strikes a better balance of fairness and accuracy in the en\_es and es\_en tracks, while machine learning is more suitable for fr\_en.
  This study highlights the importance of addressing fairness in predictive models to ensure equitable educational strategies across platforms and regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francois Chaubard, Duncan Eddy, Mykel J. Kochenderfer</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Gradient Agreement Filtering (GAF) to improve on gradient averaging in distributed deep learning optimization. Traditional distributed data-parallel stochastic gradient descent involves averaging gradients of microbatches to calculate a macrobatch gradient that is then used to update model parameters. We find that gradients across microbatches are often orthogonal or negatively correlated, especially in late stages of training, which leads to memorization of the training set, reducing generalization. In this paper, we introduce a simple, computationally effective way to reduce gradient variance by computing the cosine distance between micro-gradients during training and filtering out conflicting updates prior to averaging. We improve validation accuracy with significantly smaller microbatch sizes. We also show this reduces memorizing noisy labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on standard image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-100N-Fine. We show this technique consistently outperforms validation accuracy, in some cases by up to 18.2\% compared to traditional training approaches while reducing the computation required nearly an order of magnitude because we can now rely on smaller microbatch sizes without destabilizing training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although neurons in the feed-forward layers of pre-trained language models (PLMs) can store factual knowledge, most prior analyses remain qualitative, leaving the quantitative relationship among knowledge representation, neuron activations, and model output poorly understood. In this study, by performing neuron-wise interventions using factual probing datasets, we first reveal the linear relationship between neuron activations and output token probabilities. We refer to the gradient of this linear relationship as ``neuron empirical gradients.'' and propose NeurGrad, an efficient method for their calculation to facilitate quantitative neuron analysis. We next investigate whether neuron empirical gradients in PLMs encode general task knowledge by probing skill neurons. To this end, we introduce MCEval8k, a multi-choice knowledge evaluation benchmark spanning six genres and 22 tasks. Our experiments confirm that neuron empirical gradients effectively capture knowledge, while skill neurons exhibit efficiency, generality, inclusivity, and interdependency. These findings link knowledge to PLM outputs via neuron empirical gradients, shedding light on how PLMs store knowledge. The code and dataset are released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Combinatorial libraries are a powerful approach for exploring the evolution of physical properties across binary and ternary cross-sections in multicomponent phase diagrams. Although the synthesis of these libraries has been developed since the 1960s and expedited with advanced laboratory automation, the broader application of combinatorial libraries relies on fast, reliable measurements of concentration-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning Probe Microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer significant potential for quantitative, functionally relevant combi-library readouts. Here we demonstrate the implementation of fully automated SPM to explore the evolution of ferroelectric properties in combinatorial libraries, focusing on Sm-doped BiFeO3 and ZnxMg1-xO systems. We also present and compare Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization models for fully automated exploration, emphasizing local reproducibility (effective noise) as an essential factor in optimal experiment workflows. Automated SPM, when coupled with upstream synthesis controls, plays a pivotal role in bridging materials synthesis and characterization.</p>

<p>Abstract: With advances in foundational and vision-language models, and effective fine-tuning techniques, a large number of both general and special-purpose models have been developed for a variety of visual tasks. Despite the flexibility and accessibility of these models, no single model is able to handle all tasks and/or applications that may be envisioned by potential users. Recent approaches, such as visual programming and multimodal LLMs with integrated tools aim to tackle complex visual tasks, by way of program synthesis. However, such approaches overlook user constraints (e.g., performance / computational needs), produce test-time sample-specific solutions that are difficult to deploy, and, sometimes, require low-level instructions that maybe beyond the abilities of a naive user. To address these limitations, we introduce MMFactory, a universal framework that includes model and metrics routing components, acting like a solution search engine across various available models. Based on a task description and few sample input-output pairs and (optionally) resource and/or performance constraints, MMFactory can suggest a diverse pool of programmatic solutions by instantiating and combining visio-lingual tools from its model repository. In addition to synthesizing these solutions, MMFactory also proposes metrics and benchmarks performance / resource characteristics, allowing users to pick a solution that meets their unique design constraints. From the technical perspective, we also introduced a committee-based solution proposer that leverages multi-agent LLM conversation to generate executable, diverse, universal, and robust solutions for the user. Experimental results show that MMFactory outperforms existing methods by delivering state-of-the-art solutions tailored to user problem specifications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Liu, Xin Ma, Xiaochen Yang, Yuxiang Zhang, Yanni Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-modal object detection tasks often experience performance degradation when encountering diverse scenarios. In contrast, multimodal object detection tasks can offer more comprehensive information about object features by integrating data from various modalities. Current multimodal object detection methods generally use various fusion techniques, including conventional neural networks and transformer-based models, to implement feature fusion strategies and achieve complementary information. However, since multimodal images are captured by different sensors, there are often misalignments between them, making direct matching challenging. This misalignment hinders the ability to establish strong correlations for the same object across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the CrOss-Mamba interaction and Offset-guided fusion (COMO) framework for multimodal object detection tasks. The COMO framework employs the cross-mamba technique to formulate feature interaction equations, enabling multimodal serialized state computation. This results in interactive fusion outputs while reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency. Additionally, COMO leverages high-level features, which are less affected by misalignment, to facilitate interaction and transfer complementary information between modalities, addressing the positional offset challenges caused by variations in camera angles and capture times. Furthermore, COMO incorporates a global and local scanning mechanism in the cross-mamba module to capture features with local correlation, particularly in remote sensing images. To preserve low-level features, the offset-guided fusion mechanism ensures effective multiscale feature utilization, allowing the construction of a multiscale fusion data cube that enhances detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuezihan Jiang, Gaode Chen, Wenhan Zhang, Jingchi Wang, Yinjie Jiang, Qi Zhang, Jingjian Lin, Peng Jiang, Kaigui Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems, as the success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting, which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1) semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items contribute most of the positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the cold-start problem that hinders the recommender quality on cold-start items. We propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We experimentally prove that compared to the content description proposed in existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt information by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise personalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model bias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PROMO has been successfully deployed on a popular short-video sharing platform, a billion-user scale commercial short-video application, achieving remarkable performance gains across various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aizierjiang Aiersilan</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model (LLM) translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanoko Goto, Takumi Karasawa, Takumi Hirose, Rei Kawakami, Nakamasa Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Small object detection aims to localize and classify small objects within images. With recent advances in large-scale vision-language pretraining, finetuning pretrained object detection models has emerged as a promising approach. However, finetuning large models is computationally and memory expensive. To address this issue, this paper introduces multi-point positional insertion (MPI) tuning, a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method for small object detection. Specifically, MPI incorporates multiple positional embeddings into a frozen pretrained model, enabling the efficient detection of small objects by providing precise positional information to latent features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method on the SODA-D dataset. MPI performed comparably to conventional PEFT methods, including CoOp and VPT, while significantly reducing the number of parameters that need to be tuned.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Nghia Bui, Huy-Son Nguyen, Cam-Van Nguyen Thi, Hoang-Quynh Le, Duc-Trong Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to suggest a set of interconnected items to users. However, diverse interaction types and sparse interaction matrices often pose challenges for previous approaches in accurately predicting user-bundle adoptions. Inspired by the distant supervision strategy and generative paradigm, we propose BRIDGE, a novel framework for bundle recommendation. It consists of two main components namely the correlation-based item clustering and the pseudo bundle generation modules. Inspired by the distant supervision approach, the former is to generate more auxiliary information, e.g., instructive item clusters, for training without using external data. This information is subsequently aggregated with collaborative signals from user historical interactions to create pseudo `ideal' bundles. This capability allows BRIDGE to explore all aspects of bundles, rather than being limited to existing real-world bundles. It effectively bridging the gap between user imagination and predefined bundles, hence improving the bundle recommendation performance. Experimental results validate the superiority of our models over state-of-the-art ranking-based methods across five benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Yang, Chong Wang, Meihua Zhao, Zimeng Zhao, Huiling Zheng, Bin Zhang, Jianing Wang, Xiaofeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Ocean forecasting is crucial for both scientific research and societal benefits. Currently, the most accurate forecasting systems are global ocean forecasting systems (GOFSs), which represent the ocean state variables (OSVs) as discrete grids and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the transitions of oceanic state variables using numerical methods. However, GOFSs processes are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors. Recently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted forecasting speed and accuracy. Unfortunately, building a large AI ocean forecasting system that can be considered cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled forecasts remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce LangYa, a cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled ocean forecasting system. Results demonstrate that the time embedding module in LangYa enables a single model to make forecasts with lead times ranging from 1 to 7 days. The air-sea coupled module effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention module improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training, and the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline forecasting. Compared to existing numerical and AI-based ocean forecasting systems, LangYa uses 27 years of global ocean data from the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation version 12 (GLORYS12) for training and achieves more reliable deterministic forecasting results for OSVs. LangYa forecasting system provides global ocean researchers with access to a powerful software tool for accurate ocean forecasting and opens a new paradigm for ocean science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Ming Huang, Kuan-Yu Chen, Wen-Wei Lin, Da-Yi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems play crucial roles in reducing the risk of seismic disasters. Previously, the dominant modeling system was the single-station models. Such models digest signal data received at a given station and predict earth-quake parameters, such as the p-phase arrival time, intensity, and magnitude at that location. Various methods have demonstrated adequate performance. However, most of these methods present the challenges of the difficulty of speeding up the alarm time, providing early warning for distant areas, and considering global information to enhance performance. Recently, deep learning has significantly impacted many fields, including seismology. Thus, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework, called SENSE, for the intensity prediction task of earthquake early warning systems. To explicitly consider global information from a regional or national perspective, the input to SENSE comprises statistics from a set of stations in a given region or country. The SENSE model is designed to learn the relationships among the set of input stations and the locality-specific characteristics of each station. Thus, SENSE is not only expected to provide more reliable forecasts by considering multistation data but also has the ability to provide early warnings to distant areas that have not yet received signals. This study conducted extensive experiments on datasets from Taiwan and Japan. The results revealed that SENSE can deliver competitive or even better performances compared with other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific techniques and knowledge is reflected in the exponential increase in new patents filed annually. While these patents drive innovation, they also present significant burden for researchers and engineers, especially newcomers. To avoid the tedious work of navigating a vast and complex landscape to identify trends and breakthroughs, researchers urgently need efficient tools to summarize, evaluate, and contextualize patents, revealing their innovative contributions and underlying scientific principles.To address this need, we present EvoPat, a multi-LLM-based patent agent designed to assist users in analyzing patents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced search strategies. EvoPat leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), each performing specialized roles such as planning, identifying innovations, and conducting comparative evaluations. The system integrates data from local databases, including patents, literature, product catalogous, and company repositories, and online searches to provide up-to-date insights. The ability to collect information not included in original database automatically is also implemented. Through extensive testing in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, we demonstrate that EvoPat outperforms GPT-4 in tasks such as patent summarization, comparative analysis, and technical evaluation. EvoPat represents a significant step toward creating AI-powered tools that empower researchers and engineers to efficiently navigate the complexities of the patent landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Yu, Xinda Wu, Yunfei Xu, Tieyao Zhang, Songruoyao Wu, Le Ma, Kejun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Lyric-to-melody generation aims to automatically create melodies based on given lyrics, requiring the capture of complex and subtle correlations between them. However, previous works usually suffer from two main challenges: 1) lyric-melody alignment modeling, which is often simplified to one-syllable/word-to-one-note alignment, while others have the problem of low alignment accuracy; 2) lyric-melody harmony modeling, which usually relies heavily on intermediates or strict rules, limiting model's capabilities and generative diversity. In this paper, we propose SongGLM, a lyric-to-melody generation system that leverages 2D alignment encoding and multi-task pre-training based on the General Language Model (GLM) to guarantee the alignment and harmony between lyrics and melodies. Specifically, 1) we introduce a unified symbolic song representation for lyrics and melodies with word-level and phrase-level (2D) alignment encoding to capture the lyric-melody alignment; 2) we design a multi-task pre-training framework with hierarchical blank infilling objectives (n-gram, phrase, and long span), and incorporate lyric-melody relationships into the extraction of harmonized n-grams to ensure the lyric-melody harmony. We also construct a large-scale lyric-melody paired dataset comprising over 200,000 English song pieces for pre-training and fine-tuning. The objective and subjective results indicate that SongGLM can generate melodies from lyrics with significant improvements in both alignment and harmony, outperforming all the previous baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Hu, Richard L. Lewis</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive tasks originally developed for humans are now increasingly used to study language models. While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it's often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argued that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans. By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance instead reflects a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. In addition, we push the best performing model to higher n values and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the ongoing conversation around refining methodologies for the cognitive evaluation of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngmoon Jung, Jinyoung Lee, Seungjin Lee, Myunghun Jung, Yong-Hyeok Lee, Hoon-Young Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in flexible keyword spotting (KWS) with text enrollment allow users to personalize keywords without uttering them during enrollment. However, there is still room for improvement in target keyword performance. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot transfer learning method, called text-aware adapter (TA-adapter), designed to enhance a pre-trained flexible KWS model for specific keywords with limited speech samples. To adapt the acoustic encoder, we leverage a jointly pre-trained text encoder to generate a text embedding that acts as a representative vector for the keyword. By fine-tuning only a small portion of the network while keeping the core components' weights intact, the TA-adapter proves highly efficient for few-shot KWS, enabling a seamless return to the original pre-trained model. In our experiments, the TA-adapter demonstrated significant performance improvements across 35 distinct keywords from the Google Speech Commands V2 dataset, with only a 0.14% increase in the total number of parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have achieved significant advancements. Correspondingly, many automated metrics have emerged to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of generative models. However, the performance comparison among these automated metrics is limited by existing small datasets. Additionally, these datasets lack the capacity to assess the performance of automated metrics at a fine-grained level. In this study, we contribute an EvalMuse-40K benchmark, gathering 40K image-text pairs with fine-grained human annotations for image-text alignment-related tasks. In the construction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt sampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our benchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of image-text alignment metrics for T2I models. Meanwhile, we introduce two new methods to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of T2I models: FGA-BLIP2 which involves end-to-end fine-tuning of a vision-language model to produce fine-grained image-text alignment scores and PN-VQA which adopts a novel positive-negative VQA manner in VQA models for zero-shot fine-grained evaluation. Both methods achieve impressive performance in image-text alignment evaluations. We also use our methods to rank current AIGC models, in which the results can serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of T2I generation. The data and code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emerging topics in biomedical research are continuously expanding, providing a wealth of information about genes and their function. This rapid proliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of the latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast corpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a time-consuming and cumbersome task.

In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our approach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then fine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that LLM significantly enhances the integration of gene-specific information, allowing more efficient decision-making in ongoing research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements, primarily due to their capabilities in modeling the hidden relationships within text sequences. This innovation presents a unique opportunity in the field of life sciences, where vast collections of single-cell omics data from multiple species provide a foundation for training foundational models. However, the challenge lies in the disparity of data scales across different species, hindering the development of a comprehensive model for interpreting genetic data across diverse organisms. In this study, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the general knowledge capabilities of LLMs with domain-specific representation models for single-cell omics data interpretation. We begin by focusing on genes as the fundamental unit of representation. Gene representations are initialized using functional descriptions, leveraging the strengths of mature language models such as LLaMA-2. By inputting single-cell gene-level expression data with prompts, we effectively model cellular representations based on the differential expression levels of genes across various species and cell types. In the experiments, we constructed developmental cells from humans and mice, specifically targeting cells that are challenging to annotate. We evaluated our methodology through basic tasks such as cell annotation and visualization analysis. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to other methods using LLMs, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and interoperability. Our hybrid approach enhances the representation of single-cell data and offers a robust framework for future research in cross-species genetic analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: The video-to-audio (V2A) generation task has drawn attention in the field of multimedia due to the practicality in producing Foley sound. Semantic and temporal conditions are fed to the generation model to indicate sound events and temporal occurrence. Recent studies on synthesizing immersive and synchronized audio are faced with challenges on videos with moving visual presence. The temporal condition is not accurate enough while low-resolution semantic condition exacerbates the problem. To tackle these challenges, we propose Smooth-Foley, a V2A generative model taking semantic guidance from the textual label across the generation to enhance both semantic and temporal alignment in audio. Two adapters are trained to leverage pre-trained text-to-audio generation models. A frame adapter integrates high-resolution frame-wise video features while a temporal adapter integrates temporal conditions obtained from similarities of visual frames and textual labels. The incorporation of semantic guidance from textual labels achieves precise audio-video alignment. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. Results show that Smooth-Foley performs better than existing models on both continuous sound scenarios and general scenarios. With semantic guidance, the audio generated by Smooth-Foley exhibits higher quality and better adherence to physical laws.</p>

<p>Abstract: The stateful nature of large language model (LLM) servingcan easily throttle precious GPU memory under load burstor long-generation requests like chain-of-thought reasoning,causing latency spikes due to queuing incoming requests. However, state-of-the-art KVCache centric approaches handleload spikes by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache,which faces an essential tradeoff between the performance ofongoing vs. incoming requests and thus still severely violatesSLO.This paper makes a key observation such that model param-eters are independent of the requests and are replicated acrossGPUs, and thus proposes a parameter-centric approach byselectively dropping replicated parameters to leave preciousmemory for requests. However, LLM requires KVCache tobe saved in bound with model parameters and thus droppingparameters can cause either huge computation waste or longnetwork delay, affecting all ongoing requests. Based on the ob-servation that attention operators can be decoupled from otheroperators, this paper further proposes a novel remote attentionmechanism through pipeline parallelism so as to serve up-coming requests with the additional memory borrowed fromparameters on remote GPUs. This paper further addresses sev-eral other challenges including lively exchanging KVCachewith incomplete parameters, generating an appropriate planthat balances memory requirements with cooperative exe-cution overhead, and seamlessly restoring parameters whenthe throttling has gone. Evaluations show thatKUNSERVEreduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 27.3x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Luo, Qitao Qin, Hao Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Ruiran Yan, Kefan Wang, Jie Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihao Liu, Yibo Yang, Xiaojie Li, David A. Clifton, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Online continual learning (OCL) seeks to learn new tasks from data streams that appear only once, while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. Most existing methods rely on replay, focusing on enhancing memory retention through regularization or distillation. However, they often overlook the adaptability of the model, limiting the ability to learn generalizable and discriminative features incrementally from online training data. To address this, we introduce a plug-and-play module, S6MOD, which can be integrated into most existing methods and directly improve adaptability. Specifically, S6MOD introduces an extra branch after the backbone, where a mixture of discretization selectively adjusts parameters in a selective state space model, enriching selective scan patterns such that the model can adaptively select the most sensitive discretization method for current dynamics. We further design a class-conditional routing algorithm for dynamic, uncertainty-based adjustment and implement a contrastive discretization loss to optimize it. Extensive experiments combining our module with various models demonstrate that S6MOD significantly enhances model adaptability, leading to substantial performance gains and achieving the state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yucong Luo, Mingyue Cheng, Jie Ouyang, Xiaoyu Tao, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models.

<p>Abstract: This research explores the applicability of cross-lingual transfer learning from English to Japanese and Indonesian using the XLM-R pre-trained model. The results are compared with several previous works, either by models using a similar zero-shot approach or a fully-supervised approach, to provide an overview of the zero-shot transfer learning approach's capability using XLM-R in comparison with existing models. Our models achieve the best result in one Japanese dataset and comparable results in other datasets in Japanese and Indonesian languages without being trained using the target language. Furthermore, the results suggest that it is possible to train a multi-lingual model, instead of one model for each language, and achieve promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andre Rusli, Makoto Shishido</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper analyses how traditional baseline metrics, such as BLEU and TER, and neural-based methods, such as BERTScore and COMET, score several NMT models performance on chat translation and how these metrics perform when compared to human-annotated scores. The results show that for ranking NMT models in chat translations, all metrics seem consistent in deciding which model outperforms the others. This implies that traditional baseline metrics, which are faster and simpler to use, can still be helpful. On the other hand, when it comes to better correlation with human judgment, neural-based metrics outperform traditional metrics, with COMET achieving the highest correlation with the human-annotated score on a chat translation. However, we show that even the best metric struggles when scoring English translations from sentences with anaphoric zero-pronoun in Japanese.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiduo Zhang, Zhe Xu, Peiju Liu, Xiaopeng Yu, Yuan Li, Qinghui Gao, Zhaoye Fei, Zhangyue Yin, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: General-purposed embodied agents are designed to understand the users' natural instructions or intentions and act precisely to complete universal tasks. Recently, methods based on foundation models especially Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have shown a substantial potential to solve language-conditioned manipulation (LCM) tasks well. However, existing benchmarks do not adequately meet the needs of VLAs and relative algorithms. To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Du, Henghui Jiang, Xiaodong Li, Yiqing Guo, Yan Chen, Feijiang Li, Peng Zhou, Yuhua Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to integrate complementary information from multiple views to enhance clustering performance. Late Fusion Multi-View Clustering (LFMVC) has shown promise by synthesizing diverse clustering results into a unified consensus. However, current LFMVC methods struggle with noisy and redundant partitions and often fail to capture high-order correlations across views. To address these limitations, we present a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the generalization error bounds of multiple kernel $k$-means, leveraging local Rademacher complexity and principal eigenvalue proportions. Our analysis establishes a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, significantly improving upon the existing rate in the order of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k/n})$. Building on this insight, we propose a low-pass graph filtering strategy within a multiple linear $k$-means framework to mitigate noise and redundancy, further refining the principal eigenvalue proportion and enhancing clustering accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clustering performance and robustness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijin Xie, Lin Sun, Bingquan Liu, Dexin Wang, Xiangzheng Zhang, Chengjie Sun, Jiajia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Distinguishing spatial relations is a basic part of human cognition which requires fine-grained perception on cross-instance. Although benchmarks like MME, MMBench and SEED comprehensively have evaluated various capabilities which already include visual spatial reasoning(VSR). There is still a lack of sufficient quantity and quality evaluation and optimization datasets for Vision Large Language Models(VLLMs) specifically targeting visual positional reasoning. To handle this, we first diagnosed current VLLMs with the VSR dataset and proposed a unified test set. We found current VLLMs to exhibit a contradiction of over-sensitivity to language instructions and under-sensitivity to visual positional information. By expanding the original benchmark from two aspects of tunning data and model structure, we mitigated this phenomenon. To our knowledge, we expanded spatially positioned image data controllably using diffusion models for the first time and integrated original visual encoding(CLIP) with other 3 powerful visual encoders(SigLIP, SAM and DINO). After conducting combination experiments on scaling data and models, we obtained a VLLM VSR Expert(VSRE) that not only generalizes better to different instructions but also accurately distinguishes differences in visual positional information. VSRE achieved over a 27\% increase in accuracy on the VSR test set. It becomes a performant VLLM on the position reasoning of both the VSR dataset and relevant subsets of other evaluation benchmarks. We open-sourced the expanded model with data and Appendix at \url{https://github.com/peijin360/vsre} and hope it will accelerate advancements in VLLM on VSR learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rong Shan, Jianghao Lin, Chenxu Zhu, Bo Chen, Menghui Zhu, Kangning Zhang, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson disease, especially in its early stages, can be a challenging task. The application of machine learning techniques helps improve the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson disease detection but only few studies have presented work towards the prediction of disease progression. In this research work, Long Short Term Memory LSTM was trained using the diagnostic features on Parkinson patients speech signals, to predict the disease progression while a Multilayer Perceptron MLP was trained on the same diagnostic features to detect the disease. Diagnostic features selected using two well-known feature selection methods named Relief-F and Sequential Forward Selection and applied on LSTM and MLP have shown to accurately predict the disease progression as stage 2 and 3 and its existence respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lan-Zhe Guo, Lin-Han Jia, Jie-Jing Shao, Yu-Feng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to improve performance by exploiting unlabeled data when labels are scarce. Conventional SSL studies typically assume close environments where important factors (e.g., label, feature, distribution) between labeled and unlabeled data are consistent. However, more practical tasks involve open environments where important factors between labeled and unlabeled data are inconsistent. It has been reported that exploiting inconsistent unlabeled data causes severe performance degradation, even worse than the simple supervised learning baseline. Manually verifying the quality of unlabeled data is not desirable, therefore, it is important to study robust SSL with inconsistent unlabeled data in open environments. This paper briefly introduces some advances in this line of research, focusing on techniques concerning label, feature, and data distribution inconsistency in SSL, and presents the evaluation benchmarks. Open research problems are also discussed for reference purposes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hojun Choi, Junsuk Choe, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) develops methods for testing unseen categories by aligning object region embeddings with corresponding VLM features. A recent study leverages the idea that VLMs implicitly learn compositional structures of semantic concepts within the image. Instead of using an individual region embedding, it utilizes a bag of region embeddings as a new representation to incorporate compositional structures into the OVD task. However, this approach often fails to capture the contextual concepts of each region, leading to noisy compositional structures. This results in only marginal performance improvements and reduced efficiency. To address this, we propose a novel concept-based alignment method that samples a more powerful and efficient compositional structure. Our approach groups contextually related ``concepts'' into a bag and adjusts the scale of concepts within the bag for more effective embedding alignment. Combined with Faster R-CNN, our method achieves improvements of 2.6 box AP50 and 0.5 mask AP over prior work on novel categories in the open-vocabulary COCO and LVIS benchmarks. Furthermore, our method reduces CLIP computation in FLOPs by 80.3% compared to previous research, significantly enhancing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the OVD datasets.</p>

This challenge focuses on detecting machine-generated vs. human-authored essays for academic purposes. The task is defined as follows: "Given an essay, identify whether it is generated by a machine or authored by a human.'' The challenge involves two languages: English and Arabic. During the evaluation phase, 25 teams submitted systems for English and 21 teams for Arabic, reflecting substantial interest in the task. Finally, seven teams submitted system description papers. The majority of submissions utilized fine-tuned transformer-based models, with one team employing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 and Llama 3. This paper outlines the task formulation, details the dataset construction process, and explains the evaluation framework. Additionally, we present a summary of the approaches adopted by participating teams.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Xiang, Mingzhi Zhu, Dawei Cheng, Enxia Li, Ruihui Zhao, Yi Ouyang, Ling Chen, Yefeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Credit card fraud incurs a considerable cost for both cardholders and issuing banks. Contemporary methods apply machine learning-based classifiers to detect fraudulent behavior from labeled transaction records. But labeled data are usually a small proportion of billions of real transactions due to expensive labeling costs, which implies that they do not well exploit many natural features from unlabeled data. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised graph neural network for fraud detection. Specifically, we leverage transaction records to construct a temporal transaction graph, which is composed of temporal transactions (nodes) and interactions (edges) among them. Then we pass messages among the nodes through a Gated Temporal Attention Network (GTAN) to learn the transaction representation. We further model the fraud patterns through risk propagation among transactions. The extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world transaction dataset and two publicly available fraud detection datasets. The result shows that our proposed method, namely GTAN, outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on three fraud detection datasets. Semi-supervised experiments demonstrate the excellent fraud detection performance of our model with only a tiny proportion of labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Ruan, Shihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanism has been extensively integrated within mainstream neural network architectures, such as Transformers and graph attention networks. Yet, its underlying working principles remain somewhat elusive. What is its essence? Are there any connections between it and traditional machine learning algorithms? In this study, we inspect the process of computing similarity using classic metrics and vector space properties in manifold learning, clustering, and supervised learning. We identify the key characteristics of similarity computation and information propagation in these methods and demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism in deep learning adheres to the same principles but operates more flexibly and adaptively. We decompose the self-attention mechanism into a learnable pseudo-metric function and an information propagation process based on similarity computation. We prove that the self-attention mechanism converges to a drift-diffusion process through continuous modeling provided the pseudo-metric is a transformation of a metric and certain reasonable assumptions hold. This equation could be transformed into a heat equation under a new metric. In addition, we give a first-order analysis of attention mechanism with a general pseudo-metric function. This study aids in understanding the effects and principle of attention mechanism through physical intuition. Finally, we propose a modified attention mechanism called metric-attention by leveraging the concept of metric learning to facilitate the ability to learn desired metrics more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms self-attention regarding training efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Code review is a vital but demanding aspect of software development, generating significant interest in automating review comments. Traditional evaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face two major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in open-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with objectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.
  This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set. Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.
  Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively. Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Liu, Wanjing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Data corruption, including missing and noisy data, poses significant challenges in real-world machine learning. This study investigates the effects of data corruption on model performance and explores strategies to mitigate these effects through two experimental setups: supervised learning with NLP tasks (NLP-SL) and deep reinforcement learning for traffic signal optimization (Signal-RL). We analyze the relationship between data corruption levels and model performance, evaluate the effectiveness of data imputation methods, and assess the utility of enlarging datasets to address data corruption.
  Our results show that model performance under data corruption follows a diminishing return curve, modeled by the exponential function. Missing data, while detrimental, is less harmful than noisy data, which causes severe performance degradation and training instability, particularly in sequential decision-making tasks like Signal-RL. Imputation strategies involve a trade-off: they recover missing information but may introduce noise. Their effectiveness depends on imputation accuracy and corruption ratio. We identify distinct regions in the imputation advantage heatmap, including an "imputation advantageous corner" and an "imputation disadvantageous edge" and classify tasks as "noise-sensitive" or "noise-insensitive" based on their decision boundaries.
  Furthermore, we find that increasing dataset size mitigates but cannot fully overcome the effects of data corruption. The marginal utility of additional data diminishes as corruption increases. An empirical rule emerges: approximately 30% of the data is critical for determining performance, while the remaining 70% has minimal impact.
  These findings provide actionable insights into data preprocessing, imputation strategies, and data collection practices, guiding the development of robust machine learning systems in noisy environments.</p>

This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enhancing their performance has become a research hotspot. This paper presents a novel multi-prompt ensemble decoding approach designed to bolster the generation quality of LLMs by leveraging the aggregation of outcomes from multiple prompts. Given a unique input $X$, we submit $n$ variations of prompts with $X$ to LLMs in batch mode to decode and derive probability distributions. For each token prediction, we calculate the ensemble probability by averaging the $n$ probability distributions within the batch, utilizing this aggregated probability to generate the token. This technique is dubbed Inner-Batch Ensemble. To facilitate efficient batch inference, we implement a Left-Padding strategy to maintain uniform input lengths across the n prompts. Through extensive experimentation on diverse NLP tasks, including machine translation, code generation, and text simplification, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in enhancing LLM performance. The results show substantial improvements in BLEU scores, pass@$k$ rates, and LENS metrics over conventional methods.</p>

An essential part of SSGRL is graph data augmentation. Existing methods usually rely on heuristics commonly identified through trial and error and are effective only within some application domains. Also, it is not clear why one heuristic is better than another. Moreover, recent studies have argued against some techniques (e.g., dropout: that can change the properties of molecular graphs or destroy relevant signals for graph-based document classification tasks).
  In this study, we propose a novel data-driven SSGRL approach that automatically learns a suitable graph augmentation from the signal encoded in the graph (i.e., the nodes' predictive feature and topological information). We propose two complementary approaches that produce learnable feature and topological augmentations. The former learns multi-view augmentation of node features, and the latter learns a high-order view of the topology. Moreover, the augmentations are jointly learned with the representation. Our approach is general that it can be applied to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. We perform extensive experiments on node classification (using nine homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets) and graph property prediction (using another eight datasets). The results show that the proposed method matches or outperforms the SOTA SSGRL baselines and performs similarly to semi-supervised methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanjin Yao, Jiaxing Huang, Wenhao Wu, Jingyi Zhang, Yibo Wang, Shunyu Liu, Yingjie Wang, Yuxin Song, Haocheng Feng, Li Shen, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop an MLLM that understands and solves questions by learning to create each intermediate step of the reasoning involved till the final answer. To this end, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS), a new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the concept of collective learning into ``tree search'' for effective and efficient reasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage collective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search and identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four iterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning, Backpropagation, and Selection. Using CoMCTS, we construct Mulberry-260k, a multimodal dataset with a tree of rich, explicit and well-defined reasoning nodes for each question. With Mulberry-260k, we perform collective SFT to train our model, Mulberry, a series of MLLMs with o1-like step-by-step Reasoning and Reflection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods on various benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/Mulberry</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Li, Weiqi Huang, Zan Wang, Wei Liang, Huijun Di, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans naturally rely on floor plans to navigate in unfamiliar environments, as they are readily available, reliable, and provide rich geometrical guidance. However, existing visual navigation settings overlook this valuable prior knowledge, leading to limited efficiency and accuracy. To eliminate this gap, we introduce a novel navigation task: Floor Plan Visual Navigation (FloNa), the first attempt to incorporate floor plan into embodied visual navigation. While the floor plan offers significant advantages, two key challenges emerge: (1) handling the spatial inconsistency between the floor plan and the actual scene layout for collision-free navigation, and (2) aligning observed images with the floor plan sketch despite their distinct modalities. To address these challenges, we propose FloDiff, a novel diffusion policy framework incorporating a localization module to facilitate alignment between the current observation and the floor plan. We further collect $20k$ navigation episodes across $117$ scenes in the iGibson simulator to support the training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in unfamiliar scenes using floor plan knowledge. Project website: https://gauleejx.github.io/flona/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Zhang, Chenshuo Sun, Renyu Zhang, Khim-Yong Goh</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC), such as advertisement copy, product descriptions, and social media posts, is becoming ubiquitous in business practices. However, the value of AI-generated metadata, such as titles, remains unclear on user-generated content (UGC) platforms. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale field experiment on a leading short-video platform in Asia to provide about 1 million users access to AI-generated titles for their uploaded videos. Our findings show that the provision of AI-generated titles significantly boosted content consumption, increasing valid watches by 1.6% and watch duration by 0.9%. When producers adopted these titles, these increases jumped to 7.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This viewership-boost effect was largely attributed to the use of this generative AI (GAI) tool increasing the likelihood of videos having a title by 41.4%. The effect was more pronounced for groups more affected by metadata sparsity. Mechanism analysis revealed that AI-generated metadata improved user-video matching accuracy in the platform's recommender system. Interestingly, for a video for which the producer would have posted a title anyway, adopting the AI-generated title decreased its viewership on average, implying that AI-generated titles may be of lower quality than human-generated ones. However, when producers chose to co-create with GAI and significantly revised the AI-generated titles, the videos outperformed their counterparts with either fully AI-generated or human-generated titles, showcasing the benefits of human-AI co-creation. This study highlights the value of AI-generated metadata and human-AI metadata co-creation in enhancing user-content matching and content consumption for UGC platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongjian Hu, Peng Yang, Bing Li, Zhenqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yu, Xin Yang, Le Zhang, Hanlin Gu, Tianrui Li, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jangseop Park, Namwoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonlinear structural analyses in engineering often require extensive finite element simulations, limiting their applicability in design optimization, uncertainty quantification, and real-time control. Conventional deep learning surrogates, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and fourier neural operators (FNOs), face challenges with complex non-parametric three-dimensional (3D) geometries, directionally varying loads, and high-fidelity predictions on unstructured meshes. This work presents Point-DeepONet, an operator-learning-based surrogate that integrates PointNet into the DeepONet framework. By directly processing non-parametric point clouds and incorporating signed distance functions (SDF) for geometric context, Point-DeepONet accurately predicts three-dimensional displacement and von Mises stress fields without mesh parameterization or retraining. Trained using only about 5,000 nodes (2.5% of the original 200,000-node mesh), Point-DeepONet can still predict the entire mesh at high fidelity, achieving a coefficient of determination reaching 0.987 for displacement and 0.923 for von Mises stress under a horizontal load case. Compared to nonlinear finite element analyses that require about 19.32 minutes per case, Point-DeepONet provides predictions in mere seconds-approximately 400 times faster-while maintaining excellent scalability and accuracy with increasing dataset sizes. These findings highlight the potential of Point-DeepONet to enable rapid, high-fidelity structural analyses, ultimately supporting more effective design exploration and informed decision-making in complex engineering workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meixia He, Peican Zhu, Keke Tang, Yangming Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing approaches focus on hypergraph modification attacks guided by gradients, overlooking node spanning in the hypergraph and the group identity of hyperedges, thereby resulting in limited attack performance and detectable attacks. In this manuscript, we present a novel framework, i.e., Hypergraph Attacks via Injecting Homogeneous Nodes into Elite Hyperedges (IE-Attack), to tackle these challenges. Initially, utilizing the node spanning in the hypergraph, we propose the elite hyperedges sampler to identify hyperedges to be injected. Subsequently, a node generator utilizing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is proposed to generate the homogeneous node with the group identity of hyperedges. Finally, by injecting the homogeneous node into elite hyperedges, IE-Attack improves the attack performance and enhances the imperceptibility of attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on five authentic datasets to validate the effectiveness of IE-Attack and the corresponding superiority to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhyeok Choi, Heehyeon Kim, Joyce Jiyoung Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as an effective tool for fraud detection, identifying fraudulent users, and uncovering malicious behaviors. However, attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors and their risks have rarely been studied, thereby leaving potential threats unaddressed. Recent findings suggest that frauds are increasingly organized as gangs or groups. In this work, we design attack scenarios where fraud gangs aim to make their fraud nodes misclassified as benign by camouflaging their illicit activities in collusion. Based on these scenarios, we study adversarial attacks against GNN-based fraud detectors by simulating attacks of fraud gangs in three real-world fraud cases: spam reviews, fake news, and medical insurance frauds. We define these attacks as multi-target graph injection attacks and propose MonTi, a transformer-based Multi-target one-Time graph injection attack model. MonTi simultaneously generates attributes and edges of all attack nodes with a transformer encoder, capturing interdependencies between attributes and edges more effectively than most existing graph injection attack methods that generate these elements sequentially. Additionally, MonTi adaptively allocates the degree budget for each attack node to explore diverse injection structures involving target, candidate, and attack nodes, unlike existing methods that fix the degree budget across all attack nodes. Experiments show that MonTi outperforms the state-of-the-art graph injection attack methods on five real-world graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses theory in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation (EMO) and focuses on the role of crossover operators in many-objective optimisation. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present a many-objective problem class together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the widely used NSGA-III to demonstrate that crossover can yield an exponential speedup on the runtime. In particular, this algorithm can find the Pareto set in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover it requires exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimisation demonstrating an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of LLMs has deflected a growing portion of human-computer interactions towards LLM-based chatbots. The remarkable abilities of these models allow users to interact using long, diverse natural language text covering a wide range of topics and styles. Phrasing these messages is a time and effort consuming task, calling for an autocomplete solution to assist users. We introduce the task of chatbot interaction autocomplete. We present ChaI-TeA: CHat InTEraction Autocomplete; An autcomplete evaluation framework for LLM-based chatbot interactions. The framework includes a formal definition of the task, coupled with suitable datasets and metrics. We use the framework to evaluate After formally defining the task along with suitable datasets and metrics, we test 9 models on the defined auto completion task, finding that while current off-the-shelf models perform fairly, there is still much room for improvement, mainly in ranking of the generated suggestions. We provide insights for practitioners working on this task and open new research directions for researchers in the field. We release our framework to serve as a foundation for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wu Xiaoping, Hu Jie, Wei Xiaoming</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haosheng He, Jianpeng Qi, Chao Liu, Junyu Dong, Yanwei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In compute-first networking, maintaining fresh and accurate status information at the network edge is crucial for effective access to remote services. This process typically involves three phases: Status updating, user accessing, and user requesting. However, current studies on status effectiveness, such as Age of Information at Query (QAoI), do not comprehensively cover all these phases. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel metric, TPAoI, aimed at optimizing update decisions by measuring the freshness of service status. The stochastic nature of edge environments, characterized by unpredictable communication delays in updating, requesting, and user access times, poses a significant challenge when modeling. To address this, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) algorithm for optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TPAoI metric effectively minimizes AoI, ensuring timely and reliable service updates in dynamic edge environments. Results indicate that TPAoI reduces AoI by an average of 47\% compared to QAoI metrics and decreases update frequency by an average of 48\% relative to conventional AoI metrics, showing significant improvement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks.

First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in linguistic tasks but struggle with mathematical reasoning, particularly in non English languages like Hindi. This research aims to enhance the mathematical reasoning skills of smaller, resource efficient open-source LLMs in both Hindi and English. We evaluate models like OpenHathi 7B, LLaMA-2 7B, WizardMath 7B, Mistral 7B, LLeMMa 7B, MAmmoTH 7B, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 using zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) methods, and supervised fine-tuning. Our approach incorporates curriculum learning, progressively training models on increasingly difficult problems, a novel Decomposition Strategy to simplify complex arithmetic operations, and a Structured Solution Design that divides solutions into phases. Our experiments result in notable performance enhancements. WizardMath 7B exceeds Gemini's accuracy on English datasets by +6% and matches Gemini's performance on Hindi datasets. Adopting a bilingual approach that combines English and Hindi samples achieves results comparable to individual language models, demonstrating the capability to learn mathematical reasoning in both languages. This research highlights the potential for improving mathematical reasoning in open-source LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our society increasingly benefits from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Unfortunately, more and more evidence shows that AI is also used for offensive purposes. Prior works have revealed various examples of use cases in which the deployment of AI can lead to violation of security and privacy objectives. No extant work, however, has been able to draw a holistic picture of the offensive potential of AI. In this SoK paper we seek to lay the ground for a systematic analysis of the heterogeneous capabilities of offensive AI. In particular we (i) account for AI risks to both humans and systems while (ii) consolidating and distilling knowledge from academic literature, expert opinions, industrial venues, as well as laymen -- all of which being valuable sources of information on offensive AI.
  To enable alignment of such diverse sources of knowledge, we devise a common set of criteria reflecting essential technological factors related to offensive AI. With the help of such criteria, we systematically analyze: 95 research papers; 38 InfoSec briefings (from, e.g., BlackHat); the responses of a user study (N=549) entailing individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise; and the opinion of 12 experts. Our contributions not only reveal concerning ways (some of which overlooked by prior work) in which AI can be offensively used today, but also represent a foothold to address this threat in the years to come.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honggu Kang, Seohyeon Cha, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm in distributed learning while preserving the privacy of users. However, the increasing size of recent models makes it unaffordable for a few users to encompass the model. It leads the users to adopt heterogeneous models based on their diverse computing capabilities and network bandwidth. Correspondingly, FL with heterogeneous models should be addressed, given that FL typically involves training a single global model. In this paper, we propose Generative Model-Aided Federated Learning (GeFL), incorporating a generative model that aggregates global knowledge across users of heterogeneous models. Our experiments on various classification tasks demonstrate notable performance improvements of GeFL compared to baselines, as well as limitations in terms of privacy and scalability. To tackle these concerns, we introduce a novel framework, GeFL-F. It trains target networks aided by feature-generative models. We empirically demonstrate the consistent performance gains of GeFL-F, while demonstrating better privacy preservation and robustness to a large number of clients. Codes are available at [1].</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gnaneswar Villuri, Alex Doboli</p>
<p>Abstract: This report characterized the suitability of existing datasets for devising new Machine Learning models, decision making methods, and analysis algorithms to improve Collaborative Problem Solving and then enumerated requirements for future datasets to be devised. Problem solving was assumed to be performed in teams of about three, four members, which talked to each other. A dataset consists of the speech recordings of such teams. The characterization methodology was based on metrics that capture cognitive, social, and emotional activities and situations. The report presented the analysis of a large group of datasets developed for Spoken Language Understanding, a research area with some similarity to Collaborative Problem Solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Papi, Peter Polak, Ond\v{r}ej Bojar, Dominik Mach\'a\v{c}ek</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST) translates source-language speech into target-language text concurrently with the speaker's speech, ensuring low latency for better user comprehension. Despite its intended application to unbounded speech, most research has focused on human pre-segmented speech, simplifying the task and overlooking significant challenges. This narrow focus, coupled with widespread terminological inconsistencies, is limiting the applicability of research outcomes to real-world applications, ultimately hindering progress in the field. Our extensive literature review of 110 papers not only reveals these critical issues in current research but also serves as the foundation for our key contributions. We 1) define the steps and core components of a SimulST system, proposing a standardized terminology and taxonomy; 2) conduct a thorough analysis of community trends, and 3) offer concrete recommendations and future directions to bridge the gaps in existing literature, from evaluation frameworks to system architectures, for advancing the field towards more realistic and effective SimulST solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mamady Delamou, Ahmed Naeem, Huseyin Arslan, El Mehdi Amhoud</p>
<p>Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave)-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) stands out as a suitable alternative for high-resolution sensing and high-speed data transmission. To meet communication and sensing requirements, many works propose a static configuration where the wave's hyperparameters such as the number of symbols in a frame and the number of frames in a communication slot are already predefined. However, two facts oblige us to redefine the problem, (1) the environment is often dynamic and uncertain, and (2) mmWave is severely impacted by wireless environments. A striking example where this challenge is very prominent is autonomous vehicle (AV). Such a system leverages integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) using mmWave to manage data transmission and the dynamism of the environment. In this work, we consider an autonomous vehicle network where an AV utilizes its queue state information (QSI) and channel state information (CSI) in conjunction with reinforcement learning techniques to manage communication and sensing. This enables the AV to achieve two primary objectives: establishing a stable communication link with other AVs and accurately estimating the velocities of surrounding objects with high resolution. The communication performance is therefore evaluated based on the queue state, the effective data rate, and the discarded packets rate. In contrast, the effectiveness of the sensing is assessed using the velocity resolution. In addition, we exploit adaptive OFDM techniques for dynamic modulation, and we suggest a reward function that leverages the age of updates to handle the communication buffer and improve sensing. The system is validated using advantage actor-critic (A2C) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, we compare our solution with the existing design and demonstrate its superior performance by computer simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alkis Kalavasis, Anay Mehrotra, Grigoris Velegkas</p>
<p>Abstract: We study language generation in the limit, introduced by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24], building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin [Ang79]. [KM24] proposed an algorithm that generates strings from any countable language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually outputs strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices breadth, i.e., the ability to generate all strings in $K$. A key open question in [KM24] is whether this trade-off between consistency and breadth is inherrent.
  Recent works proposed different notions of consistent generation with breadth. Kalavasis, Mehrotra, and Velegkas [KVM24] introduced three definitions: generation with exact breadth, approximate breadth, and unambiguous generation. Concurrently and independently, Charikar and Pabbaraju [CP24a] proposed exhaustive generation. Both works examined when generation with these notions of breadth is possible.
  Building on [CP24a, KVM24], we fully characterize language generation for these notions and their natural combinations. For exact breadth, we provide an unconditional lower bound, removing a technical condition from [KVM24] and extending the result of [CP24a] that holds for specific collections of languages. We show that generation with exact breadth is characterized by Angluin's condition for identification. We further introduce a weaker version of Angluin's condition that tightly characterizes both approximate breadth and exhaustive generation, proving their equivalence. Additionally, we show that unambiguous generation is also characterized by Angluin's condition as a special case of a broader result. Finally, we strengthen [KVM24] by giving unconditional lower bounds for stable generators, showing that Angluin's condition characterizes the previous breadth notions for stable generators. This shows a separation between stable and unstable generation with approximate breadth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Paleka, Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, Alejandro Alvarez, Vineeth Bhat, Adam Shen, Evan Wang, Florian Tram\`er</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Meng, Michael Fulham, Lei Bi, Jinman Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Deformable image registration is a fundamental requirement for medical image analysis. Recently, transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based registration methods for their ability to capture long-range dependency via self-attention (SA). However, the high computation and memory loads of SA (growing quadratically with the spatial resolution) hinder transformers from processing subtle textural information in high-resolution image features, e.g., at the full and half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as the high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise pixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical structures. Cross-covariance Attention (XCA), as a "transposed" version of SA that operates across feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with the spatial resolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependency among high-resolution image features. However, existing XCA-based transformers merely capture coarse global long-range dependency, which are unsuitable for deformable image registration relying primarily on fine-grained local correspondence. In this study, we propose to improve existing deep learning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this end, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable medical image registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). Our MAXCA serves as a general network block that can be embedded into various registration network architectures. It can capture both global and local long-range dependency among high-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel via a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked inter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical datasets demonstrate that our MAXCA block enables state-of-the-art registration performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxu Han, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen, Zhenting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dewu Zheng, Yanlin Wang, Ensheng Shi, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  OpenMind, Shaohong Zhong, Adam Zhou, Boyuan Chen, Homin Luo, Jan Liphardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are compact representations of all public knowledge of our physical environment and animal and human behaviors. The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghong Cai, Xiaodong Cun, Xiaoyu Li, Wenze Liu, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yong Zhang, Ying Shan, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Jia, Jade Zheng, Florence Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Witt, Sebastijan Duman\v{c}i\'c, Tias Guns, Claus-Christian Carbon</p>
<p>Abstract: A major bottleneck in search-based program synthesis is the exponentially growing search space which makes learning large programs intractable. Humans mitigate this problem by leveraging the compositional nature of the real world: In structured domains, a logical specification can often be decomposed into smaller, complementary solution programs. We show that compositional segmentation can be applied in the programming by examples setting to divide the search for large programs across multiple smaller program synthesis problems. For each example, we search for a decomposition into smaller units which maximizes the reconstruction accuracy in the output under a latent task program. A structural alignment of the constituent parts in the input and output leads to pairwise correspondences used to guide the program synthesis search. In order to align the input/output structures, we make use of the Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT), a formal model of human analogical reasoning which originated in the cognitive sciences. We show that decomposition-driven program synthesis with structural alignment outperforms Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) baselines on string transformation tasks even with minimal knowledge priors. Unlike existing methods, the predictive accuracy of our agent monotonically increases for additional examples and achieves an average time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(m)$ in the number $m$ of partial programs for highly structured domains such as strings. We extend this method to the complex setting of visual reasoning in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) for which ILP methods were previously infeasible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of text to interpret and generate human-like textual content. They are becoming a vital vehicle in realizing the vision of the autonomous enterprise, with organizations today actively adopting LLMs to automate many aspects of their operations. LLMs are likely to play a prominent role in future AI-augmented business process management systems, catering functionalities across all system lifecycle stages. One such system's functionality is Situation-Aware eXplainability (SAX), which relates to generating causally sound and human-interpretable explanations. In this paper, we present the SAX4BPM framework developed to generate SAX explanations. The SAX4BPM suite consists of a set of services and a central knowledge repository. The functionality of these services is to elicit the various knowledge ingredients that underlie SAX explanations. A key innovative component among these ingredients is the causal process execution view. In this work, we integrate the framework with an LLM to leverage its power to synthesize the various input ingredients for the sake of improved SAX explanations. Since the use of LLMs for SAX is also accompanied by a certain degree of doubt related to its capacity to adequately fulfill SAX along with its tendency for hallucination and lack of inherent capacity to reason, we pursued a methodological evaluation of the perceived quality of the generated explanations. We developed a designated scale and conducted a rigorous user study. Our findings show that the input presented to the LLMs aided with the guard-railing of its performance, yielding SAX explanations having better-perceived fidelity. This improvement is moderated by the perception of trust and curiosity. More so, this improvement comes at the cost of the perceived interpretability of the explanation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The problem of using structured methods to represent knowledge is well-known in conceptual modeling and has been studied for many years. It has been proven that adopting modeling patterns represents an effective structural method. Patterns are, indeed, generalizable recurrent structures that can be exploited as solutions to design problems. They aid in understanding and improving the process of creating models. The undeniable value of using patterns in conceptual modeling was demonstrated in several experimental studies. However, discovering patterns in conceptual models is widely recognized as a highly complex task and a systematic solution to pattern identification is currently lacking. In this paper, we propose a general approach to the problem of discovering frequent structures, as they occur in conceptual modeling languages. As proof of concept, we implement our approach by focusing on two widely-used conceptual modeling languages. This implementation includes an exploratory tool that integrates a frequent subgraph mining algorithm with graph manipulation techniques. The tool processes multiple conceptual models and identifies recurrent structures based on various criteria. We validate the tool using two state-of-the-art curated datasets: one consisting of models encoded in OntoUML and the other in ArchiMate. The primary objective of our approach is to provide a support tool for language engineers. This tool can be used to identify both effective and ineffective modeling practices, enabling the refinement and evolution of conceptual modeling languages. Furthermore, it facilitates the reuse of accumulated expertise, ultimately supporting the creation of higher-quality models in a given language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Liu, Qidong Liu, Yejing Wang, Wanyu Wang, Pengyue Jia, Maolin Wang, Zitao Liu, Yi Chang, Xiangyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In various domains, Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) have become essential due to their superior capability to discern intricate user preferences. Typically, SRS utilize transformer-based architectures to forecast the subsequent item within a sequence. Nevertheless, the quadratic computational complexity inherent in these models often leads to inefficiencies, hindering the achievement of real-time recommendations. Mamba, a recent advancement, has exhibited exceptional performance in time series prediction, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. However, integrating Mamba directly into SRS poses several challenges. Its inherently unidirectional nature may constrain the model's capacity to capture the full context of user-item interactions, while its instability in state estimation can compromise its ability to detect short-term patterns within interaction sequences.
  To overcome these issues, we introduce a new framework named Selective Gated Mamba (SIGMA) for Sequential Recommendation. This framework leverages a Partially Flipped Mamba (PF-Mamba) to construct a bidirectional architecture specifically tailored to improve contextual modeling. Additionally, an input-sensitive Dense Selective Gate (DS Gate) is employed to optimize directional weights and enhance the processing of sequential information in PF-Mamba. For short sequence modeling, we have also developed a Feature Extract GRU (FE-GRU) to efficiently capture short-term dependencies. Empirical results indicate that SIGMA outperforms current models on five real-world datasets. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/ziwliu-cityu/SIMGA to ease reproducibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traffic signal control plays a crucial role in urban mobility. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize beyond their training environments to unseen scenarios with varying traffic dynamics. We present TransferLight, a novel framework designed for robust generalization across road-networks, diverse traffic conditions and intersection geometries. At its core, we propose a log-distance reward function, offering spatially-aware signal prioritization while remaining adaptable to varied lane configurations - overcoming the limitations of traditional pressure-based rewards. Our hierarchical, heterogeneous, and directed graph neural network architecture effectively captures granular traffic dynamics, enabling transferability to arbitrary intersection layouts. Using a decentralized multi-agent approach, global rewards, and novel state transition priors, we develop a single, weight-tied policy that scales zero-shot to any road network without re-training. Through domain randomization during training, we additionally enhance generalization capabilities. Experimental results validate TransferLight's superior performance in unseen scenarios, advancing practical, generalizable intelligent transportation systems to meet evolving urban traffic demands.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shugang Hao, Lingjie Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an essential step in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align them with human preferences. However, human labelers are selfish and have diverse preferences. They may strategically misreport their online feedback to influence the system's aggregation towards their own preferences. Current practice simply averages labelers' feedback per time and fails to identify the most accurate human labeler, leading to linear regret $\mathcal{O}(T)$ for $T$ time slots. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study online learning mechanisms against strategic human labelers in the LLM fine-tuning process. We formulate a new dynamic Bayesian game and dynamically adjust human labelers' weights in the preference aggregation, ensuring their truthful feedback and sublinear regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$. Simulation results demonstrate our mechanism's great advantages over the existing benchmark schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanqia Cai, Yijun Yang, Zhifeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1% on GSM8K and 32.5% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Jordi Chaffer, Justin Goldston, Bayo Okusanya, Gemach D. A. T. A. I</p>
<p>Abstract: In a world increasingly defined by machine intelligence, the future depends on how we govern the development and integration of AI into society. Recent initiatives, such as the EU AI Act, EDPB opinion, U.S. Bipartisan House Task Force and NIST AI Risk Management Report, highlight the urgent need for robust governance frameworks to address the challenges posed by advancing AI technologies. However, existing frameworks fail to adequately address the rise of AI agents or the ongoing debate between centralized and decentralized governance models. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System framework, which leverages Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and soulbound tokens, to establish a decentralized global registry for AI agents. ETHOS incorporates the concept of AI specific legal entities, enabling these systems to assume limited liability and ensuring accountability through mechanisms like insurance and compliance monitoring. Additionally, the framework emphasizes the need for a collaborative, participatory approach to AI governance, engaging diverse stakeholders through public education, transparency, and international coordination. ETHOS balances innovation with ethical accountability, providing a forward looking strategy for the responsible integration of AI agents into society. Finally, this exploration reflects the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field we define as Systems Thinking at the Intersection of AI, Web3, and Society.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Calimeri, Giovambattista Ianni, Francesco Pacenza, Simona Perri, Jessica Zangari</p>
<p>Abstract: DLV2 is an AI tool for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning which supports Answer Set Programming (ASP) - a logic-based declarative formalism, successfully used in both academic and industrial applications. Given a logic program modelling a computational problem, an execution of DLV2 produces the so-called answer sets that correspond one-to-one to the solutions to the problem at hand. The computational process of DLV2 relies on the typical Ground & Solve approach where the grounding step transforms the input program into a new, equivalent ground program, and the subsequent solving step applies propositional algorithms to search for the answer sets. Recently, emerging applications in contexts such as stream reasoning and event processing created a demand for multi-shot reasoning: here, the system is expected to be reactive while repeatedly executed over rapidly changing data. In this work, we present a new incremental reasoner obtained from the evolution of DLV2 towards iterated reasoning. Rather than restarting the computation from scratch, the system remains alive across repeated shots, and it incrementally handles the internal grounding process. At each shot, the system reuses previous computations for building and maintaining a large, more general ground program, from which a smaller yet equivalent portion is determined and used for computing answer sets. Notably, the incremental process is performed in a completely transparent fashion for the user. We describe the system, its usage, its applicability and performance in some practically relevant domains. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Deng, Yan Yu, Weiyu Ma, Zirui Wang, Wenhui Zhu, Jian Zhao, Yin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of challenging simulation environments is pivotal for advancing the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In cooperative MARL settings, the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has gained prominence as a benchmark for algorithms following centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. However, with continual advancements in SMAC, many algorithms now exhibit near-optimal performance, complicating the evaluation of their true effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, in this work, we highlight a critical issue: the default opponent policy in these environments lacks sufficient diversity, leading MARL algorithms to overfit and exploit unintended vulnerabilities rather than learning robust strategies. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMAC-HARD, a novel benchmark designed to enhance training robustness and evaluation comprehensiveness. SMAC-HARD supports customizable opponent strategies, randomization of adversarial policies, and interfaces for MARL self-play, enabling agents to generalize to varying opponent behaviors and improve model stability. Furthermore, we introduce a black-box testing framework wherein agents are trained without exposure to the edited opponent scripts but are tested against these scripts to evaluate the policy coverage and adaptability of MARL algorithms. We conduct extensive evaluations of widely used and state-of-the-art algorithms on SMAC-HARD, revealing the substantial challenges posed by edited and mixed strategy opponents. Additionally, the black-box strategy tests illustrate the difficulty of transferring learned policies to unseen adversaries. We envision SMAC-HARD as a critical step toward benchmarking the next generation of MARL algorithms, fostering progress in self-play methods for multi-agent systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gagandeep Singh, Ishan Mishra, Deepak Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of a deep learning network to distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems. Existing OOD detection methods often involve complex architectural innovations, such as ensemble models, which, while enhancing detection accuracy, significantly increase model complexity and training time. Other methods utilize surrogate samples to simulate OOD inputs, but these may not generalize well across different types of OOD data. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet novel technique to enhance OOD detection in pre-trained networks without altering its original parameters. Our approach defines probabilistic trust intervals for each network weight, determined using in-distribution data. During inference, additional weight values are sampled, and the resulting disagreements among outputs are utilized for OOD detection. We propose a metric to quantify this disagreement and validate its effectiveness with empirical evidence. Our method significantly outperforms various baseline methods across multiple OOD datasets without requiring actual or surrogate OOD samples. We evaluate our approach on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10-C (a corruption-augmented version of CIFAR-10), across various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-20, DenseNet-100). On the MNIST-FashionMNIST setup, our method achieves a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 12.46\% at 95\% True Positive Rate (TPR), compared to 27.09\% achieved by the best baseline. On adversarial and corrupted datasets such as CIFAR-10-C, our proposed method easily differentiate between clean and noisy inputs. These results demonstrate the robustness of our approach in identifying corrupted and adversarial inputs, all without requiring OOD samples during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Ahuja, Divyat Mahajan, Vasilis Syrgkanis, Ioannis Mitliagkas</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to disentangle complex sensory inputs (e.g., image, text) into simple factors of variation (e.g., shape, color) without much supervision. This ability has inspired many works that attempt to solve the following question: how do we invert the data generation process to extract those factors with minimal or no supervision? Several works in the literature on non-linear independent component analysis have established this negative result; without some knowledge of the data generation process or appropriate inductive biases, it is impossible to perform this inversion. In recent years, a lot of progress has been made on disentanglement under structural assumptions, e.g., when we have access to auxiliary information that makes the factors of variation conditionally independent. However, existing work requires a lot of auxiliary information, e.g., in supervised classification, it prescribes that the number of label classes should be at least equal to the total dimension of all factors of variation. In this work, we depart from these assumptions and ask: a) How can we get disentanglement when the auxiliary information does not provide conditional independence over the factors of variation? b) Can we reduce the amount of auxiliary information required for disentanglement? For a class of models where auxiliary information does not ensure conditional independence, we show theoretically and experimentally that disentanglement (to a large extent) is possible even when the auxiliary information dimension is much less than the dimension of the true latent representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust coordination skills enable agents to operate cohesively in shared environments, together towards a common goal and, ideally, individually without hindering each other's progress. To this end, this paper presents Coordinated QMIX (CoMIX), a novel training framework for decentralized agents that enables emergent coordination through flexible policies, allowing at the same time independent decision-making at individual level. CoMIX models selfish and collaborative behavior as incremental steps in each agent's decision process. This allows agents to dynamically adapt their behavior to different situations balancing independence and collaboration. Experiments using a variety of simulation environments demonstrate that CoMIX outperforms baselines on collaborative tasks. The results validate our incremental approach as effective technique for improving coordination in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Scassola, Sebastiano Saccani, Ginevra Carbone, Luca Bortolussi</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as effective approaches for both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when a classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose a method that, given a pre-trained unconditional score-based generative model, samples from the conditional distribution under arbitrary logical constraints, without requiring additional training. Differently from other zero-shot techniques, that rather aim at generating valid conditional samples, our method is designed for approximating the true conditional distribution. Firstly, we show how to manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our approach in approximating conditional distributions for various types of constraints and data: tabular data, images and time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nokyung Park, Daewon Chae, Jeongyong Shim, Sangpil Kim, Eun-Sol Kim, Jinkyu Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning domain-invariant visual representations is important to train a model that can generalize well to unseen target task domains. Recent works demonstrate that text descriptions contain high-level class-discriminative information and such auxiliary semantic cues can be used as effective pivot embedding for domain generalization problems. However, they use pivot embedding in a global manner (i.e., aligning an image embedding with sentence-level text embedding), which does not fully utilize the semantic cues of given text description. In this work, we advocate for the use of local alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions to get domain-invariant features. To this end, we first represent image and text inputs as graphs. We then cluster nodes within these graphs and match the graph-based image node features to the nodes of textual graphs. This matching process is conducted both globally and locally, tightly aligning visual and textual semantic sub-structures. We experiment with large-scale public datasets, such as CUB-DG and DomainBed, and our model achieves matched or better state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Liu, Huayi Tang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoge Zhang, Xiao-Lin Wang, Fenglei Fan, Yiu-Ming Cheung, Indranil Bose</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generic methodology to encode hierarchical causality structure among observed variables into a neural network in order to improve its predictive performance. The proposed methodology, called causality-informed neural network (CINN), leverages three coherent steps to systematically map the structural causal knowledge into the layer-to-layer design of neural network while strictly preserving the orientation of every causal relationship. In the first step, CINN discovers causal relationships from observational data via directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning, where causal discovery is recast as a continuous optimization problem to avoid the combinatorial nature. In the second step, the discovered hierarchical causality structure among observed variables is systematically encoded into neural network through a dedicated architecture and customized loss function. By categorizing variables in the causal DAG as root, intermediate, and leaf nodes, the hierarchical causal DAG is translated into CINN with a one-to-one correspondence between nodes in the causal DAG and units in the CINN while maintaining the relative order among these nodes. Regarding the loss function, both intermediate and leaf nodes in the DAG graph are treated as target outputs during CINN training so as to drive co-learning of causal relationships among different types of nodes. As multiple loss components emerge in CINN, we leverage the projection of conflicting gradients to mitigate gradient interference among the multiple learning tasks. Computational experiments across a broad spectrum of UCI data sets demonstrate substantial advantages of CINN in predictive performance over other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, an ablation study underscores the value of integrating structural and quantitative causal knowledge in enhancing the neural network's predictive performance incrementally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianlong Li, Zhenghua Wang, Wenhao Liu, Muling Wu, Shihan Dou, Changze Lv, Xiaohua Wang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge in jailbreaking attacks has revealed significant vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) when exposed to malicious inputs. While various defense strategies have been proposed to mitigate these threats, there has been limited research into the underlying mechanisms that make LLMs vulnerable to such attacks. In this study, we suggest that the self-safeguarding capability of LLMs is linked to specific activity patterns within their representation space. Although these patterns have little impact on the semantic content of the generated text, they play a crucial role in shaping LLM behavior under jailbreaking attacks. Our findings demonstrate that these patterns can be detected with just a few pairs of contrastive queries. Extensive experimentation shows that the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaking can be manipulated by weakening or strengthening these patterns. Further visual analysis provides additional evidence for our conclusions, providing new insights into the jailbreaking phenomenon. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the potential misuse of open-source LLMs within the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: While the operationalisation of high-level AI ethics principles into practical AI/ML systems has made progress, there is still a theory-practice gap in managing tensions between the underlying AI ethics aspects. We cover five approaches for addressing the tensions via trade-offs, ranging from rudimentary to complex. The approaches differ in the types of considered context, scope, methods for measuring contexts, and degree of justification. None of the approaches is likely to be appropriate for all organisations, systems, or applications. To address this, we propose a framework which consists of: (i) proactive identification of tensions, (ii) prioritisation and weighting of ethics aspects, (iii) justification and documentation of trade-off decisions. The proposed framework aims to facilitate the implementation of well-rounded AI/ML systems that are appropriate for potential regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) as general-purpose agents is essential for understanding their capabilities and facilitating their integration into practical applications. However, the evaluation process presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework, especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis. This not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also propels the interpretability of their performance to the forefront. Ultimately, AgentBoard serves as a step towards demystifying agent behaviors and accelerating the development of stronger LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omid Madani</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider a predictor, a learner, whose input is a stream of discrete items. The predictor's task, at every time point, is probabilistic multiclass prediction, i.e. to predict which item may occur next by outputting zero or more candidate items, each with a probability, after which the actual item is revealed and the predictor updates. To output probabilities, the predictor keeps track of the proportions of the items it has seen. The stream is unbounded (lifelong), and the predictor has finite limited space. The task is open-ended: the set of items is unknown to the predictor and their totality can also grow unbounded. Moreover, there is non-stationarity: the underlying frequencies of items may change, substantially, from time to time. For instance, new items may start appearing and a few recently frequent items may cease to occur again. The predictor, being space-bounded, need only provide probabilities for those items which, at the time of prediction, have sufficiently high frequency, i.e., the salient items. This problem is motivated in the setting of Prediction Games, a self-supervised learning regime where concepts serve as both the predictors and the predictands, and the set of concepts grows over time, resulting in non-stationarities as new concepts are generated and used. We design and study a number of predictors, sparse moving averages(SMAs), for the task. One SMA adapts the sparse exponentiated moving average and another is based on queuing a few counts, keeping dynamic per-item histories. Evaluating the predicted probabilities, under noise and non-stationarity, presents challenges, and we discuss and develop evaluation methods, one based on bounding log-loss. We show that a combination of ideas, supporting dynamic predictand-specific learning rates, offers advantages in terms of faster adaption to change (plasticity), while also supporting low variance (stability).</p>

<p>Abstract: Cloud computing services provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for data storage, processing, and collaboration. With their growing popularity, concerns about security vulnerabilities are increasing. To address this, first, we provide a formal model, called CloudLens, that expresses relations between different cloud objects such as users, datastores, security roles, representing access control policies in cloud systems. Second, as access control misconfigurations are often the primary driver for cloud attacks, we develop a planning model for detecting security vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities can lead to widespread attacks such as ransomware, sensitive data exfiltration among others. A planner generates attacks to identify such vulnerabilities in the cloud. Finally, we test our approach on 14 real Amazon AWS cloud configurations of different commercial organizations. Our system can identify a broad range of security vulnerabilities, which state-of-the-art industry tools cannot detect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haeun Jeon, Hyunglip Bae, Minsu Park, Chanyeong Kim, Woo Chang Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In decision-making problems under uncertainty, predicting unknown parameters is often considered independent of the optimization part. Decision-focused learning (DFL) is a task-oriented framework that integrates prediction and optimization by adapting the predictive model to give better decisions for the corresponding task. Here, an inevitable challenge arises when computing the gradients of the optimal decision with respect to the parameters. Existing research copes with this issue by smoothly reforming surrogate optimization or constructing surrogate loss functions that mimic task loss. However, they are applied to restricted optimization domains. In this paper, we propose Locally Convex Global Loss Network (LCGLN), a global surrogate loss model that can be implemented in a general DFL paradigm. LCGLN learns task loss via a partial input convex neural network which is guaranteed to be convex for chosen inputs while keeping the non-convex global structure for the other inputs. This enables LCGLN to admit general DFL through only a single surrogate loss without any sense for choosing appropriate parametric forms. We confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of LCGLN by evaluating our proposed model with three stochastic decision-making problems.</p>

The issue of remote sensing data islands poses challenges for fully utilizing isolated datasets to train a global model. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed collaborative learning technology, offers a potential solution to leverage isolated remote sensing data. Typically, remote sensing images from different institutions exhibit significant geographic heterogeneity, characterized by coupled class-distribution heterogeneity and object-appearance heterogeneity. However, existing FL methods lack consideration of them, leading to a decline in the performance of the global model when FL is directly applied to RSS. We propose a novel Geographic heterogeneity-aware Federated learning (GeoFed) framework to bridge data islands in RSS. Our framework consists of three modules, including the Global Insight Enhancement (GIE) module, the Essential Feature Mining (EFM) module and the Local-Global Balance (LoGo) module. Through the GIE module, class distribution heterogeneity is alleviated by introducing a prior global class distribution vector. We design an EFM module to alleviate object appearance heterogeneity by constructing essential features. Furthermore, the LoGo module enables the model to possess both global generalization capability and local adaptation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., FedFBP, FedCASID, FedInria) demonstrate that our GeoFed framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yacine Izza, Xuanxiang Huang, Antonio Morgado, Jordi Planes, Alexey Ignatiev, Joao Marques-Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: The uses of machine learning (ML) have snowballed in recent years. In many cases, ML models are highly complex, and their operation is beyond the understanding of human decision-makers. Nevertheless, some uses of ML models involve high-stakes and safety-critical applications. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to help human decision-makers in understanding the operation of such complex ML models, thus eliciting trust in their operation. Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaina Raza, Mizanur Rahman, Michael R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language processing (NLP) applications. Nevertheless, these models often inherit biases from their training data. Despite the availability of various datasets for bias detection, most are limited to one or two NLP tasks (typically classification or evaluation) and lack comprehensive evaluations across a broader range of NLP tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Evaluations Across Domains BEADs dataset, designed to support a wide array of NLP tasks, including text classification, token classification, bias quantification, and benign language generation. A key focus of this paper is the gold label dataset that is annotated by GPT4 for scalabilty and verified by experts to ensure high reliability. BEADs provides data for both fine-tuning, including classification and language generation tasks, and for evaluating LLMs. Our findings indicate that BEADs effectively identifies numerous biases when fine-tuned on this dataset. It also reduces biases when used for fine-tuning language generation task, while preserving language quality. The results also reveal some prevalent demographic biases in LLMs when BEADs is used for evaluation in demographic task. We provide the BEADs dataset for detecting biases in various domains, and this dataset is readily usable for responsible AI development and application.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Shen, Yezhen Wang, Zhouhao Yang, Xiang Li, Haonan Wang, Yang Zhang, Jonathan Scarlett, Zhanxing Zhu, Kenji Kawaguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Bi-level optimization (BO) has become a fundamental mathematical framework for addressing hierarchical machine learning problems. As deep learning models continue to grow in size, the demand for scalable bi-level optimization solutions has become increasingly critical. Traditional gradient-based bi-level optimization algorithms, due to their inherent characteristics, are ill-suited to meet the demands of large-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{F}$orward $\textbf{G}$radient $\textbf{U}$nrolling with $\textbf{F}$orward $\textbf{F}$radient, abbreviated as $(\textbf{FG})^2\textbf{U}$, which achieves an unbiased stochastic approximation of the meta gradient for bi-level optimization. $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ circumvents the memory and approximation issues associated with classical bi-level optimization approaches, and delivers significantly more accurate gradient estimates than existing large-scale bi-level optimization approaches. Additionally, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ is inherently designed to support parallel computing, enabling it to effectively leverage large-scale distributed computing systems to achieve significant computational efficiency. In practice, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ and other methods can be strategically placed at different stages of the training process to achieve a more cost-effective two-phase paradigm. Further, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ is easy to implement within popular deep learning frameworks, and can be conveniently adapted to address more challenging zeroth-order bi-level optimization scenarios. We provide a thorough convergence analysis and a comprehensive practical discussion for $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$, complemented by extensive empirical evaluations, showcasing its superior performance in diverse large-scale bi-level optimization tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Romy Williamson, Niloy J. Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups. Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry. In the absence of an analogous toolbox, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation. Namely, we estimate surface normals and first and second fundamental forms of the surface, as well as compute surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace-Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface. Our representation is fully seamless, overcoming a key limitation of similar explicit representations such as Neural Surface Maps [Morreale et al. 2021]. These operators, in turn, enable geometry processing directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and evaluate robustness to isometric shape variations. We propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates, against analytical estimates, mesh-based baselines, and neural alternatives, where available. By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe that this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing. Code will be released upon acceptance, accessible from the project webpage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihui Wu, Haichang Gao, Jianping He, Ping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad M. Nazar, Mohamed Y. Selim, Ashraf Gaffar, Shakil Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into educational contexts presents a transformative potential for enhancing learning experiences. This paper introduces CourseGPT, a generative AI tool designed to support instructors and enhance the educational experiences of undergraduate students. Built on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from Mistral AI, CourseGPT offers continuous instructor support and regular updates to course materials, enriching the learning environment. By utilizing course-specific content, such as slide decks and supplementary readings and references, CourseGPT provides precise, dynamically generated responses to student inquiries. Unlike generic AI models, CourseGPT allows instructors to manage and control the responses, thus extending the course scope without overwhelming details. The paper demonstrates the application of CourseGPT using the CPR E 431 - Basics of Information System Security course as a pilot. This course, with its large enrollments and diverse curriculum, serves as an ideal testbed for CourseGPT. The tool aims to enhance the learning experience, accelerate feedback processes, and streamline administrative tasks. The study evaluates CourseGPT's impact on student outcomes, focusing on correctness scores, context recall, and faithfulness of responses. Results indicate that the Mixtral-8x7b model, with a higher parameter count, outperforms smaller models, achieving an 88.0% correctness score and a 66.6% faithfulness score. Additionally, feedback from former students and teaching assistants on CourseGPT's accuracy, helpfulness, and overall performance was collected. The outcomes revealed that a significant majority found CourseGPT to be highly accurate and beneficial in addressing their queries, with many praising its ability to provide timely and relevant information.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates different Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) approaches for the analysis of functionally graded (FG) porous beams and compares them under a new framework. The beam material properties are assumed to vary as an arbitrary continuous function. The methods consider the output of a neural network/operator as an approximation to the displacement fields and derive the equations governing beam behavior based on the continuum formulation. The methods are implemented in the framework and formulated by three approaches: (a) the vector approach leads to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), (b) the energy approach brings about the Deep Energy Method (DEM), and (c) the data-driven approach, which results in a class of Neural Operator methods. Finally, a neural operator has been trained to predict the response of the porous beam with functionally graded material under any porosity distribution pattern and any arbitrary traction condition. The results are validated with analytical and numerical reference solutions.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685">Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongjian Zhang, Xiao Wang, Huichi Zhou, Yue Yu, Mengmei Zhang, Cheng Yang, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Syed Rifat Raiyan, Zibran Zarif Amio, Sabbir Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Guo, Ruoxiang Xu, Rongcheng Li, Zhenghao Wu, Weifeng Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In extreme scenarios such as nighttime or low-visibility environments, achieving reliable perception is critical for applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables. However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints. In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navneet Kaur, Lav Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Wireless communication has evolved significantly, with 6G offering groundbreaking capabilities, particularly for IoT. However, the integration of IoT into 6G presents new security challenges, expanding the attack surface due to vulnerabilities introduced by advanced technologies such as open RAN, terahertz (THz) communication, IRS, massive MIMO, and AI. Emerging threats like AI exploitation, virtualization risks, and evolving attacks, including data manipulation and signal interference, further complicate security efforts. As 6G standards are set to be finalized by 2030, work continues to align security measures with technological advances. However, substantial gaps remain in frameworks designed to secure integrated IoT and 6G systems. Our research addresses these challenges by utilizing tree-based machine learning algorithms to manage complex datasets and evaluate feature importance. We apply data balancing techniques to ensure fair attack representation and use SHAP and LIME to improve model transparency. By aligning feature importance with XAI methods and cross-validating for consistency, we boost model accuracy and enhance IoT security within the 6G ecosystem.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Somnath Banerjee, Sayan Layek, Hari Shrawgi, Rajarshi Mandal, Avik Halder, Shanu Kumar, Sagnik Basu, Parag Agrawal, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in global applications, the importance of cultural sensitivity becomes paramount, ensuring that users from diverse backgrounds feel respected and understood. Cultural harm can arise when these models fail to align with specific cultural norms, resulting in misrepresentations or violations of cultural values. This work addresses the challenges of ensuring cultural sensitivity in LLMs, especially in small-parameter models that often lack the extensive training data needed to capture global cultural nuances. We present two key contributions: (1) A cultural harm test dataset, created to assess model outputs across different cultural contexts through scenarios that expose potential cultural insensitivities, and (2) A culturally aligned preference dataset, aimed at restoring cultural sensitivity through fine-tuning based on feedback from diverse annotators. These datasets facilitate the evaluation and enhancement of LLMs, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment across different cultural landscapes. Our results show that integrating culturally aligned feedback leads to a marked improvement in model behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of generating culturally insensitive or harmful content. Ultimately, this work paves the way for more inclusive and respectful AI systems, fostering a future where LLMs can safely and ethically navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongmei Wang, Junlin Hou, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model performance. Comprehensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in concept detection and disease diagnosis tasks while providing diverse explanations to ensure model interpretability effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijian Luo, Colin Zhang, Debing Zhang, Zhengyang Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct* (DI*), an image data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to train a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step text-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024 with only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference time and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly in PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1 on Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models. Besides the strong quantitative performances, extensive qualitative comparisons also confirm the advantages of DI* in terms of maintaining diversity, improving image layouts, and enhancing aesthetic colors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihang Qiu, Chaojie Li, Zhongyang Wang, Renyou Xie, Borui Zhang, Huadong Mo, Guo Chen, Zhaoyang Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction helps to achieve supply-demand balance in energy systems, supporting decision-making and scheduling. Traditional models, lacking AI-assisted automation, rely on experts, incur high costs, and struggle with sparse data prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Energy Forecasting Large Language Model (EF-LLM), which integrates domain knowledge and temporal data for time-series forecasting, supporting both pre-forecast operations and post-forecast decision-support. EF-LLM's human-AI interaction capabilities lower the entry barrier in forecasting tasks, reducing the need for extra expert involvement. To achieve this, we propose a continual learning approach with updatable LoRA and a multi-channel architecture for aligning heterogeneous multimodal data, enabling EF-LLM to continually learn heterogeneous multimodal knowledge. In addition, EF-LLM enables accurate predictions under sparse data conditions through its ability to process multimodal data. We propose Fusion Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (F-PEFT) method to effectively leverage both time-series data and text for this purpose. EF-LLM is also the first energy-specific LLM to detect hallucinations and quantify their occurrence rate, achieved via multi-task learning, semantic similarity analysis, and ANOVA. We have achieved success in energy prediction scenarios for load, photovoltaic, and wind power forecast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kezheng Xiong, Haoen Xiang, Qingshan Xu, Chenglu Wen, Siqi Shen, Jonathan Li, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration, a fundamental task in 3D vision, has achieved remarkable success with learning-based methods in outdoor environments. Unsupervised outdoor point cloud registration methods have recently emerged to circumvent the need for costly pose annotations. However, they fail to establish reliable optimization objectives for unsupervised training, either relying on overly strong geometric assumptions, or suffering from poor-quality pseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and high-level contextual information. We have observed that in the feature space, latent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive anchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER to incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label mining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module to dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training and discover reliable pseudo-labels by considering both high-level feature representations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with anchors for a robust feature space. Lastly, we introduce a Mixed-Density Student to learn density-invariant features, addressing challenges related to density variation and low overlap in the outdoor scenario. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our INTEGER achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Liu, Mingyang Chen, Yin Hua, Zhuo Chen, Ziqi Liu, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen, Wen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Beyond-triple fact representations including hyper-relational facts with auxiliary key-value pairs, temporal facts with additional timestamps, and nested facts implying relationships between facts, are gaining significant attention. However, existing link prediction models are usually designed for one specific type of facts, making it difficult to generalize to other fact representations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Hierarchical Representation learning framework (UniHR) for unified knowledge graph link prediction. It consists of a unified Hierarchical Data Representation (HiDR) module and a unified Hierarchical Structure Learning (HiSL) module as graph encoder. The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested factual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates intra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing the semantic information within individual facts and enriching the structural information between facts. Experimental results across 7 datasets from 3 types of KGs demonstrate that our UniHR outperforms baselines designed for one specific kind of KG, indicating strong generalization capability of HiDR form and the effectiveness of HiSL module.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Zhang, Haofeng Huang, Pengle Zhang, Jia Wei, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrixes $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrixes $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK$. Third, we propose to use an FP32 Matmul buffer for $PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 5x on RTX4090, respectively. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for large language processing, image generation, and video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Amit Agarwal, Bhargava Kumar, Karan Gupta, Priyaranjan Pattnayak</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate barcode detection and decoding in Identity documents is crucial for applications like security, healthcare, and education, where reliable data extraction and verification are essential. However, building robust detection models is challenging due to the lack of diverse, realistic datasets an issue often tied to privacy concerns and the wide variety of document formats. Traditional tools like Faker rely on predefined templates, making them less effective for capturing the complexity of real-world identity documents. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to synthetic data generation that uses LLMs to create contextually rich and realistic data without relying on predefined field. Using the vast knowledge LLMs have about different documents and content, our method creates data that reflects the variety found in real identity documents. This data is then encoded into barcode and overlayed on templates for documents such as Driver's licenses, Insurance cards, Student IDs. Our approach simplifies the process of dataset creation, eliminating the need for extensive domain knowledge or predefined fields. Compared to traditional methods like Faker, data generated by LLM demonstrates greater diversity and contextual relevance, leading to improved performance in barcode detection models. This scalable, privacy-first solution is a big step forward in advancing machine learning for automated document processing and identity verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent work of Kleinberg & Mullainathan [KM24] provides a concrete model for language generation in the limit: given a sequence of examples from an unknown target language, the goal is to generate new examples from the target language such that no incorrect examples are generated beyond some point. In sharp contrast to strong negative results for the closely related problem of language identification, they establish positive results for language generation in the limit for all countable collections of languages. Follow-up work by Raman & Tewari [RT24] studies bounds on the number of distinct inputs required by an algorithm before correct language generation is achieved -- namely, whether this is a constant for all languages in the collection (uniform generation) or a language-dependent constant (non-uniform generation).
  We show that every countable language collection has a generator which has the stronger property of non-uniform generation in the limit. However, while the generation algorithm of [KM24] can be implemented using membership queries, we show that any algorithm cannot non-uniformly generate even for collections of just two languages, using only membership queries.
  We also formalize the tension between validity and breadth in the generation algorithm of [KM24] by introducing a definition of exhaustive generation, and show a strong negative result for exhaustive generation. Our result shows that a tradeoff between validity and breadth is inherent for generation in the limit. We also provide a precise characterization of the language collections for which exhaustive generation is possible. Finally, inspired by algorithms that can choose to obtain feedback, we consider a model of uniform generation with feedback, completely characterizing language collections for which such uniform generation with feedback is possible in terms of a complexity measure of the collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaifan Zhang, Lihuo He, Xin Jiang, Wen Lu, Di Wang, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have attracted significant attention from researchers due to their non-invasive nature and high temporal sensitivity in decoding visual stimuli. However, most recent studies have focused solely on the relationship between EEG and image data pairs, neglecting the valuable ``beyond-image-modality" information embedded in EEG signals. This results in the loss of critical multimodal information in EEG. To address this limitation, we propose CognitionCapturer, a unified framework that fully leverages multimodal data to represent EEG signals. Specifically, CognitionCapturer trains Modality Expert Encoders for each modality to extract cross-modal information from the EEG modality. Then, it introduces a diffusion prior to map the EEG embedding space to the CLIP embedding space, followed by using a pretrained generative model, the proposed framework can reconstruct visual stimuli with high semantic and structural fidelity. Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CognitionCapturer outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<p>Abstract: Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens motivates linguistically-informed interventions in existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokenization pretraining can be a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the trajectory of vehicles is critically important for ensuring safety and reliability in autonomous driving. Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youshen Zhao, Keiji Iramina</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are critical for detecting abnormal brain activity, but their high dimensionality and complexity pose significant challenges for effective analysis. In this paper, we propose CwA-T, a novel framework that combines a channelwise CNN-based autoencoder with a single-head transformer classifier for efficient EEG abnormality detection. The channelwise autoencoder compresses raw EEG signals while preserving channel independence, reducing computational costs and retaining biologically meaningful features. The compressed representations are then fed into the transformer-based classifier, which efficiently models long-term dependencies to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals. Evaluated on the TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus, the proposed model achieves 85.0% accuracy, 76.2% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity at the per-case level, outperforming baseline models such as EEGNet, Deep4Conv, and FusionCNN. Furthermore, CwA-T requires only 202M FLOPs and 2.9M parameters, making it significantly more efficient than transformer-based alternatives. The framework retains interpretability through its channelwise design, demonstrating great potential for future applications in neuroscience research and clinical practice.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Zhao, Jiapeng Zhu, Can Xu, Xiang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has raised significant concerns regarding online content toxicity. When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxic knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge. Extensive experiments and in-depth case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox significantly decreases the false positive rate while boosting overall toxicity detection performance. Our code will be available soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) synergizes the retrieval of pertinent data with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring that the generated output is not only contextually relevant but also accurate and current. We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjun Liu, Weilai Jiang, Yaonan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework has gained widespread adoption due to its strong performance. However, the further development of CTDE faces two key challenges. First, agents struggle to autonomously assess the relevance of input information for cooperative tasks, impairing their decision-making abilities. Second, in communication-limited scenarios with partial observability, agents are unable to access global information, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively from a global perspective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel cooperative MARL framework based on information selection and tacit learning. In this framework, agents gradually develop implicit coordination during training, enabling them to infer the cooperative behavior of others in a discrete space without communication, relying solely on local information. Moreover, we integrate gating and selection mechanisms, allowing agents to adaptively filter information based on environmental changes, thereby enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Experiments on popular MARL benchmarks show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to significant performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunbowen Lee, Hongqin Lyu, Yicheng Gong, Yingying Sun, Chao Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods have proposed promising traffic signal control policy that can be trained on large road networks. Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation.
  In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoyan Pan, Yikang Liu, Lin Zhao, Eric Z. Chen, Xiao Chen, Terrence Chen, Shanhui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate segmentation of guidewires in interventional cardiac fluoroscopy videos is crucial for computer-aided navigation tasks. Although deep learning methods have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in wire segmentation, they require substantial annotated datasets for generalizability, underscoring the need for extensive labeled data to enhance model performance. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation-guided Frame-consistency Video Diffusion Model (SF-VD) to generate large collections of labeled fluoroscopy videos, augmenting the training data for wire segmentation networks. SF-VD leverages videos with limited annotations by independently modeling scene distribution and motion distribution. It first samples the scene distribution by generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a specified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively generating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a frame-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the process by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in the synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the superior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in guidewire segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Xu, Ali Boyaci, Jianming Lian, Aaron Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedreza Mohseni, Seyedali Mohammadi, Deepa Tilwani, Yash Saxena, Gerald Ndawula, Sriram Vema, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur</p>
<p>Abstract: Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Liu, Tahseen Rabbani, Tony O'Halloran, Ananth Sankaralingam, Mary-Anne Hartley, Brian Gravelle, Furong Huang, Cornelia Ferm\"uller, Yiannis Aloimonos</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Xiong, Nan Yin, Yifan Sun, Haoyang Li, Yingxu Wang, Duo Ai, Fang Pan, Shiyang Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Inferencing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is a pivotal challenge in systems biology, and several innovative computational methods have been introduced. However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN). Our XATGRN employs a cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture intricate gene interactions from gene expression profiles. Additionally, it uses a Dual Complex Graph Embedding approach to manage the skewed degree distribution, thereby ensuring precise prediction of regulatory relationships and their directionality. Our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets, underscoring its efficacy in elucidating complex gene regulatory mechanisms. Our codes used in this paper are publicly available at: https://github.com/kikixiong/XATGRN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxuan Zhang, Zhengxue Cheng, Yan Zhao, Shihao Wang, Dajiang Zhou, Guo Lu, Li Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, L3TC offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a 50x reduction in model parameters. More importantly, L3TC is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahe Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks on image classification systems have always been an important problem in the field of machine learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs), as popular models in the field of image generation, have been widely used in various novel scenarios due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, with the popularity of generative adversarial networks, the misuse of fake image technology has raised a series of security problems, such as malicious tampering with other people's photos and videos, and invasion of personal privacy. Inspired by the generative adversarial networks, this work proposes a novel adversarial attack method, aiming to gain insight into the weaknesses of the image classification system and improve its anti-attack ability. Specifically, the generative adversarial networks are used to generate adversarial samples with small perturbations but enough to affect the decision-making of the classifier, and the adversarial samples are generated through the adversarial learning of the training generator and the classifier. From extensive experiment analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of the method on a classical image classification dataset, and the results show that our model successfully deceives a variety of advanced classifiers while maintaining the naturalness of adversarial samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiqi Yang, Hang Li, Yucheng Chu, Yuping Lin, Tai-Quan Peng, Hui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to generate responses on social topics due to their world knowledge and generative capabilities. Beyond reasoning and generation performance, political bias is an essential issue that warrants attention. Political bias, as a universal phenomenon in human society, may be transferred to LLMs and distort LLMs' behaviors of information acquisition and dissemination with humans, leading to unequal access among different groups of people. To prevent LLMs from reproducing and reinforcing political biases, and to encourage fairer LLM-human interactions, comprehensively examining political bias in popular LLMs becomes urgent and crucial.
  In this study, we systematically measure the political biases in a wide range of LLMs, using a curated set of questions addressing political bias in various contexts. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in how LLMs respond to political topics. For highly polarized topics, most LLMs exhibit a pronounced left-leaning bias. Conversely, less polarized topics elicit greater consensus, with similar response patterns across different LLMs. Additionally, we analyze how LLM characteristics, including release date, model scale, and region of origin affect political bias. The results indicate political biases evolve with model scale and release date, and are also influenced by regional factors of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changjian Chen, Fei Lv, Yalong Guan, Pengcheng Wang, Shengjie Yu, Yifan Zhang, Zhuo Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications (e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective way to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process is uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and some of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image generation method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a multi-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the exploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the exploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better performance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice users, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier. With this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which samples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal projection method, improved model performance in the case study for both classification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirong Chen, Elizabeth Chason, Noah Mladenovski, Erin Wilson, Kristin Mullen, Stephen Martini, Meiyi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2) context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3) validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and refines the system performance.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17038">ErasableMask: A Robust and Erasable Privacy Protection Scheme against Black-box Face Recognition Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sipeng Shen, Yunming Zhang, Dengpan Ye, Xiuwen Shi, Long Tang, Haoran Duan, Jiacheng Deng, Ziyi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While face recognition (FR) models have brought remarkable convenience in face verification and identification, they also pose substantial privacy risks to the public. Existing facial privacy protection schemes usually adopt adversarial examples to disrupt face verification of FR models. However, these schemes often suffer from weak transferability against black-box FR models and permanently damage the identifiable information that cannot fulfill the requirements of authorized operations such as forensics and authentication. To address these limitations, we propose ErasableMask, a robust and erasable privacy protection scheme against black-box FR models. Specifically, via rethinking the inherent relationship between surrogate FR models, ErasableMask introduces a novel meta-auxiliary attack, which boosts black-box transferability by learning more general features in a stable and balancing optimization strategy. It also offers a perturbation erasion mechanism that supports the erasion of semantic perturbations in protected face without degrading image quality. To further improve performance, ErasableMask employs a curriculum learning strategy to mitigate optimization conflicts between adversarial attack and perturbation erasion. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that ErasableMask achieves the state-of-the-art performance in transferability, achieving over 72% confidence on average in commercial FR systems. Moreover, ErasableMask also exhibits outstanding perturbation erasion performance, achieving over 90% erasion success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjin Kim, Jaejun Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: While pruning methods effectively maintain model performance without extra training costs, they often focus solely on preserving crucial connections, overlooking the impact of pruned weights on subsequent fine-tuning or distillation, leading to inefficiencies. Moreover, most compression techniques for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3 and DDPM demonstrate that SVS improves compression performance across model types without additional training costs.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17504">An Evaluation Framework for Product Images Background Inpainting based on Human Feedback and Product Consistency</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Liang, Jun Luo, Xiaoxi Guo, Jianqi Bi</p>
<p>Abstract: In product advertising applications, the automated inpainting of backgrounds utilizing AI techniques in product images has emerged as a significant task. However, the techniques still suffer from issues such as inappropriate background and inconsistent product in generated product images, and existing approaches for evaluating the quality of generated product images are mostly inconsistent with human feedback causing the evaluation for this task to depend on manual annotation. To relieve the issues above, this paper proposes Human Feedback and Product Consistency (HFPC), which can automatically assess the generated product images based on two modules. Firstly, to solve inappropriate backgrounds, human feedback on 44,000 automated inpainting product images is collected to train a reward model based on multi-modal features extracted from BLIP and comparative learning. Secondly, to filter generated product images containing inconsistent products, a fine-tuned segmentation model is employed to segment the product of the original and generated product images and then compare the differences between the above two. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that HFPC can effectively evaluate the quality of generated product images and significantly reduce the expense of manual annotation. Moreover, HFPC achieves state-of-the-art(96.4% in precision) in comparison to other open-source visual-quality-assessment models.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629">Graph Neural Networks Are Evolutionary Algorithms</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaichen Ouyang, Shengwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic duality between graph neural networks (GNNs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), bridging two traditionally distinct fields. Building on this insight, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel evolutionary algorithm that models individuals as nodes in a graph and leverages designed frequency-domain filters to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Through the use of these filters, GNE aggregates high-frequency (diversity-enhancing) and low-frequency (stability-promoting) information, transforming EAs into interpretable and tunable mechanisms in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark functions demonstrate that GNE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as GA, DE, CMA-ES, SDAES, and RL-SHADE, excelling in complex landscapes, optimal solution shifts, and noisy environments. Its robustness, adaptability, and superior convergence highlight its practical and theoretical value. Beyond optimization, GNE establishes a conceptual and mathematical foundation linking EAs and GNNs, offering new perspectives for both fields. Its framework encourages the development of task-adaptive filters and hybrid approaches for EAs, while its insights can inspire advances in GNNs, such as improved global information propagation and mitigation of oversmoothing. GNE's versatility extends to solving challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as well as real-world applications in engineering and operations research. By uniting the dynamics of EAs with the structural insights of GNNs, this work provides a foundation for interdisciplinary innovation, paving the way for scalable and interpretable solutions to complex optimization problems.</p>
