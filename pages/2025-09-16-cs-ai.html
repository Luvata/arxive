<p><b>Authors:</b> V. Benes, M. Svitek, A. Michalikova, M. Melicherik</p>
<p>Abstract: Air pollution in cities and the possibilities of reducing this pollution represents one of the most important factors that today's society has to deal with. This paper focuses on a systemic approach to traffic emissions with their relation to meteorological conditions, analyzing the effect of weather on the quantity and dispersion of traffic emissions in a city. Using fuzzy inference systems (FIS) the model for prediction of changes in emissions depending on various conditions is developed. The proposed model is based on traffic, meteorology and emission data measured in Prague, Czech Republic. The main objective of the work is to provide insight into how urban planners and policymakers can plan and manage urban transport more effectively with environmental protection in mind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam H. Le, Patrick Erickson, Yanbo Zhang, Michael Levin, Josh Bongard</p>
<p>Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingchen Wan, Han Zhou, Ruoxi Sun, Hootan Nakhost, Ke Jiang, Rajarishi Sinha, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajjad Abdoli, Rudi Cilibrasi, Rima Al-Shikh</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation, though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse architectural perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arlen Kumar, Leanid Palkhouski</p>
<p>Abstract: AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited, and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least 0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects, threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and reproducibility considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tara Bogavelli, Roshnee Sharma, Hari Subramani</p>
<p>Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10818">LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Kovalerchuk, Brent D. Fegley</p>
<p>Abstract: Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains. The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models (LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps: (1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3) generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyin Lu, Hegang Chen, Yanghui Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs), typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875">Is the `Agent&#x27; Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Gardner, Vladimir A. Baulin</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g., LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems, currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the agent metaphor.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10931">Harmful Prompt Laundering: Jailbreaking LLMs with Abductive Styles and Symbolic Encoding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongho Joo, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongho Joo, Hyukhun Koh, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning. However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy protection.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10972">Enhancing Computational Cognitive Architectures with LLMs: A Case Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ron Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Li, Manasi Ganti, Zixian Ma, Helena Vasconcelos, Qijia He, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales -- free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes. Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and reliable evaluation practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Cui, Hang Fu, Haibin Zhang, Licheng Wang, Cong Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process, causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning performance.
  To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD} introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce \textsc{Agentic Lybic}, a novel multi-agent system where the entire architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations, Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark, \textsc{Agentic Lybic} achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07\% success rate in 50 steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zan-Kai Chong, Hiroyuki Ohsaki, Bryan Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic, multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively. The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems, our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunghwei Lai, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising solution across various domains, particularly in medical field, to mitigate data collection challenges. However, existing studies mainly utilize LLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in data privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the ability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a realistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real medical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step generation architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and conversational performance. Our framework enables the generation of contextually diverse patient records while maintaining strict medical coherence, supported by adaptive dialogue strategies and real-time clinical plausibility verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. After training with our generated virtual patients, existing models show significant improvements on the MedQA dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwei Su, Yinghui Xia, Qizhen Lan, Xinyuan Song, Yang Jingsong, Lewei He, Tianyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11131">Neural cellular automata: applications to biology and beyond classical AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Hartl, Michael Levin, L\'eo Pio-Lopez</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular, tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xiao, Chang You, Zhiyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach, the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion. Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We utilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive learning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process. Through extensive experiments, AlignKT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results on two of these datasets and exhibits competitive performance on the third. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/SCNU203/AlignKT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has rapidly emerged with the capability to generate different forms of content, including text, images, videos, and other modalities, which can achieve a quality similar to content created by humans. As a result, AIGC is now widely applied across various domains such as digital marketing, education, and public health, and has shown promising results by enhancing content creation efficiency and improving information delivery. However, there are few studies that explore the latest progress and emerging challenges of AIGC across different domains. To bridge this gap, this paper brings together 16 scholars from multiple disciplines to provide a cross-domain perspective on the trends and challenges of AIGC. Specifically, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) It first provides a broader overview of AIGC, spanning the training techniques of Generative AI, detection methods, and both the spread and use of AI-generated content across digital platforms. (2) It then introduces the societal impacts of AIGC across diverse domains, along with a review of existing methods employed in these contexts. (3) Finally, it discusses the key technical challenges and presents research propositions to guide future work. Through these contributions, this vision paper seeks to offer readers a cross-domain perspective on AIGC, providing insights into its current research trends, ongoing challenges, and future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Liang, Bangxin Li, Zixuan Chen, Hanyue Zheng, Zhi Ma, Di Wang, Cong Tian, Quan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging task for effective knowledge dissemination. However, existing works on document automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel multi-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a conversational interface. VideoAgent parses a source paper into a fine-grained asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human evaluation to measure knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific communication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingchen Wang, Zi-Yu Khoo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudeshna Jana, Manjira Sinha, Tirthankar Dasgupta</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of plastics and their persistence in the environment have led to the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics across air, water, and soil, posing serious health risks including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological disorders. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models to extract relational metapaths, multi-hop semantic chains linking pollutant sources to health impacts, from scientific abstracts. Our system identifies and connects entities across diverse contexts to construct structured relational metapaths, which are aggregated into a Toxicity Trajectory Graph that traces pollutant propagation through exposure routes and biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic conflicts arising from evolving or contradictory research findings. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution for mining complex cause-effect structures in domain-specific corpora.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11336">The power of dynamic causality in observer-based design for soft sensor applications</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> William Farlessyost, Sebastian Oberst, Shweta Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks, continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often rely on a single optimization trajectory, limiting adaptability and efficiency while suffering from narrow perspectives, gradient conflicts, and high computational cost. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent), a framework integrating multi-agent collaboration with gradient-based optimization. MAPGD features specialized agents for task clarity, example selection, format design, and stylistic refinement; semantic gradient coordination to resolve conflicts; bandit-based candidate selection for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees. Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency. Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and conflict resolution, providing a unified, gradient-inspired multi-agent approach to robust and interpretable prompt optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11431">Securing AI Agents: Implementing Role-Based Access Control for Industrial Applications</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aadil Gani Ganie</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced solutions across various domains, from political science to software development. However, these models are constrained by their training data, which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date. Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning -- whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data, enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements, AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Jiang, Kofi Osei, Sai Deepthi Yeddula, Dongji Feng, Wei-Shinn Ku</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery, and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models. Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022. The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Taherin, Juyi Lin, Arash Akbari, Arman Akbari, Pu Zhao, Weiwei Chen, David Kaeli, Yanzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11507">MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jared Zhu, Junde Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms, navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated improves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from 28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Bui, An Nguyen, Phat Thai, Minh Hua, Ngan Pham L. N., Ngan Pham T. B., Dung Le, Long Nguyen, Thanh-Tung Tran, Thang Bui, Tho Quan</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to contextualize its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching Chang, Yidan Shi, Defu Cao, Wei Yang, Jeehyun Hwang, Haixin Wang, Jiacheng Pang, Wei Wang, Yan Liu, Wen-Chih Peng, Tien-Fu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\% laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering, integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage (Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset, indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal, network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736515), to advance reproducible and regulation-conscious AML experimentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Celemin, Joseph Brennan, Pierluigi Vito Amadori, Tim Bradley</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead. We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal, and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Yao, Naitong Yu, Xiang Li, Xin Jiang, Xuezhi Fang, Wenjia Ma, Xuying Meng, Jing Li, Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users' facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and (iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilei Dai, Ruotian Chen, Songze Guan, Wen-Tai Li, Chau Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy management. However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL across various control problems in building energy management. To address this gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for optimization control for common problems in the building energy management field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems. With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel van Gerven</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilia Kopanichuk, Petr Anokhin, Vladimir Shaposhnikov, Vladimir Makharev, Ekaterina Tsapieva, Iaroslav Bespalov, Dmitry V. Dylov, Ivan Oseledets</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result. Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models (LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonin Sulc, Thorsten Hellert</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susanta Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus J. Buehler</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that coherent, long-form musical composition can emerge from a decentralized swarm of identical, frozen foundation models that coordinate via stigmergic, peer-to-peer signals, without any weight updates. We compare a centralized multi-agent system with a global critic to a fully decentralized swarm in which bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus. Across symbolic, audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while delivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity metrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary roles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with efficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying how local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and dynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to long-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music to collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emmanuel Adjei Domfeh, Christopher L. Dancy</p>
<p>Abstract: In high-stakes disaster scenarios, timely and informed decision-making is critical yet often challenged by uncertainty, dynamic environments, and limited resources. This paper presents a systematic review of Human-AI collaboration patterns that support decision-making across all disaster management phases. Drawing from 51 peer-reviewed studies, we identify four major categories: Human-AI Decision Support Systems, Task and Resource Coordination, Trust and Transparency, and Simulation and Training. Within these, we analyze sub-patterns such as cognitive-augmented intelligence, multi-agent coordination, explainable AI, and virtual training environments. Our review highlights how AI systems may enhance situational awareness, improves response efficiency, and support complex decision-making, while also surfacing critical limitations in scalability, interpretability, and system interoperability. We conclude by outlining key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need for adaptive, trustworthy, and context-aware Human-AI systems to improve disaster resilience and equitable recovery outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Cai, Shujuan Liu, Jian Zhao, Ziyan Shi, Yusheng Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, Tianle Zhang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12091">Bridging Engineering and AI Planning through Model-Based Knowledge Transformation for the Validation of Automated Production System Variants</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamied Nabizada, Lasse Beers, Alain Chahine, Felix Gehlhoff, Oliver Niggemann, Alexander Fay</p>
<p>Abstract: Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior. However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions, effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual transformations or external capability models, the method supports native integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into legal practice raises pressing concerns about judicial fairness, particularly due to the nature of their "black-box" processes. This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive, open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks. JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65 extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4) informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments, enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods. Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools. JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution. In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness). The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.</p>

<p>Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025), we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models (LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation, modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases, outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached 98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text, physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision. They can be used not only for conventional digital image material to recognize patterns, but also for feature extraction from digital imagery representing spectral and rhythm features extracted from time-domain digital audio signals for the acoustic classification of sounds. Different spectral and rhythm feature representations like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams are investigated in terms of the audio classification performance using a deep convolutional neural network. It can be clearly shown that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better than the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs. The experiments were carried out with the aid of the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Wang, Tianyu Li, Ruishi Li, Umang Mathur, Prateek Saxena</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly, skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program test suites.</p>

<p>Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Jingshu Peng, Yanyan Shen, Xujia Li, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which use price series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance. Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems, traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengzheng Yang, Yanfei Ren, David Osei Opoku, Ruochang Li, Peng Ren, Chunxiao Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images, and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering, validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Liu, Yaokun Liu, Zelin Li, Zhenrui Yue, Gyuseok Lee, Ruichen Yao, Yang Zhang, Dong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative recommenders adopt a two-stage paradigm: items are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization, where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii) discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings. DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation performance. Our code will be made available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Ponnock, Grace Kenneally, Michael Robert Briggs, Elinor Yeo, Tyrone Patterson III, Nicholas Kinberg, Matthew Kalinowski, David Hechtman</p>
<p>Abstract: New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis, fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing sophistication of technology systems makes traditional threat modeling hard to scale, especially for small organizations with limited resources. This paper develops and evaluates AegisShield, a generative AI enhanced threat modeling tool that implements STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK to automate threat generation and provide systematic assessments. By integrating real time threat intelligence from the National Vulnerability Database and AlienVault Open Threat Exchange, AegisShield produces streamlined and accessible threat descriptions. Our assessment of 243 threats from 15 case studies and over 8000 AI generated threats shows that AegisShield reduces complexity (p less than 0.001), yields outputs semantically aligned with expert developed threats (p less than 0.05), and achieves an 85.4 percent success rate in mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (p less than 0.001). Automating and standardizing threat modeling helps under resourced organizations address risk earlier and supports wider adoption of secure by design practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengcheng Luo, Yunyang Zhao, Bowen Zhang, Genke Yang, Boon-Hee Soong, Chau Yuen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of 5G, the internet has entered a new video-centric era. From short-video platforms like TikTok to long-video platforms like Bilibili, online video services are reshaping user consumption habits. Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) control is widely recognized as a critical factor influencing Quality of Experience (QoE). Recent learning-based ABR methods have attracted increasing attention. However, most of them rely on limited network trace sets during training and overlook the wide-distribution characteristics of real-world network conditions, resulting in poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SABR, a training framework that combines behavior cloning (BC) pretraining with reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. We also introduce benchmarks, ABRBench-3G and ABRBench-4G+, which provide wide-coverage training traces and dedicated OOD test sets for assessing robustness to unseen network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SABR achieves the best average rank compared with Pensieve, Comyco, and NetLLM across the proposed benchmarks. These results indicate that SABR enables more stable learning across wide distributions and improves generalization to unseen network conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuwen Cao, Guijun Liu, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Howard H. Yang, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
<p>Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting, and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an inherent robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Wang, Jing Ren, Tongyu Song, Wenjun Li, Xiong Wang, Sheng Wang, Shizhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of large-scale LoRaWAN networks requires jointly optimizing conflicting metrics like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Energy Efficiency (EE) by dynamically allocating transmission parameters, including Carrier Frequency, Spreading Factor, and Transmission Power. Existing methods often oversimplify this challenge, focusing on a single metric or lacking the adaptability needed for dynamic channel environments, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that intelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa, is a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing specialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces learning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network dynamics. To further enhance performance in LoRaWAN networks, we introduce CD-LoRa, a hybrid framework that integrates a lightweight, centralized initialization phase to perform a one-time, quasi-optimal channel assignment and action space pruning, thereby accelerating subsequent distributed learning. Extensive simulations and real-world field experiments demonstrate the superiority of our frameworks, showing that D-LoRa excels in non-stationary environments while CD-LoRa achieves the fastest convergence in stationary conditions. In physical deployments, our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, improving PDR by up to 10.8% and EE by 26.1%, confirming their practical effectiveness for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc-Thinh Ngo (STACK, LS2N), Kandaraj Piamrat, Ons Aouedi, Thomas Hassan, Philippe Raipin-Parv\'edy</p>
<p>Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures enable flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient mobile networks by disaggregating and virtualizing baseband functions. However, this flexibility introduces significant challenges for resource management, requiring joint optimization of functional split selection and virtualized unit placement under dynamic demands and complex topologies. Existing solutions often address these aspects separately or lack scalability in large and real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel Graph-Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO) framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for topology-aware feature extraction and integrates action masking to efficiently navigate the combinatorial decision space. Our approach jointly optimizes functional split and placement decisions, capturing the full complexity of O-RAN resource allocation. Extensive experiments on both small-and large-scale O-RAN scenarios demonstrate that GPPO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 18% lower deployment cost and 25% higher reward in generalization tests, while maintaining perfect reliability. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of GPPO for practical O-RAN deployments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this, we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions, Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\% reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Yuan, Jingtao Li, Weiming Zhuang, Chen Chen, Lingjuan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing. Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the computational resources compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mianchu Wang, Giovanni Montana</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving 100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by 4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data - representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vadim Allayev, Mahbubur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Internet of Intelligent Things (IoIT), an emerging field, combines the utility of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the innovation of embedded AI algorithms. However, it does not come without challenges, and struggles regarding available computing resources, energy supply, and storage limitations. In particular, many impediments to IoIT are linked to the energy-efficient deployment of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models in embedded devices. Research has been conducted to design energy-efficient IoIT platforms, but these papers often focus on centralized systems, in which some central entity processes all the data and coordinates actions. This can be problematic, e.g., serve as bottleneck or lead to security concerns. In a decentralized system, nodes/devices would self-organize and make their own decisions. Therefore, to address such issues, we propose a heterogeneous, decentralized sensing and monitoring IoIT peer-to-peer mesh network system model. Nodes in the network will coordinate towards several optimization goals: reliability, energy efficiency, and latency. The system employs federated learning to train nodes in a distributed manner, metaheuristics to optimize task allocation and routing paths, and multi-objective optimization to balance conflicting performance goals.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNets) play a key role by stacking different communication technologies such as sub-6GHz, mm-wave and DSRC to meet diverse connectivity needs of 5G/B5G vehicular networks. HetVNet helps address the humongous user demands-but maintaining a steady connection in a highly mobile, real-world conditions remain a challenge. Though there has been ample of studies on beam prediction models a dedicated solution for HetVNets is sparsely explored. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a reliable beam prediction solution, specifically for HetVNets. This paper introduces a lightweight deep learning-based solution termed-"CAR-BRAINet" which consists of convolutional neural networks with a powerful multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. Existing literature on beam prediction is largely studied under a limited, idealised vehicular scenario, often overlooking the real-time complexities and intricacies of vehicular networks. Therefore, this study aims to mimic the complexities of a real-time driving scenario by incorporating key factors such as prominent MAC protocols-3GPP-C-V2X and IEEE 802.11BD, the effect of Doppler shifts under high velocity and varying distance and SNR levels into three high-quality dynamic datasets pertaining to urban, rural and highway vehicular networks. CAR-BRAINet performs effectively across all the vehicular scenarios, demonstrating precise beam prediction with minimal beam overhead and a steady improvement of 17.9422% on the spectral efficiency over the existing methods. Thus, this study justifies the effectiveness of CAR-BRAINet in complex HetVNets, offering promising performance without relying on the location angle and antenna dimensions of the mobile users, and thereby reducing the redundant sensor-latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Teja Reddy Adapala</p>
<p>Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse, a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism. Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect. We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier, where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure, suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by 3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes, LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450. The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98 for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode (constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends, action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL, LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in modern educational platforms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments, conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for real-world healthcare applications.</p>

This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions. By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of its kind to support intelligent command generation and provides practical value for workload assessment, staffing, and scheduling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kush Gupta, Amir Aly, Emmanuel Ifeachor, Rohit Shankar</p>
<p>Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD. These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence, highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mujie Liu, Mengchu Zhu, Qichao Dong, Ting Dang, Jiangang Ma, Jing Ren, Feng Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Psychiatric disorders involve complex neural activity changes, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data serving as key diagnostic evidence. However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dieter Balemans, Thomas Huybrechts, Jan Steckel, Siegfried Mercelis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions. These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques, showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple weight magnitude considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aoi Otani</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with "catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14% higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly, random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Li, Jiexiong Liu, Yixuan Chen, Jie ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure (DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization, achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy. Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Himanshu Choudhary, Arishi Orra, Manoj Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anand Gopalakrishnan, Robert Csord\'as, J\"urgen Schmidhuber, Michael C. Mozer</p>
<p>Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where. We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity) and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or the use of position-interpolation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaoge Li, Yang Chen, Zhijie Rao, Can Jiang, Jingcai Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models, especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications, edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at https://github.com/keepgoingjkg/SG-LoRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahil Tyagi</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rumeng Li, Xun Wang, Hong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment: (1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support low-resource clinical text analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) assistants are increasingly integrated into enterprise workflows, raising new security concerns as they bridge internal and external data sources. This paper presents an in-depth case study of EchoLeak (CVE-2025-32711), a zero-click prompt injection vulnerability in Microsoft 365 Copilot that enabled remote, unauthenticated data exfiltration via a single crafted email. By chaining multiple bypasses-evading Microsofts XPIA (Cross Prompt Injection Attempt) classifier, circumventing link redaction with reference-style Markdown, exploiting auto-fetched images, and abusing a Microsoft Teams proxy allowed by the content security policy-EchoLeak achieved full privilege escalation across LLM trust boundaries without user interaction. We analyze why existing defenses failed, and outline a set of engineering mitigations including prompt partitioning, enhanced input/output filtering, provenance-based access control, and strict content security policies. Beyond the specific exploit, we derive generalizable lessons for building secure AI copilots, emphasizing the principle of least privilege, defense-in-depth architectures, and continuous adversarial testing. Our findings establish prompt injection as a practical, high-severity vulnerability class in production AI systems and provide a blueprint for defending against future AI-native threats.</p>

On a benchmark dataset, our method lifts adversarial accuracy from 50-55% to over 93% while maintaining clean-sample performance. Frames 3-4 offer strong predictive signals, showing early-stage classification is possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Mohammadhosseini, Jacob Chakareski, Nicholas Mastronarde</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose ASL360, an adaptive deep reinforcement learning-based scheduler for on-demand 360{\deg} video streaming to mobile VR users in next generation wireless networks. We aim to maximize the overall Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users served over a UAV-assisted 5G wireless network. Our system model comprises a macro base station (MBS) and a UAV-mounted base station which both deploy mm-Wave transmission to the users. The 360{\deg} video is encoded into dependent layers and segmented tiles, allowing a user to schedule downloads of each layer's segments. Furthermore, each user utilizes multiple buffers to store the corresponding video layer's segments. We model the scheduling decision as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent selects Base or Enhancement layers to maximize the QoE and use a policy gradient-based method (PPO) to find the optimal policy. Additionally, we implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism for cost components, allowing the system to adaptively balance and prioritize the video quality, buffer occupancy, and quality change based on real-time network and streaming session conditions. We demonstrate that ASL360 significantly improves the QoE, achieving approximately 2 dB higher average video quality, 80% lower average rebuffering time, and 57% lower video quality variation, relative to competitive baseline methods. Our results show the effectiveness of our layered and adaptive approach in enhancing the QoE in immersive videostreaming applications, particularly in dynamic and challenging network environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches. We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1. These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and domain-aware LLM alignment.</p>

Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases.

AVEC introduces an adaptive budgeting algorithm that allocates per-query differential privacy parameters based on sensitivity, local confidence, and historical usage, and uses verifiable transformation with on-device integrity checks. We formalize guarantees using R\'enyi differential privacy with odometer-based accounting, and establish utility ceilings, delegation-leakage bounds, and impossibility results for deterministic gating and hash-only certification. Our evaluation is simulation-based by design to study mechanism behavior and accounting; we do not claim deployment readiness or task-level utility with live LLMs. The contribution is a conceptual architecture and theoretical foundation that chart a pathway for empirical follow-up on privately bootstrapping local LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable data quality is crucial for downstream analysis of tabular datasets, yet rule-based validation often struggles with inefficiency, human intervention, and high computational costs. We present a three-stage framework that combines statistical inliner detection with LLM-driven rule and code generation. After filtering data samples through traditional clustering, we iteratively prompt LLMs to produce semantically valid quality rules and synthesize their executable validators through code-generating LLMs. To generate reliable quality rules, we aid LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by leveraging external knowledge sources and domain-specific few-shot examples. Robust guardrails ensure the accuracy and consistency of both rules and code snippets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhizheng Wang, Yifan Yang, Qiao Jin, Zhiyong Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508 in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs, exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyuan Zhang, Suzhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the aesthetic experience and educational value of collaborative artmaking with generative artificial intelligence (AI) among young learners and art students. Based on a survey of 112 participants, we examine how human creators renegotiate their roles, how conventional notions of originality are challenged, how the creative process is transformed, and how aesthetic judgment is formed in human--AI co-creation. Empirically, participants generally view AI as a partner that stimulates ideation and expands creative boundaries rather than a passive tool, while simultaneously voicing concerns about stylistic homogenization and the erosion of traditional authorship. Theoretically, we synthesize Dewey's aesthetics of experience, Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor--network theory (ANT) into a single analytical framework to unpack the dynamics between human creators and AI as a non-human actant. Findings indicate (i) a fluid subjectivity in which creators shift across multiple stances (director, dialogic partner, discoverer); (ii) an iterative, dialogic workflow (intent--generate--select--refine) that centers critical interpretation; and (iii) an educational value shift from technical skill training toward higher-order competencies such as critical judgment, cross-modal ideation, and reflexivity. We argue that arts education should cultivate a \emph{critical co-creation} stance toward technology, guiding learners to collaborate with AI while preserving human distinctiveness in concept formation, judgment, and meaning-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danilo Francati, Yevin Nikhel Goonatilake, Shubham Pawar, Daniele Venturi, Giuseppe Ateniese</p>
<p>Abstract: We prove a sharp threshold for the robustness of cryptographic watermarking for generative models. This is achieved by introducing a coding abstraction, which we call messageless secret-key codes, that formalizes sufficient and necessary requirements of robust watermarking: soundness, tamper detection, and pseudorandomness. Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For binary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are modified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is $(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.
  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet the bound up to a constant slack. For every ${\delta} > 0$, assuming pseudorandom functions and access to a public counter, we build linear-time codes that tolerate up to $(1/2)(1-{\delta})$ errors in the binary case and $(1-1/q)(1-{\delta})$ errors in the $q$-ary case. Together with the lower bound, these yield the maximum robustness achievable under standard cryptographic assumptions.
  We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact.
  These results provide a complete characterization of robust watermarking, identifying the threshold at which robustness fails, constructions that achieve it, and an experimental confirmation that the threshold is already reached in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Namrata Srivastava, Shruti Jain, Clayton Cohn, Naveeduddin Mohammed, Umesh Timalsina, Gautam Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploratory learning environments (ELEs), such as simulation-based platforms and open-ended science curricula, promote hands-on exploration and problem-solving but make it difficult for teachers to gain timely insights into students' conceptual understanding. This paper presents LearnLens, a generative AI (GenAI)-enhanced teacher-facing dashboard designed to support problem-based instruction in middle school science. LearnLens processes students' open-ended responses from digital assessments to provide various insights, including sample responses, word clouds, bar charts, and AI-generated summaries. These features elucidate students' thinking, enabling teachers to adjust their instruction based on emerging patterns of understanding. The dashboard was informed by teacher input during professional development sessions and implemented within a middle school Earth science curriculum. We report insights from teacher interviews that highlight the dashboard's usability and potential to guide teachers' instruction in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofan Zhou, Zisu Wang, Janice Krieger, Mohan Zalake, Lu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge. Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to accurately assess eligibility criteria.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Betty Mayeku, Sandra Hummel, Parisa Memarmoshrefi</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained popularity in various domains due to its ability to address several issues in Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those related to privacy, security, bias mitigation, and adaptability. With these abilities, MU is evolving into a promising technology in upholding Responsible AI principles and optimizing ML models' performance. However, despite its promising potential, the concept has not received much attention in the education sector. In an attempt to encourage further uptake of this promising technology in the educational landscape, this paper demonstrates that MU indeed has great potential to serve as a practical mechanism for operationalizing Responsible AI principles as well as an essential tool for Adaptive AI within the educational application domain hence fostering trust in AI-driven educational systems. Through a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed sources, we identify four domains where MU holds particular promise namely privacy protection, resilience against adversarial inputs, mitigation of systemic bias, and adaptability in evolving learning contexts. We systematically explore these potentials and their interventions to core challenges in ML-based education systems. As a conceptual contribution, we present a reference Machine Unlearning application architecture for Responsible and Adaptive AI (MU-RAAI) in education context.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the effectiveness and reliability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading system for a handwritten general chemistry exam, comparing AI-assigned scores to human grading across various types of questions. Exam pages and grading rubrics were uploaded as images to account for chemical reaction equations, short and long open-ended answers, numerical and symbolic answer derivations, drawing, and sketching in pencil-and-paper format. Using linear regression analyses and psychometric evaluations, the investigation reveals high agreement between AI and human graders for textual and chemical reaction questions, while highlighting lower reliability for numerical and graphical tasks. The findings emphasize the necessity for human oversight to ensure grading accuracy, based on selective filtering. The results indicate promising applications for AI in routine assessment tasks, though careful consideration must be given to student perceptions of fairness and trust in integrating AI-based grading into educational practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sven Jacobs, Natalie Kiesler</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time voice interfaces using multimodal Generative AI (GenAI) can potentially address the accessibility needs of novice programmers with disabilities (e.g., related to vision). Yet, little is known about how novices interact with GenAI tools and their feedback quality in the form of audio output. This paper analyzes audio dialogues from nine 9th-grade students using a voice-enabled tutor (powered by OpenAI's Realtime API) in an authentic classroom setting while learning Python. We examined the students' voice prompts and AI's responses (1210 messages) by using qualitative coding. We also gathered students' perceptions via the Partner Modeling Questionnaire. The GenAI Voice Tutor primarily offered feedback on mistakes and next steps, but its correctness was limited (71.4% correct out of 416 feedback outputs). Quality issues were observed, particularly when the AI attempted to utter programming code elements. Students used the GenAI voice tutor primarily for debugging. They perceived it as competent, only somewhat human-like, and flexible. The present study is the first to explore the interaction dynamics of real-time voice GenAI tutors and novice programmers, informing future educational tool design and potentially addressing accessibility needs of diverse learners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan A. Karr Jr, Ben Darden, Nicholas Pell, Ryan M. Fryer, Kayla Ambrose, Evan Hall, Ramzi K. Bualuan, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: The National Running Club Database (NRCD) aggregates 15,397 race results of 5,585 athletes from the 2023 and 2024 cross country seasons. This paper introduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete progressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that runners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing 8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those who race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions, including weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the NRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency between genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset accessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where smaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from the internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers a unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance competition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a valuable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw data and applied sports science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Vicente Moreno Cencerrado, Arnau Padr\'es Masdemont, Anton Gonzalvez Hawthorne, David Demitri Africa, Lorenzo Pacchiardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly? To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets, outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM internals.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified \emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices. In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Rajaneesh, Thomas Zollo, Richard Zemel</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping UX design practices through "vibe coding," where UX professionals express intent in natural language and AI translates it into functional prototypes and code. Despite rapid adoption, little research has examined how vibe coding reconfigures UX workflows and collaboration. Drawing on interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, AI generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports creativity, and lowers barriers to participation. However, professionals reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance. We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping ("intending the right design") and reflection ("designing the right intention"), introducing new asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through the lens of responsible human-AI collaboration for AI-assisted UX design and development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI-driven digital ecosystems span diverse stakeholders including technology firms, regulators, accelerators and civil society, yet often lack cohesive ethical governance. This paper proposes a four-pillar framework (SCOR) to embed accountability, fairness, and inclusivity across such multi-actor networks. Leveraging a design science approach, we develop a Shared Ethical Charter(S), structured Co-Design and Stakeholder Engagement protocols(C), a system of Continuous Oversight and Learning(O), and Adaptive Regulatory Alignment strategies(R). Each component includes practical guidance, from lite modules for resource-constrained start-ups to in-depth auditing systems for larger consortia. Through illustrative vignettes in healthcare, finance, and smart city contexts, we demonstrate how the framework can harmonize organizational culture, leadership incentives, and cross-jurisdictional compliance. Our mixed-method KPI design further ensures that quantitative targets are complemented by qualitative assessments of user trust and cultural change. By uniting ethical principles with scalable operational structures, this paper offers a replicable pathway toward responsible AI innovation in complex digital ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chirayu Nimonkar, Shlok Shah, Catherine Ji, Benjamin Eysenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative approaches never witness a single successful trial.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felicia Liu, Jay J. Yoo, Farzad Khalvati</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks, specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors. Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined (e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance, robustness, and utility in the medical space.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach, EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other high-stakes domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Jalil Piran, Zhiling Chen, Yang Zhang, Qianyu Zhou, Jiong Tang, Farhad Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized federated learning faces privacy risks because model updates can leak data through inference attacks and membership inference, a concern that grows over many client exchanges. Differential privacy offers principled protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds, which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds only the difference between the required noise and what has already been accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal, and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP). PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions, PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80% with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iman Nodozi, Djordje Gligorijevic, Abhishek Halder</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type, device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A numerical example illustrates the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoming Jing, Oren Wright, Jos\'e M. F. Moura, Yorie Nakahira</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning, sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution shifts and limited memory resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: The dark patterns, deceptive interface designs manipulating user behaviors, have been extensively studied for their effects on human decision-making and autonomy. Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes: humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and oversight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ozan Gokdemir, Neil Getty, Robert Underwood, Sandeep Madireddy, Franck Cappello, Arvind Ramanathan, Ian T. Foster, Rick L. Stevens</p>
<p>Abstract: As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from 22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions, comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1. We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Vu, Brian K. Tran, Syed A. Shah, Geigh Zollicoffer, Nhat Hoang-Xuan, Manish Bhattarai</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics. Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Zhou, Ruyi Ding, Gaowen Liu, Charles Fleming, Ramana Rao Kompella, Yunsi Fei, Xiaolin Xu, Shaolei Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of digital and AI-generated images has amplified the need for secure and verifiable methods of image attribution. While digital watermarking offers more robust protection than metadata-based approaches--which can be easily stripped--current watermarking techniques remain vulnerable to forgery, creating risks of misattribution that can damage the reputations of AI model developers and the rights of digital artists. These vulnerabilities arise from two key issues: (1) content-agnostic watermarks, which, once learned or leaked, can be transferred across images to fake attribution, and (2) reliance on detector-based verification, which is unreliable since detectors can be tricked. We present MetaSeal, a novel framework for content-dependent watermarking with cryptographic security guarantees to safeguard image attribution. Our design provides (1) forgery resistance, preventing unauthorized replication and enforcing cryptographic verification; (2) robust, self-contained protection, embedding attribution directly into images while maintaining resilience against benign transformations; and (3) evidence of tampering, making malicious alterations visually detectable. Experiments demonstrate that MetaSeal effectively mitigates forgery attempts and applies to both natural and AI-generated images, establishing a new standard for secure image attribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ariana Tang, Naveen Raman, Fei Fang, Zheyuan Ryan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities, leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiwei Xiao, Qing Xiao, Xinying Hou, Hanqi Jane Li, Phenyo Phemelo Moletsane, Hong Shen, John Stamper</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering K-12 classrooms, offering teachers new ways for teaching practices. Yet GenAI models are often trained on culturally uneven datasets, embedding a "default culture" that often misaligns with local classrooms. To understand how teachers navigate this gap, we defined the new concept Cultural Distance (the gap between GenAI's default cultural repertoire and the situated demands of teaching practice) and conducted in-depth interviews with 30 K-12 teachers, 10 each from South Africa, Taiwan, and the United States, who had integrated AI into their teaching practice. These teachers' experiences informed the development of our three-level cultural distance framework. This work contributes the concept and framework of cultural distance, six illustrative instances spanning in low, mid, high distance levels with teachers' experiences and strategies for addressing them. Empirically, we offer implications to help AI designers, policymakers, and educators create more equitable and culturally responsive GenAI tools for education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luke Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision, and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in real-world LLM applications.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10798">Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV Cache Eviction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Liu, Yixuan Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Shiyu Ji, Yang Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Narimani, Alireza Pourreza, Ali Moghimi, Parastoo Farajpoor, Hamid Jafarbiglu, Mohsen Mesgaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.</p>

Current debiasing methods based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget. Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe improvement pathways. Across diverse datasets and design conditions, our approach improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification, reduces decision-making risks, and offers a tuning foundation that delivers interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under budget constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 -- across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong generalization to unknown intent detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohui Rao, Hanlin Wu, Zhenguang G. Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources. Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine engagement in human-AI social interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyeop Kim, Yohan Lee, Sanghwa Kim, Hyunjong Kim, Sungzoon Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions, capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/sangyeop-kim/PREMem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of understanding and generating human-like text, offering transformative potential across diverse domains. The Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for safeguarding digital infrastructure, represents one of these domains. SOCs serve as the frontline of defense in cybersecurity, tasked with continuous monitoring, detection, and response to incidents. However, SOCs face persistent challenges such as high alert volumes, limited resources, high demand for experts with advanced knowledge, delayed response times, and difficulties in leveraging threat intelligence effectively. In this context, LLMs can offer promising solutions by automating log analysis, streamlining triage, improving detection accuracy, and providing the required knowledge in less time. This survey systematically explores the integration of generative AI and more specifically LLMs into SOC workflow, providing a structured perspective on its capabilities, challenges, and future directions. We believe that this survey offers researchers and SOC managers a broad overview of the current state of LLM integration within academic study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to examine LLM applications in SOCs in details.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical role.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alma C. Castaneda-Leautaud, Rommie E. Amaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening campaigns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Pei Zhang, Shuang Luo, Jialong Tang, Yu Wan, Baosong Yang, Fei Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs) in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs' cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies, domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1) a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360 entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of 14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence, models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is available at https://github.com/Eyr3/CultureSynth.}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Lu, Shaoyi Zheng, Yuxuan Xia, Shengjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mitali Raj</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm, carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent. A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Morabito, Guanghan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software generation in embedded machine learning workflows, yet their outputs often fail silently or behave unpredictably. This article presents an empirical investigation of failure modes in LLM-powered ML pipelines, based on an autopilot framework that orchestrates data preprocessing, model conversion, and on-device inference code generation. We show how prompt format, model behavior, and structural assumptions influence both success rates and failure characteristics, often in ways that standard validation pipelines fail to detect. Our analysis reveals a diverse set of error-prone behaviors, including format-induced misinterpretations and runtime-disruptive code that compiles but breaks downstream. We derive a taxonomy of failure categories and analyze errors across multiple LLMs, highlighting common root causes and systemic fragilities. Though grounded in specific devices, our study reveals broader challenges in LLM-based code generation. We conclude by discussing directions for improving reliability and traceability in LLM-powered embedded ML systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Aftabi, Philip Samaha, Jin Ma, Long Cheng, Ramy Harik, Dan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations. Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework, ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data, collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex instrumentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aranyak Acharyya, Carey E. Priebe, Hayden S. Helm</p>
<p>Abstract: Given an input query, generative models such as large language models produce a random response drawn from a response distribution. Given two input queries, it is natural to ask if their response distributions are the same. While traditional statistical hypothesis testing is designed to address this question, the response distribution induced by an input query is often sensitive to semantically irrelevant perturbations to the query, so much so that a traditional test of equality might indicate that two semantically equivalent queries induce statistically different response distributions. As a result, the outcome of the statistical test may not align with the user's requirements. In this paper, we address this misalignment by incorporating into the testing procedure consideration of a collection of semantically similar queries. In our setting, the mapping from the collection of user-defined semantically similar queries to the corresponding collection of response distributions is not known a priori and must be estimated, with a fixed budget. Although the problem we address is quite general, we focus our analysis on the setting where the responses are binary, show that the proposed test is asymptotically valid and consistent, and discuss important practical considerations with respect to power and computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Au Yeung, Jacopo Dalmasso, Luca Foschini, Richard JB Dobson, Zeljko Kraljevic</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions) and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37 $\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered. Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions (p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77). Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhoomit Vasani, Jack FitzGerald, Anjie Fang, Sushmit Vaish</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings. Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely, and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged. Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Vegesna, Samip Dahal</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better. Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space (the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting and localizing leaks in water distribution network systems is an important topic with direct environmental, economic, and social impact. Our paper is the first to explore the use of factor graph optimization techniques for leak localization in water distribution networks, enabling us to perform sensor fusion between pressure and demand sensor readings and to estimate the network's temporal and structural state evolution across all network nodes. The methodology introduces specific water network factors and proposes a new architecture composed of two factor graphs: a leak-free state estimation factor graph and a leak localization factor graph. When a new sensor reading is obtained, unlike Kalman and other interpolation-based methods, which estimate only the current network state, factor graphs update both current and past states. Results on Modena, L-TOWN and synthetic networks show that factor graphs are much faster than nonlinear Kalman-based alternatives such as the UKF, while also providing improvements in localization compared to state-of-the-art estimation-localization approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omid Gheibi, Christian K\"astner, Pooyan Jamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Performance-influence models are beneficial for understanding how configurations affect system performance, but their creation is challenging due to the exponential growth of configuration spaces. While gray-box approaches leverage selective "structural knowledge" (like the module execution graph of the system) to improve modeling, the relationship between this knowledge, a system's characteristics (we call them "structural aspects"), and potential model improvements is not well understood. This paper addresses this gap by formally investigating how variations in structural aspects (e.g., the number of modules and options per module) and the level of structural knowledge impact the creation of "opportunities" for improved "modular performance modeling". We introduce and quantify the concept of modeling "hardness", defined as the inherent difficulty of performance modeling. Through controlled experiments with synthetic system models, we establish an "analytical matrix" to measure these concepts. Our findings show that modeling hardness is primarily driven by the number of modules and configuration options per module. More importantly, we demonstrate that both higher levels of structural knowledge and increased modeling hardness significantly enhance the opportunity for improvement. The impact of these factors varies by performance metric; for ranking accuracy (e.g., in debugging task), structural knowledge is more dominant, while for prediction accuracy (e.g., in resource management task), hardness plays a stronger role. These results provide actionable insights for system designers, guiding them to strategically allocate time and select appropriate modeling approaches based on a system's characteristics and a given task's objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefeng Liu, Songhao Jiang, Qinan Huang, Tinson Xu, Ian Foster, Mengdi Wang, Hening Lin, Jinbo Xu, Rick Stevens</p>
<p>Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengke Sun, Shuzhen Han, Ziqian Luan, Xinghao Qin, Jiao Yin, Zhanshan Zhao, Jinli Cao, Hua Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns, high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is utilized to better model the relations between the available training data. Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) have been widely applied to various applications, including E-commerce, finance, healthcare, social media and have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment. Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work, we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds, whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Dong, Yuyang Yin, Yuqi Li, Eric Li, Hao-Xiang Guo, Yikai Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valentin Hofmann, David Heineman, Ian Magnusson, Kyle Lo, Jesse Dodge, Maarten Sap, Pang Wei Koh, Chun Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Noah A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation, neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation -- and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them (e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items). Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance. Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Baqer Mollah, Honggang Wang, Hua Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Beamforming techniques are utilized in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication to address the inherent path loss limitation, thereby establishing and maintaining reliable connections. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduces the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS coordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset. From the experiment, we observe that the proposed framework achieves up to 77.58% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, outperforms single modalities, incurs roughly as low as 2.32 dB average power loss, and considerably reduces the beam searching space overheads by 76.56% for top-15 beams with respect to standard defined approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedant Sawal, Hiu Yung Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to correct inference errors caused by stuck-at faults in fully analog ReRAM-based neuromorphic circuits. Using a Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) simulation framework, we model and analyze six spatial defect types-circular, circular-complement, ring, row, column, and checkerboard-across multiple layers of a multi-array neuromorphic architecture. We demonstrate that the proposed correction method, which employs a lightweight neural network trained on the circuit's output voltages, can recover up to 35% (from 55% to 90%) inference accuracy loss in defective scenarios. Our results, based on handwritten digit recognition tasks, show that even small corrective networks can significantly improve circuit robustness. This method offers a scalable and energy-efficient path toward enhanced yield and reliability for neuromorphic systems in edge and internet-of-things (IoTs) applications. In addition to correcting the specific defect types used during training, our method also demonstrates the ability to generalize-achieving reasonable accuracy when tested on different types of defects not seen during training. The framework can be readily extended to support real-time adaptive learning, enabling on-chip correction for dynamic or aging-induced fault profiles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyanshu Priya, Saurav Dudhate, Desai Vishesh Yasheshbhai, Asif Ekbal</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques. Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG) task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset, generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task. Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a foundation for future research in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Zhang, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread application of Large Speech Models (LSMs) has made their security risks increasingly prominent. Traditional speech adversarial attack methods face challenges in balancing effectiveness and stealth. This paper proposes Evolutionary Noise Jailbreak (ENJ), which utilizes a genetic algorithm to transform environmental noise from a passive interference into an actively optimizable attack carrier for jailbreaking LSMs. Through operations such as population initialization, crossover fusion, and probabilistic mutation, this method iteratively evolves a series of audio samples that fuse malicious instructions with background noise. These samples sound like harmless noise to humans but can induce the model to parse and execute harmful commands. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream speech models show that ENJ's attack effectiveness is significantly superior to existing baseline methods. This research reveals the dual role of noise in speech security and provides new critical insights for model security defense in complex acoustic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farbod Bijary, Mohsen Ebadpour, Amirhosein Tajbakhsh</p>
<p>Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation, due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns. Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names, while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000 tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset, Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mintae Kim, Jiaze Cai, Koushil Sreenath</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing robust controllers for precise, arbitrary trajectory tracking with quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that introduce extra degrees of freedom and hybridness. Classical model-based methods offer stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often do not adapt when the configuration changes, such as when a payload is added or removed, or when the payload mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified learning-based control framework in which a reinforcement learning (RL) policy serves as a robust and versatile tracking controller for standard quadrotors and for cable-suspended payload systems across a range of configurations. Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization across payload settings, including no payload as well as varying mass and cable length, without controller switching or re-tuning, while retaining the interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller.

<p>Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature topology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santhosh G S, Saurav Prakash, Balaraman Ravindran</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11167">Harnessing Optimization Dynamics for Curvature-Informed Model Merging</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pouria Mahdavinia, Hamed Mahdavi, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Mehrdad Mahdavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints, offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihong Zhang, Yuxuan Liu, Zhixin Li, Rui Sang, Yiqiang Cai, Yizhou Tan, Shengchen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) faces challenges in generalizing across recording devices, particularly when labeled data is limited. The DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 1 highlights this issue by requiring models to learn from small labeled subsets recorded on a few devices. These models need to then generalize to recordings from previously unseen devices under strict complexity constraints. While techniques such as data augmentation and the use of pre-trained models are well-established for improving model generalization, optimizing the training strategy represents a complementary yet less-explored path that introduces no additional architectural complexity or inference overhead. Among various training strategies, curriculum learning offers a promising paradigm by structuring the learning process from easier to harder examples. In this work, we propose an entropy-guided curriculum learning strategy to address the domain shift problem in data-efficient ASC. Specifically, we quantify the uncertainty of device domain predictions for each training sample by computing the Shannon entropy of the device posterior probabilities estimated by an auxiliary domain classifier. Using entropy as a proxy for domain invariance, the curriculum begins with high-entropy samples and gradually incorporates low-entropy, domain-specific ones to facilitate the learning of generalizable representations. Experimental results on multiple DCASE 2024 ASC baselines demonstrate that our strategy effectively mitigates domain shift, particularly under limited labeled data conditions. Our strategy is architecture-agnostic and introduces no additional inference cost, making it easily integrable into existing ASC baselines and offering a practical solution to domain shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simin Chen, Jinjun Peng, Yixin He, Junfeng Yang, Baishakhi Ray</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems, offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation.
  Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics. To our knowledge, this is the first work to expose inherent security risks in DL compiler design, opening a new direction for secure and trustworthy ML.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs) tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %, and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of both the stego and recovery images.

<p>Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field in computer science that has seen considerable progress in recent years, especially in machine learning. By harnessing the principles of quantum physics, it can surpass the limitations of classical algorithms. However, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), which rely on adjustable parameters, often face the barren plateau phenomenon, hindering optimization. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is a recent concept in classical machine learning that has led to notable improvements in parameter efficiency for neural networks. It states that within a large network, a smaller, more efficient subnetwork, or ''winning ticket,'' can achieve comparable performance, potentially circumventing plateau challenges. In this work, we investigate whether this idea can apply to VQCs. We show that the weak LTH holds for VQCs, revealing winning tickets that retain just 26.0\% of the original parameters. For the strong LTH, where a pruning mask is learned without any training, we discovered a winning ticket in a binary VQC, achieving 100\% accuracy with only 45\% of the weights. These findings indicate that LTH may mitigate barren plateaus by reducing parameter counts while preserving performance, thus enhancing the efficiency of VQCs in quantum machine learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongwon Park, Minku Kang, Wooseok Sim, Soyoung Lee, Hogun Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data, despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions. FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to address computational problems in ways that differ fundamentally from classical approaches. While current quantum hardware remains error-prone and limited in scale, Variational Quantum Circuits offer a noise-resilient framework suitable for today's devices. The performance of these circuits strongly depends on the underlying architecture of their parameterized quantum components. Identifying efficient, hardware-compatible quantum circuit architectures -- known as Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) -- is therefore essential. Manual QAS is complex and error-prone, motivating efforts to automate it. Among various automated strategies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains underexplored, particularly in Quantum Machine Learning contexts. This work introduces RL-QAS, a framework that applies RL to discover effective circuit architectures for classification tasks. We evaluate RL-QAS using the Iris and binary MNIST datasets. The agent autonomously discovers low-complexity circuit designs that achieve high test accuracy. Our results show that RL is a viable approach for automated architecture search in quantum machine learning. However, applying RL-QAS to more complex tasks will require further refinement of the search strategy and performance evaluation mechanisms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Practitioners increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate generative AI outputs through "LLM-as-a-Judge" approaches. However, these methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis of model behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johann Schmidt, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations, scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youzhi Liang, Eyan Noronha</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic systems deployed in real-world environments often operate under conditions of partial and often intermittent observability, where sensor inputs may be noisy, occluded, or entirely unavailable due to failures or environmental constraints. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that assume full state observability are ill-equipped for such challenges. In this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recurrent baselines, maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of explicit belief modeling in achieving robust, transferable, and data-efficient policies for real-world partially observable robotic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongwan Park, Jieun Woo, Siheon Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions. Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to 0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm (i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of modality-specific discrete encoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex environments closer to practice.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengze li, Yitong Zhang, Jia Li, Liyi Cai, Ge Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have become the mainstream approaches to code generation. Existing LLMs mainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token from left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two limitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a token at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is a non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive LLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic limitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation. Recently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion LLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token prediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible generation order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate tokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code generation. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study of diffusion LLMs for code generation. Our study involves 9 representative diffusion LLMs and conduct experiments on 4 widely used benchmarks. Based on the results, we summarize the following findings. (1) Existing diffusion LLMs are competitive with autoregressive LLMs with similar sizes. (2) Diffusion LLMs have a stronger length extrapolation ability than autoregressive LLMs and perform better in long code understanding. (3) We explore factors impacting the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion LLMs, and provide practical guidance. (4) We discuss several promising further directions to improve diffusion LLMs on code generation. We open-source all source code, data, and results to facilitate the following research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Schiff, Ofir Lindenbaum, Yonathan Efroni</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass, without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top 5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL with large pre trained transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen He, Zhigang Wang, Yanlong Peng, Pengxu Chang, Hong Yang, Ming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, the efficient disassembly and recycling of power batteries have become a critical challenge for the circular economy. In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex industrial environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Dopico-Castro, Oscar Fontenla-Romero, Bertha Guijarro-Berdi\~nas, Amparo Alonso-Betanzos</p>
<p>Abstract: Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This, combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are available.</p>

<p>Abstract: 6th Generation (6G) mobile networks are envisioned to support several new capabilities and data-centric applications for unprecedented number of users, potentially raising significant energy efficiency and sustainability concerns. This brings focus on sustainability as one of the key objectives in the their design. To move towards sustainable solution, research and standardization community is focusing on several key issues like energy information monitoring and exposure, use of renewable energy, and use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) for improving the energy efficiency in 6G networks. The goal is to build energy-aware solutions that takes into account the energy information resulting in energy efficient networks. Design of energy-aware 6G networks brings in new challenges like increased overheads in gathering and exposing of energy related information, and the associated user consent management. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of methods used for design of energy efficient 6G networks, like energy harvesting, energy models and parameters, classification of energy-aware services, and AI/ML-based solutions. The survey also includes few use cases that demonstrate the benefits of incorporating energy awareness into network decisions. Several ongoing standardization efforts in 3GPP, ITU, and IEEE are included to provide insights into the ongoing work and highlight the opportunities for new contributions. We conclude this survey with open research problems and challenges that can be explored to make energy-aware design feasible and ensure optimality regarding performance and energy goals for 6G networks.</p>

A key challenge is the scarcity of patient behavior data for developing robust policies. To address this, we engaged 33 expert healthcare practitioners as patient proxies, using their interactions with our robot to inform a patient behavior model capable of generating exercise performance metrics and subjective scores on perceived exertion. We trained a reinforcement learning-based policy in simulation, demonstrating that it can adapt exercise instructions to individual exertion tolerances and fluctuating performance, while also being applicable to patients at different recovery stages with varying exercise plans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhava Gaikwad</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenchao Gu, Yupan Chen, Yanlin Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Cuiyun Gao, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Software vulnerability detection has emerged as a significant concern in the field of software security recently, capturing the attention of numerous researchers and developers. Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained vulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the developers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large volume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific vulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of vulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization usually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling vulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence, the demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at the statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via multiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level labels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a function is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the vulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically, inspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the ground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual statements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These pseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level representation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach achieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art performance in statement-level vulnerability localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Song, Wei Mei, Yunfeng Xu, Qiang Fu, Renke Kou, Lina Bu, Yucheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinash Agarwal, Manisha J. Nene</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: The governance of artificial iintelligence (AI) systems requires a structured approach that connects high-level regulatory principles with practical implementation. Existing frameworks lack clarity on how regulations translate into conformity mechanisms, leading to gaps in compliance and enforcement. This paper addresses this critical gap in AI governance.
  Methodology/Approach: A five-layer AI governance framework is proposed, spanning from broad regulatory mandates to specific standards, assessment methodologies, and certification processes. By narrowing its scope through progressively focused layers, the framework provides a structured pathway to meet technical, regulatory, and ethical requirements. Its applicability is validated through two case studies on AI fairness and AI incident reporting.
  Findings: The case studies demonstrate the framework's ability to identify gaps in legal mandates, standardization, and implementation. It adapts to both global and region-specific AI governance needs, mapping regulatory mandates with practical applications to improve compliance and risk management.
  Practical Implications - By offering a clear and actionable roadmap, this work contributes to global AI governance by equipping policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders with a model to enhance compliance and risk management.
  Social Implications: The framework supports the development of policies that build public trust and promote the ethical use of AI for the benefit of society.
  Originality/Value: This study proposes a five-layer AI governance framework that bridges high-level regulatory mandates and implementation guidelines. Validated through case studies on AI fairness and incident reporting, it identifies gaps such as missing standardized assessment procedures and reporting mechanisms, providing a structured foundation for targeted governance measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Narsingh Ranabhat, Longwei Wang, Amit Kumar Patel, KC santosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations. Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware, resilient representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior. Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in non-stationary RL environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an important role in information extraction through the transformation of unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017), C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019), and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1 scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally, we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in relation extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: The petroleum industry faces unprecedented challenges in reservoir management, requiring rapid integration of complex multimodal datasets for real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anusha Sinha, Keltin Grimes, James Lucassen, Michael Feffer, Nathan VanHoudnos, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Hoda Heidari</p>
<p>Abstract: A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grigori Fursin, Daniel Altunay</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights. Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset, which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their available resources, requirements, and constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shresth Grover, Akshay Gopalkrishnan, Bo Ai, Henrik I. Christensen, Hao Su, Xuanlin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijia Xiao, Edward Sun, Tong Chen, Fang Wu, Di Luo, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shriyank Somvanshi, Pavan Hebli, Gaurab Chhetri, Subasish Das</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301 EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors, along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization, MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> BaiChen Fan, Sifan Zhou, Jian Li, Shibo Zhao, Muqing Cao, Qin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is available at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ahYgzmEWP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyi Wang, Ziwen Zeng, Yuan Li, Zijian Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Career exploration is uncertain, requiring decisions with limited information and unpredictable outcomes. While generative AI offers new opportunities for career guidance, most systems rely on linear chat interfaces that produce overly comprehensive and idealized suggestions, overlooking the non-linear and effortful nature of real-world trajectories. We present CareerPooler, a generative AI-powered system that employs a pool-table metaphor to simulate career development as a spatial and narrative interaction. Users strike balls representing milestones, skills, and random events, where hints, collisions, and rebounds embody decision-making under uncertainty. In a within-subjects study with 24 participants, CareerPooler significantly improved engagement, information gain, satisfaction, and career clarity compared to a chatbot baseline. Qualitative findings show that spatial-narrative interaction fosters experience-based learning, resilience through setbacks, and reduced psychological burden. Our findings contribute to the design of AI-assisted career exploration systems and more broadly suggest that visually grounded analogical interactions can make generative systems engaging and satisfying.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew G. Breithaupt, Nayoung Choi, James D. Finch, Jeanne M. Powell, Arin L. Nelson, Oz A. Alon, Howard J. Rosen, Jinho D. Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is critical for timely intervention, yet most diagnoses are delayed until advanced stages. While comprehensive patient narratives are essential for accurate diagnosis, prior work has largely focused on screening studies that classify cognitive status from interactions rather than supporting the diagnostic process. We designed voice-interactive conversational agents, leveraging large language models (LLMs), to elicit narratives relevant to ADRD from patients and informants. We evaluated the agent with 30 adults with suspected ADRD through conversation analysis (n=30), user surveys (n=19), and clinical validation against blinded specialist interviews (n=24). Symptoms detected by the agent aligned well with those identified by specialists across symptoms. Users appreciated the agent's patience and systematic questioning, which supported engagement and expression of complex, hard-to-describe experiences. This preliminary work suggests conversational agents may serve as structured front-end tools for dementia assessment, highlighting interaction design considerations in sensitive healthcare contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Eschmann, Dario Albani, Giuseppe Loianno</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions, like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs. rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller (PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000 quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).</p>

<p>Abstract: The collaborative efforts of large communities in science experiments, often comprising thousands of global members, reflect a monumental commitment to exploration and discovery. Recently, advanced and complex data processing has gained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows typically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of resource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources for effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is challenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels among community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing options. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially processing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from actual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this two-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the workflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential failures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for initial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses. In this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning models within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine learning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges posed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate forecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive decision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling diverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyang Hu, Naijie Gu, Xiangzhi Tao, Tianhui Gu, Yibing Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Jyoti Bajpai, Manjesh Kumar Hanawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks. Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy. We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the `hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs) at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs. Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of $2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Hu, Gang Tu, ShengYu Cheng, Jinxin Li, Jinting Wang, Rui Chen, Zhilong Zhou, Dongbo Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original, filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence.
  This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities.
  These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them. To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL) framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally, we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies. To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jizhuo Chen, Diwen Liu, Jiaming Wang, Harold Soh</p>
<p>Abstract: GBPP is a fast learning based scorer that selects a robot base pose for grasping from a single RGB-D snapshot. The method uses a two stage curriculum: (1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost; and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with targeted simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Gao, Xuelong Wang, Zhenguo Dong, Yong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables. However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off, we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad H. Ashiq, Peter Triantafillou, Hung Yun Tseng, Grigoris G. Chrysos</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence. This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional protection to end users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prerna Agarwal, Himanshu Gupta, Soujanya Soni, Rohith Vallam, Renuka Sindhgatta, Sameep Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has lead to the development of agents capable of complex reasoning and interaction with external tools. In enterprise contexts, the effective use of such tools that are often enabled by application programming interfaces (APIs), is hindered by poor documentation, complex input or output schema, and large number of operations. These challenges make tool selection difficult and reduce the accuracy of payload formation by up to 25%. We propose ACE, an automated tool creation and enrichment framework that transforms enterprise APIs into LLM-compatible tools. ACE, (i) generates enriched tool specifications with parameter descriptions and examples to improve selection and invocation accuracy, and (ii) incorporates a dynamic shortlisting mechanism that filters relevant tools at runtime, reducing prompt complexity while maintaining scalability. We validate our framework on both proprietary and open-source APIs and demonstrate its integration with agentic frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, ACE is the first end-to-end framework that automates the creation, enrichment, and dynamic selection of enterprise API tools for LLM agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Fei Ren, Shaobo Wang, Kaixin Li, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chentao Cao, Xiaojun Xu, Bo Han, Hang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks. Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm). Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyao Jiang, Jian Jiao, Xingjian Zhang, Ye Wang, Dusit Niyato, Qinyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of diverse and massive data in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, the task-agnostic semantic communication system is regarded to provide robust intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic learnable weighted-knowledge base semantic communication (TALSC) framework for robust image transmission to address the real-world heterogeneous data bias in KB, including label flipping noise and class imbalance. The TALSC framework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the semantic coding networks as learners. The learners are updated based on the empirical knowledge provided by the learnable weighted-KB (LW-KB). Meanwhile, the meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task loss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the robustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between SCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid extension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) within SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables scalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining. Simulations demonstrate that the TALSC framework effectively mitigates the effects of flipping noise and class imbalance in task-agnostic image semantic communication, achieving at least 12% higher semantic recovery accuracy (SRA) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Kartheek Reddy Kasu</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness, and responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy, beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its components and their interplay.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feilong Chen, Yijiang Liu, Yi Huang, Hao Wang, Miren Tian, Ya-Qi Yu, Minghui Liao, Jihao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs. Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haisheng Wang, Weiming Zhi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem, introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs) benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation, and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Wang, Xiaofei Xie, Qiang Hu, Shangqing Liu, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding, generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data. Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information. CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find CoachMe here: https://motionxperts.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding, Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiduo Huang, Fuwei Yang, Zhenhua Liu, Xuanwu Yin, Dong Li, Pengju Ren, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

<p>Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Casini, Laura Cros Vila, David Dalmazzo, Anna-Kaisa Kaila, Bob L. T. Sturm</p>
<p>Abstract: Online AI platforms for creating music from text prompts (AI music), such as Suno and Udio, are now being used by hundreds of thousands of users. Some AI music is appearing in advertising, and even charting, in multiple countries. How are these platforms being used? What subjects are inspiring their users? This article answers these questions for Suno and Udio using a large collection of songs generated by users of these platforms from May to October 2024. Using a combination of state-of-the-art text embedding models, dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, we analyze the prompts, tags and lyrics, and automatically annotate and display the processed data in interactive plots. Our results reveal prominent themes in lyrics, language preference, prompting strategies, as well as peculiar attempts at steering models through the use of metatags. To promote the musicological study of the developing cultural practice of AI-generated music we share our code and resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navid Hashemi, Samuel Sasaki, Diego Manzanas Lopez, Ipek Oguz, Meiyi Ma, Taylor T. Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this technique, available on Github.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodi Ma, Vyom Pathak, Daisy Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Travis Davies, Yiqi Huang, Yunxin Liu, Xiang Chen, Huxian Liu, Luhui Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabrina Patania, Luca Annese, Anna Lambiase, Anita Pellegrini, Tom Foulsham, Azzurra Ruggeri, Silvia Rossi, Silvia Serino, Dimitri Ognibene</p>
<p>Abstract: Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marian Renz, Felix Igelbrink, Martin Atzmueller</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MMORE, an open-source pipeline for Massive Multimodal Open RetrievalAugmented Generation and Extraction, designed to ingest, transform, and retrieve knowledge from heterogeneous document formats at scale. MMORE supports more than fifteen file types, including text, tables, images, emails, audio, and video, and processes them into a unified format to enable downstream applications for LLMs. The architecture offers modular, distributed processing, enabling scalable parallelization across CPUs and GPUs. On processing benchmarks, MMORE demonstrates a 3.8-fold speedup over single-node baselines and 40% higher accuracy than Docling on scanned PDFs. The pipeline integrates hybrid dense-sparse retrieval and supports both interactive APIs and batch RAG endpoints. Evaluated on PubMedQA, MMORE-augmented medical LLMs improve biomedical QA accuracy with increasing retrieval depth.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu\'is F. Gomes, Xin Zhou, David Lo, Rui Abreu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual documentation is an effective tool for reducing the cognitive barrier developers face when understanding unfamiliar code, enabling more intuitive comprehension. Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level understanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer visual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software systems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to evaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing approach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly from code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to standardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the first exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual documentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that combines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code and produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation framework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual documentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our approach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an improvement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline. Our evaluation framework can reliably distinguish high-quality (code-aligned) visual documentation from low-quality (non-aligned) ones, achieving an AUC exceeding 0.87. Our work lays the foundation for future research on automated visual documentation by introducing practical tools that not only generate valid visual representations but also reliably assess their quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulating hostile attacks of physical autonomous systems can be a useful tool to examine their robustness to attack and inform vulnerability-aware design. In this work, we examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol, by presenting a machine learning-based adversary model that observes robot patrol behavior in order to attempt to gain undetected access to a secure environment within a limited time duration. Such a model allows for evaluation of a patrol system against a realistic potential adversary, offering insight into future patrol strategy design. We show that our new model outperforms existing baselines, thus providing a more stringent test, and examine its performance against multiple leading decentralized multi-robot patrol strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumia Zohra El Mestari, Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak, Gabriele Lenzini</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralised clients while keeping local data private, making it a widely adopted privacy-enhancing technology (PET). Despite its privacy benefits, FL remains vulnerable to privacy attacks, including those targeting specific clients. In this paper, we study an underexplored threat where a dishonest orchestrator intentionally manipulates the aggregation process to induce targeted overfitting in the local models of specific clients. Whereas many studies in this area predominantly focus on reducing the amount of information leakage during training, we focus on enabling an early client-side detection of targeted overfitting, thereby allowing clients to disengage before significant harm occurs. In line with this, we propose three detection techniques - (a) label flipping, (b) backdoor trigger injection, and (c) model fingerprinting - that enable clients to verify the integrity of the global aggregation. We evaluated our methods on multiple datasets under different attack scenarios. Our results show that the three methods reliably detect targeted overfitting induced by the orchestrator, but they differ in terms of computational complexity, detection latency, and false-positive rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy. In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the "average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over 10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1) search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it. Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS) domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

<p>Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However, traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although browser-using agents (BUAs) show promise for web tasks and automation, most BUAs terminate after executing a single instruction, failing to support users' complex, nonlinear browsing with ambiguous goals, iterative decision-making, and changing contexts. We present a human-in-the-loop (HITL) conceptual framework informed by theories of human web browsing behavior. The framework centers on an iterative loop in which the BUA proactively proposes next actions and the user steers the browsing process through feedback. It also distinguishes between exploration and exploitation actions, enabling users to control the breadth and depth of their browsing. Consequently, the framework aims to reduce users' physical and cognitive effort while preserving users' traditional browsing mental model and supporting users in achieving satisfactory outcomes. We illustrate how the framework operates with hypothetical use cases and discuss the shift from manual browsing to interaction-driven browsing. We contribute a theoretically informed conceptual framework for BUAs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujun Lin, Zhekai Zhang, Song Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern tensor applications, especially foundation models and generative AI applications require multiple input modalities (both vision and language), which increases the demand for flexible accelerator architecture. Existing frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge, we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models in generative AI applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qin Tan, Xiatian Zhu, Owen Addison, Yunpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top 3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2 achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with an average inference time of XX (TBC during the ODIN workshop). In Task 2, U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 with the held-out test data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/UMamba2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Narimani, Alireza Pourreza, Ali Moghimi, Parastoo Farajpoor, Hamid Jafarbiglu, Mohsen B. Mesgaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic weed that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host. We investigate early detection using leaf-level spectral reflectance (400-2500 nm) and ensemble machine learning. In a field experiment in Woodland, California, we tracked 300 tomato plants across growth stages defined by growing degree days (GDD). Leaf reflectance was acquired with a portable spectrometer and preprocessed (band denoising, 1 nm interpolation, Savitzky-Golay smoothing, correlation-based band reduction). Clear class differences were observed near 1500 nm and 2000 nm water absorption features, consistent with reduced leaf water content in infected plants at early stages. An ensemble combining Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM with RBF kernel, and Naive Bayes achieved 89% accuracy at 585 GDD, with recalls of 0.86 (infected) and 0.93 (noninfected). Accuracy declined at later stages (e.g., 69% at 1568 GDD), likely due to senescence and weed interference. Despite the small number of infected plants and environmental confounders, results show that proximal sensing with ensemble learning enables timely detection of broomrape before canopy symptoms are visible, supporting targeted interventions and reduced yield losses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Wang, Peng Tao, Jifan Shi, Rui Bao, Rui Liu, Luonan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirudha Majumdar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss. In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is deployed in.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Payam Latifi</p>
<p>Abstract: This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models (LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119 tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME). We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names, with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC) environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art, general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Synthia Wang, Yuwei Cheng, Austin Song, Sarah Keedy, Marc Berman, Nick Feamster</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited access to mental health care has motivated the use of digital tools and conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs), yet their quality and reception remain unclear. We present a study comparing therapist-written responses to those generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama for real patient questions. Text analysis showed that LLMs produced longer, more readable, and lexically richer responses with a more positive tone, while therapist responses were more often written in the first person. In a survey with 150 users and 23 licensed therapists, participants rated LLM responses as clearer, more respectful, and more supportive than therapist-written answers. Yet, both groups of participants expressed a stronger preference for human therapist support. These findings highlight the promise and limitations of LLMs in mental health, underscoring the need for designs that balance their communicative strengths with concerns of trust, privacy, and accountability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically generate direct answers, yet they are increasingly used as learning tools. Studying instructors' usage is critical, given their role in teaching and guiding AI adoption in education. We designed and evaluated TeaPT, an LLM for pedagogical purposes that supports instructors' professional development through two conversational approaches: a Socratic approach that uses guided questioning to foster reflection, and a Narrative approach that offers elaborated suggestions to extend externalized cognition. In a mixed-method study with 41 higher-education instructors, the Socratic version elicited greater engagement, while the Narrative version was preferred for actionable guidance. Subgroup analyses further revealed that less-experienced, AI-optimistic instructors favored the Socratic version, whereas more-experienced, AI-cautious instructors preferred the Narrative version. We contribute design implications for LLMs for pedagogical purposes, showing how adaptive conversational approaches can support instructors with varied profiles while highlighting how AI attitudes and experience shape interaction and learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryaman Reddi, Gabriele Tiboni, Jan Peters, Carlo D'Eramo</p>
<p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yan, Zheyu Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, Wen-Hua Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, especially when AI-based sensing and perception modules are involved. However, due to the black box nature of AI algorithms, it makes closed-loop analysis and synthesis particularly challenging, for example, establishing closed-loop stability and ensuring performance, while they are fundamental to AV safety. To approach this difficulty, this paper aims to develop new modeling, analysis, and synthesis tools for AI-based AVs. Inspired by recent developments in perception error models (PEMs), the focus is shifted from directly modeling AI-based perception processes to characterizing the perception errors they produce. Two key classes of AI-induced perception errors are considered: misdetection and measurement noise. These error patterns are modeled using continuous-time Markov chains and Wiener processes, respectively. By means of that, a PEM-augmented driving model is proposed, with which we are able to establish the closed-loop stability for a class of AI-driven AV systems via stochastic calculus. Furthermore, a performance-guaranteed output feedback control synthesis method is presented, which ensures both stability and satisfactory performance. The method is formulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient numerical solutions. The results are then applied to an adaptive cruise control (ACC) scenario, demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness despite the corrupted and misleading perception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nojod M. Alotaibi, Areej M. Alhothali, Manar S. Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health. Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p>

XR-0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most multi-anatomy tasks and remains competitive on chest-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that anatomical diversity and supervision are critical for building robust, general-purpose medical vision models, paving the way for scalable and adaptable AI systems in radiology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can infer personal attributes from seemingly innocuous text, raising privacy risks beyond memorized data leakage. While prior work has demonstrated these risks, little is known about how users estimate and respond. We conducted a survey with 240 U.S. participants who judged text snippets for inference risks, reported concern levels, and attempted rewrites to block inference. We compared their rewrites with those generated by ChatGPT and Rescriber, a state-of-the-art sanitization tool. Results show that participants struggled to anticipate inference, performing a little better than chance. User rewrites were effective in just 28\% of cases - better than Rescriber but worse than ChatGPT. We examined our participants' rewriting strategies, and observed that while paraphrasing was the most common strategy it is also the least effective; instead abstraction and adding ambiguity were more successful. Our work highlights the importance of inference-aware design in LLM interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in UI2Code tasks, significantly enhancing website development efficiency. However, these tasks incur substantially higher computational overhead than traditional code generation due to the large number of input image tokens and extensive output code tokens required. Our comprehensive study identifies significant redundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational complexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively lengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a compression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key components. First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves essential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI element trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores to discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating high-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token Suppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS structure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments show EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising webpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing computational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%, and inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/WebPAI/EfficientUICoder.</p>

<p>Abstract: Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are becoming key components in an autonomous vehicle (AV), especially in handling complicated perception tasks. However, closing the loop through AI-based feedback may pose significant risks on reliability of autonomous driving due to very limited understanding about the mechanism of AI-driven perception processes. To overcome it, this paper aims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of AI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability, robustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense. First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex optimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results are applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johanna Karras, Yingwei Li, Yasamin Jafarian, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3 images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates 360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space. During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas" representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild garments from images and videos.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Mohamadi, Ali Yavari</p>
<p>Abstract: When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hunjae Lee, Corey Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12458">A dancing bear, a colleague, or a sharpened toolbox? The cautious adoption of generative AI technologies in digital humanities research</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongqian Ma, Meredith Dedema, Andrew Cox</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has been changing the research landscape and potentially has significant implications for Digital Humanities (DH), a field inherently intertwined with technologies. This article investigates how DH scholars adopt and critically evaluate GenAI technologies for research. Drawing on 76 responses collected from an international survey study and 15 semi-structured interviews with DH scholars, we explored the rationale for adopting GenAI tools in research, identified the specific practices of using GenAI tools, and analyzed scholars' collective perceptions regarding the benefits, risks, and challenges. The results reveal that DH research communities hold divided opinions and differing imaginations towards the role of GenAI in DH scholarship. While scholars acknowledge the benefits of GenAI in enhancing research efficiency and enabling reskilling, many remain concerned about its potential to disrupt their intellectual identities. Situated within the history of DH and viewed through the lens of Actor-Network Theory, our findings suggest that the adoption of GenAI is gradually changing the field, though this transformation remains contested, shaped by ongoing negotiations among multiple human and non-human actors. Our study is one of the first empirical analyses on this topic and has the potential to serve as a building block for future inquiries into the impact of GenAI on DH scholarship.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nasim Borazjanizadeh, Roei Herzig, Trevor Darrell, Rogerio Feris, Leonid Karlinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance in math and reasoning benchmarks. However, they often struggle with logic problems and puzzles that are relatively easy for humans. To further investigate this, we introduce a new benchmark, SearchBench, which contains 11 unique search problems inspired by intuitive puzzles. Each SearchBench problem type is equipped with automated pipelines to generate an arbitrary number of instances and analyze the feasibility, correctness, and optimality of LLM-generated solutions. We show that using step-by-step, language-only reasoning, even the most advanced LLMs fail to solve SearchBench; for example, OpenAI's frontier models GPT-4 and o1-preview solve only 1.4% and 18.6% of problems, respectively. The reason is that SearchBench problems require considering multiple pathways and performing backtracking, posing a significant challenge to auto-regressive models. Interestingly, performance is significantly boosted when we prompt models to generate a complete A* search algorithm - a comparatively more cognitively difficult task. This approach effectively offloads the iterative search and backtracking process from the models, which they struggle with in text. This in-context learning baseline is further enhanced via a Multi-Stage-Multi-Try (MSMT) inference method, increasing GPT-4's rate of correct solutions to over 57%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Berto, Chuanbo Hua, Nayeli Gast Zepeda, Andr\'e Hottung, Niels Wouda, Leon Lan, Junyoung Park, Kevin Tierney, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces RouteFinder, a comprehensive foundation model framework to tackle different Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any combination of these attributes. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 48 VRP variants show RouteFinder outperforms recent state-of-the-art learning methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai4co/routefinder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Ossowski, Jixuan Chen, Danyal Maqbool, Zefan Cai, Tyler Bradshaw, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile agents are essential for automating tasks in complex and dynamic mobile environments. As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

This survey provides an overview of the evolution, capabilities, and applications of LLM-based data agents, highlighting their role in simplifying complex data tasks and lowering the entry barrier for users without related expertise. We explore current trends in the design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address data-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze several case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data agents in real-world scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) provides critical planetary data for environmental monitoring, disaster management, climate science, and other scientific domains. Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Zhang, Nuoqian Xiao, Qi Chai, Deheng Ye, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohui Yang, Yuxiao Ye, Shilei Jiang, Chen Hu, Linjing Li, Shihong Deng, Daxin Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyin Chen, Jiarui Lu, Minsu Kim, Dinghuai Zhang, Jian Tang, Alexandre Pich\'e, Nicolas Gontier, Yoshua Bengio, Ehsan Kamalloo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering (Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asim H. Gazi, Bhanu Teja Gullapalli, Daiqi Gao, Benjamin M. Marlin, Vivek Shetty, Susan A. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points," intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur. Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour) before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective. In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68 participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive, habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqing Wang, Liqiang Xiao, Chang Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head & neck (H&N) cancers involves numerous conflicting objectives, requiring iterative objective parameter adjustments to balance multiple clinical goals. We propose a learning-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans for patients with diverse treatment requirements. The inverse optimizer is a learning-to-optimize (L2O) method that predicts update steps by learning from task-specific data distributions. For the first time, long-context processing techniques developed for large language models (LLMs) are utilized to address the scalability limitations of existing L2O methods, enabling simultaneous optimization over a substantially large set of variables. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable spot monitor unit (MU) values based on the PPO-refined objectives. Moreover, a Swin UnetR dose predictor is trained with prescription- and beam-specific information to estimate the initial objective parameters. In our experiments, total 97 patients with bilateral or ipsilateral H&N cancers are collected for training and testing. Compared with the second-order gradient-based methods, our L2O optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the time-consuming inverse optimization by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively, and in conjunction with the PPO-based virtual planner, plans are generated within clinically acceptable times, i.e. 2.55 hours in average, and shows improved or comparable organs-at-risk sparing with superior target coverage compared with human-generated plans.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method with general-purpose LLMs yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while also achieving approximately 85% on S1-Bench (System-1), surpassing the baseline by over 20%. Its reasoning traces average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Shukla</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance [7]. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhava Gaikwad</p>
<p>Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback under misspecification. Sometimes human feedback is systematically wrong on certain types of inputs, like a broken compass that points the wrong way in specific regions. We prove that when feedback is biased on a fraction alpha of contexts with bias strength epsilon, any learning algorithm needs exponentially many samples exp(n*alpha*epsilon^2) to distinguish between two possible "true" reward functions that differ only on these problematic contexts. However, if you can identify where feedback is unreliable (a "calibration oracle"), you can focus your limited questions there and overcome the exponential barrier with just O(1/(alpha*epsilon^2)) queries. This quantifies why alignment is hard: rare edge cases with subtly biased feedback create an exponentially hard learning problem unless you know where to look.
  The gap between what we optimize (proxy from human feedback) and what we want (true objective) is fundamentally limited by how common the problematic contexts are (alpha), how wrong the feedback is there (epsilon), and how much the true objectives disagree there (gamma). Murphy's Law for AI alignment: the gap always wins unless you actively route around misspecification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select" cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering. Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points, demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch" reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Bhavul Gauri, Zining Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation, code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task, utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns, vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation; speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late, elaborative iteration. Together, the framework and metrics make iteration measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or switch strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with multiple golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight the performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong reasoning abilities of closed-source models, and the remaining room for improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Crystal Qian, Kehang Zhu, John Horton, Benjamin S. Manning, Vivian Tsai, James Wexler, Nithum Thain</p>
<p>Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore, different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents, such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minhyuk Kim, Seungyoon Lee, Heuiseok Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples, limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs benchmarks with reasonable rationales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Han, Ziqi Wang, Han Zhao, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have initiated a paradigm shift in transfer learning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in order to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capability of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing a kernel-regression perspective of understanding LLMs' ICL bahaviors when faced with in-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on in-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat y = \sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-context demonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors of language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden features in LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory provides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: why retrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICL performance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits from selecting in-distribution and representative samples.

<p>Abstract: Calibrating deep neural models plays an important role in building reliable, robust AI systems in safety-critical applications. Recent work has shown that modern neural networks that possess high predictive capability are poorly calibrated and produce unreliable model predictions. Though deep learning models achieve remarkable performance on various benchmarks, the study of model calibration and reliability is relatively under-explored. Ideal deep models should have not only high predictive performance but also be well calibrated. There have been some recent advances in calibrating deep models. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art calibration methods and their principles for performing model calibration. First, we start with the definition of model calibration and explain the root causes of model miscalibration. Then we introduce the key metrics that can measure this aspect. It is followed by a summary of calibration methods that we roughly classify into four categories: post-hoc calibration, regularization methods, uncertainty estimation, and composition methods. We also cover recent advancements in calibrating large models, particularly large language models (LLMs). Finally, we discuss some open issues, challenges, and potential directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of downstream tasks, a significant concern revolves around their propensity to exhibit hallucinations: LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from the user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge. This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets.

<p>Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level multi-image reasoning and visual working memory is not well-established. One such challenge is matrix reasoning - the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the matrix reasoning tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA to evaluate the visual cognition capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human visual cognition studies. Based on the training data of MaRs-VQA, we also finetune a baseline model Qwen2-VCog with multi-stage cognition reasoning annotations. Our comparative experiments with different baselines reveal a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence, highlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that the public release of MaRs-VQA and the Qwen2-VCog baseline model will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with human-like visual cognition abilities. MaRs-VQA is available at huggingface.co/datasets/IrohXu/VCog-Bench. The training code of Qwen2-VCog is available at github.com/IrohXu/Cognition-MLLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Can large multimodal models have a human-like ability for emotional and social reasoning, and if so, how does it work? Recent research has discovered emergent theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). LLMs can reason about people's mental states by solving various text-based ToM tasks that ask questions about the actors' ToM (e.g., human belief, desire, intention). However, human reasoning in the wild is often grounded in dynamic scenes across time. Thus, we consider videos a new medium for examining spatio-temporal ToM reasoning ability. Specifically, we ask explicit probing questions about videos with abundant social and emotional reasoning content. We develop a pipeline for multimodal LLM for ToM reasoning using video and text. We also enable explicit ToM reasoning by retrieving key frames for answering a ToM question, which reveals how multimodal LLMs reason about ToM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Common approaches to providing feedback in reinforcement learning are the use of hand-crafted rewards or full-trajectory expert demonstrations. Alternatively, one can use examples of completed tasks, but such an approach can be extremely sample inefficient. We introduce value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE), an algorithm that significantly improves exploration in example-based control by adding examples of simple auxiliary tasks and an above-success-level value penalty. Across both simulated and real robotic environments, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency for challenging tasks, while maintaining bounded value estimates. Preliminary results also suggest that VPACE may learn more efficiently than the more common approaches of using full trajectories or true sparse rewards.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wang, K. Sudhir, Dat Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Enterprises deploying LLMs for goal-oriented dialogs, such as customer service, face a critical trade-off between performance, control, and cost. Proprietary models like GPT-4 offer strong performance but are costly and cannot be self-hosted, raising security and privacy concerns. Open-source alternatives offer flexibility and lower token costs but lag in performance. We introduce Guidance Elicitation and Retrieval (GER), a prompt-based knowledge distillation framework where a high-performance teacher LLM coaches a lower-performance student without modifying the student's parameters. GER extracts tactical guidance for a wide range of dialog scenarios from the teacher and stores these scenario-guidance pairs in a structured library. At inference time, the student retrieves the relevant guidance and integrates it into its prompt. While GER training can be bootstrapped entirely with synthetic data, its modular design lets it seamlessly augment the synthetic data with human conversational logs. In addition, the modular design enables easy auditing and updating of the guidance library as new scenarios and constraints emerge. Experiments show GER's guidance-based coaching outperforms both example output based fine-tuning and non-customized guidance baselines, and generalizes across other contexts and student models. The GER framework is potentially extensible to coach human service agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carina I. Hausladen, Manuel Knott, Colin F. Camerer, Pietro Perona</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore social perception of human faces in CLIP, a widely used open-source vision-language model. To this end, we compare the similarity in CLIP embeddings between different textual prompts and a set of face images. Our textual prompts are constructed from well-validated social psychology terms denoting social perception. The face images are synthetic and are systematically and independently varied along six dimensions: the legally protected attributes of age, gender, and race, as well as facial expression, lighting, and pose. Independently and systematically manipulating face attributes allows us to study the effect of each on social perception and avoids confounds that can occur in wild-collected data due to uncontrolled systematic correlations between attributes. Thus, our findings are experimental rather than observational. Our main findings are three. First, while CLIP is trained on the widest variety of images and texts, it is able to make fine-grained human-like social judgments on face images. Second, age, gender, and race do systematically impact CLIP's social perception of faces, suggesting an undesirable bias in CLIP vis-a-vis legally protected attributes. Most strikingly, we find a strong pattern of bias concerning the faces of Black women, where CLIP produces extreme values of social perception across different ages and facial expressions. Third, facial expression impacts social perception more than age and lighting as much as age. The last finding predicts that studies that do not control for unprotected visual attributes may reach the wrong conclusions on bias. Our novel method of investigation, which is founded on the social psychology literature and on the experiments involving the manipulation of individual attributes, yields sharper and more reliable observations than previous observational methods and may be applied to study biases in any vision-language model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanjun Lyu, Zihao Wu, Lu Zhang, Jing Zhang, Yiwei Li, Wei Ruan, Zhengliang Liu, Xiang Li, Rongjie Liu, Chao Huang, Wentao Li, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhyun An, Minji Kim, Hyounghun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning -- supervised fine-tuning using instruction-response pairs -- is a key step in making pre-trained large language models (LLMs) instructable. Meanwhile, LLMs perform multitask learning during their pre-training, acquiring extensive knowledge and capabilities. We hypothesize that the pre-training stage can enable them to develop the ability to comprehend and address instructions. To verify this, we propose Response Tuning (RT), which removes the instruction and its corresponding mapping to the response from instruction tuning. Instead, it focuses solely on establishing a response distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that RT models, trained only on responses, can effectively respond to a wide range of instructions akin to their instruction-tuned counterparts. In addition, we observe that the models can recognize and reject unsafe queries after learning a safety policy only from the response data. Furthermore, we find that these observations extend to an in-context learning setting. These findings support our hypothesis, highlighting the extensive inherent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhi Yang, Xinyu Wang, Ruipeng Zhang, Cong Wang, Frans A. Oliehoek, Jens Kober</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental objective in intelligent robotics is to move towards lifelong learning robot that can learn and adapt to unseen scenarios over time. However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zedian Shao, Hongbin Liu, Jaden Mu, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt injection attack, where an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an Large Language Model (LLM) follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task, represent a critical security threat. Existing attacks primarily focus on crafting these injections at inference time, treating the LLM itself as a static target. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we introduces a more foundational attack vector: poisoning the LLM's alignment process to amplify the success of future prompt injection attacks. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method that strategically creates poisoned alignment samples to poison an LLM's alignment dataset. Our experiments across five LLMs and two alignment datasets show that when even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned, the resulting model becomes substantially more vulnerable to a wide range of prompt injection attacks. Crucially, this vulnerability is instilled while the LLM's performance on standard capability benchmarks remains largely unchanged, making the manipulation difficult to detect through automated, general-purpose performance evaluations. The code for implementing the attack is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqing Bo, Ansh Soni, Sudhanshu Srivastava, Meenakshi Khosla</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices generates vast interaction data, offering insights into user behaviour. While prior work predicts what actions users perform, the timing of these actions -- critical for enabling proactive and efficient smart systems -- remains relatively underexplored. Addressing this gap, we focus on predicting the time of the next user action in smart environments. Due to the lack of public datasets with fine-grained timestamps suitable for this task and associated privacy concerns, we contribute a dataset of 11.6k sequences synthesized based on human annotations of interaction patterns, pairing actions with precise timestamps. To this end, we introduce Timing-Matters, a Transformer-Encoder based method that predicts action timing, achieving 38.30% accuracy on the synthesized dataset, outperforming the best baseline by 6%, and showing 1--6% improvements on other open datasets. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under US $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Abaskohi, Spandana Gella, Giuseppe Carenini, Issam H. Laradji</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering (MMQA) requires reasoning over images and text from multiple sources. Despite advances in visual question answering, this multihop setting remains underexplored due to a lack of quality datasets. Existing methods focus on single-hop, single-modality, or short texts, limiting real-world applications like interpreting educational documents with long, multimodal content. To fill this gap, we introduce FM2DS, the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset for MMQA. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure data quality. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks: MultimodalQA and WebQA. Our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) score on average. Additionally, we introduce M2QA-Bench with 1k samples, the first benchmark for MMQA on long documents, generated using FM2DS and refined by human annotators. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating MMQA models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10869">TinySubNets: An efficient and low capacity continual learning strategy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcin Pietro\'n, Kamil Faber, Dominik \.Zurek, Roberto Corizzo</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a highly relevant setting gaining traction in recent machine learning research. Among CL works, architectural and hybrid strategies are particularly effective due to their potential to adapt the model architecture as new tasks are presented. However, many existing solutions do not efficiently exploit model sparsity, and are prone to capacity saturation due to their inefficient use of available weights, which limits the number of learnable tasks. In this paper, we propose TinySubNets (TSN), a novel architectural CL strategy that addresses the issues through the unique combination of pruning with different sparsity levels, adaptive quantization, and weight sharing. Pruning identifies a subset of weights that preserve model performance, making less relevant weights available for future tasks. Adaptive quantization allows a single weight to be separated into multiple parts which can be assigned to different tasks. Weight sharing between tasks boosts the exploitation of capacity and task similarity, allowing for the identification of a better trade-off between model accuracy and capacity. These features allow TSN to efficiently leverage the available capacity, enhance knowledge transfer, and reduce computational resource consumption. Experimental results involving common benchmark CL datasets and scenarios show that our proposed strategy achieves better results in terms of accuracy than existing state-of-the-art CL strategies. Moreover, our strategy is shown to provide a significantly improved model capacity exploitation. Code released at: https://github.com/lifelonglab/tinysubnets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodi Ma, Dzmitry Kasinets, Daisy Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict missing links in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging information from various modalities alongside structural data. Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.</p>

In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Garg, Yue Jiang, Antti Oulasvirta</p>
<p>Abstract: During the early stages of interface design, designers need to produce multiple sketches to explore a design space. Design tools often fail to support this critical stage, because they insist on specifying more details than necessary. Although recent advances in generative AI have raised hopes of solving this issue, in practice they fail because expressing loose ideas in a prompt is impractical. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based approach to the low-effort generation of interface sketches. It breaks new ground by allowing flexible control of the generation process via three types of inputs: A) prompts, B) wireframes, and C) visual flows. The designer can provide any combination of these as input at any level of detail, and will get a diverse gallery of low-fidelity solutions in response. The unique benefit is that large design spaces can be explored rapidly with very little effort in input-specification. We present qualitative results for various combinations of input specifications. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model aligns more accurately with these specifications than other models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS), enabling enhanced communication, task planning, and human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Abstract: For individuals with blindness or low vision (BLV), navigating complex environments can pose serious risks. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for generating scene descriptions, but their effectiveness for BLV users remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with eight BLV participants to systematically evaluate preferences for six types of LVLM descriptions. While they helped to reduce fear and improve actionability, user ratings showed wide variation in sufficiency and conciseness. Furthermore, GPT-4o--despite its strong potential to refine descriptions--was not consistently preferred by participants. We use the insights obtained from the user study to build training data for building our new automatic evaluation metric that can capture BLV preferences effectively. Our findings underscore the urgent need for BLV-centered evaluation metrics and human-in-the-loop feedback to advance LVLM description quality for accessibility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness analysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longchao Da, Xiaoou Liu, Jiaxin Dai, Lu Cheng, Yaqing Wang, Hua Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the uncertainty in large language model (LLM) explanations is important for evaluating their faithfulness and reasoning consistency, and thus provides insights into the reliability of LLM's output regarding a question. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.</p>

Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging plays a pivotal role in modern healthcare, with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) being a critical tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism and other thoracic conditions. However, the complexity of interpreting CTPA scans and generating accurate radiology reports remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Abn-BLIP (Abnormality-aligned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), an advanced diagnosis model designed to align abnormal findings to generate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of radiology reports. By leveraging learnable queries and cross-modal attention mechanisms, our model demonstrates superior performance in detecting abnormalities, reducing missed findings, and generating structured reports compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that Abn-BLIP outperforms state-of-the-art medical vision-language models and 3D report generation methods in both accuracy and clinical relevance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Lai, Junjie Li, Chuan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Linear Integer Arithmetic, SMT(LIA) for short, is pivotal across various critical domains. Previous research has primarily focused on SMT solving techniques. However, in practical applications such as software and hardware testing, there is a need to generate a diverse set of solutions for use as test inputs. We have developed the first sampling framework that integrates local search with CDCL(T) techniques, named HighDiv, capable of generating a highly diverse set of solutions for constraints under linear integer theory. Initially, in the local search phase, we introduced a novel operator called boundary-aware movement. This operator performs random moves by considering the current state's constraints on variables, thereby enhancing the diversity of variables during the search process. Furthermore, we have conducted an in-depth study of the preprocessing and variable initialization mechanisms within the framework, which significantly enhances the efficiency of subsequent local searches. Lastly, we use the solutions obtained from local search sampling as additional constraints to further explore the solution space using the stochastic CDCL(T) method. Experimental results demonstrate that \HighDiv generates solutions with greater diversity compared to the state-of-the-art SMT(LIA) sampling tool, MeGASampler.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyros Kondylatos, Nikolaos Ioannis Bountos, Dimitrios Michail, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Gustau Camps-Valls, Ioannis Papoutsis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Computer Vision have introduced the concept of pretrained representation uncertainty, enabling zero-shot uncertainty estimation. This holds significant potential for Earth Observation (EO), where trustworthiness is critical, yet the complexity of EO data poses challenges to uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field.

<p>Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Junyan Wang, Victor Xiaoqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang He, Yixing Luo, Chengcheng Wan, Ting Su, Haiying Sun, Geguang Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: Atomicity violations in interrupt-driven programs pose a significant threat to software reliability in safety-critical systems. These violations occur when the execution sequence of operations on shared resources is disrupted by asynchronous interrupts. Detecting atomicity violations is challenging due to the vast program state space, application-level code dependencies, and complex domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose CLOVER, a multi-agent framework for detecting atomicity violations in real-world interrupt-driven programs. Its plan agent orchestrates four static analysis tools to extract key information and generate code summaries. CLOVER then initializes several Expert-Judge agent pairs to detect and validate different patterns of atomicity violation, through an iterative manner. Evaluations on RaceBench, SV-COMP, and RWIP demonstrate that CLOVER achieves a precision/recall of 91.0%/96.4%, outperforming existing approaches by 33.0-117.2% on F1-score. Additionally, it identifies 12 atomicity violations in 11 real-world aerospace software projects, one of which is previously unknown.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic crash detection in long-form surveillance videos is essential for improving emergency response and infrastructure planning, yet remains difficult due to the brief and infrequent nature of crash events. We present \textbf{HybridMamba}, a novel architecture integrating visual transformers with state-space temporal modeling to achieve high-precision crash time localization. Our approach introduces multi-level token compression and hierarchical temporal processing to maintain computational efficiency without sacrificing temporal resolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the Iowa Department of Transportation, HybridMamba achieves a mean absolute error of \textbf{1.50 seconds} for 2-minute videos ($p<0.01$ compared to baselines), with \textbf{65.2%} of predictions falling within one second of the ground truth. It outperforms recent video-language models (e.g., TimeChat, VideoLLaMA-2) by up to 3.95 seconds while using significantly fewer parameters (3B vs. 13--72B). Our results demonstrate effective temporal localization across various video durations (2--40 minutes) and diverse environmental conditions, highlighting HybridMamba's potential for fine-grained temporal localization in traffic surveillance while identifying challenges that remain for extended deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuya Ogasa, Yuki Arase</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the problem of hallucinated span detection in the outputs of large language models. It has received less attention than output-level hallucination detection despite its practical importance. Prior work has shown that attentions often exhibit irregular patterns when hallucinations occur. Motivated by these findings, we extract features from the attention matrix that provide complementary views capturing (a) whether certain tokens are influential or ignored, (b) whether attention is biased toward specific subsets, and (c) whether a token is generated referring to a narrow or broad context, in the generation. These features are input to a Transformer-based classifier to conduct sequential labelling to identify hallucinated spans. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines on hallucinated span detection with longer input contexts, such as data-to-text and summarisation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Chen, Cheng Zhu, Shuijing Liu, Yunzhu Li, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool use is essential for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, but learning such skills requires extensive datasets. While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\% and 41\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Orthonormalized updates accelerate training, improve stability, and enable robust hyperparameter transfer, but existing methods like Muon rely on dense matrix operations that clash with sharded weights in large-scale LLM training, causing high compute and communication cost. We introduce Dion (Distributed Orthonormalization), a scalable and efficient update rule that replaces Newton-Schulz iteration with amortized power iteration on a momentum buffer, avoiding full-matrix reconstruction and integrating cleanly with weight sharding. The rank-fraction parameter with error feedback enables low-rank updates that balance quality with significant cost savings. On language models from 160M to 3B parameters, Dion retains the benefits of orthonormalized updates, while markedly reducing wall-clock time at scale, making it a practical optimizer for next-generation foundation models.

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent large language model simulations have the potential to model complex human behaviors and interactions. If the mechanics are set up properly, unanticipated and valuable social dynamics can surface. However, it is challenging to consistently enforce simulation mechanics while still allowing for notable and emergent dynamics. We present AgentDynEx, an AI system that helps set up simulations from user-specified mechanics and dynamics. AgentDynEx uses LLMs to guide users through a Configuration Matrix to identify core mechanics and define milestones to track dynamics. It also introduces a method called \textit{nudging}, where the system dynamically reflects on simulation progress and gently intervenes if it begins to deviate from intended outcomes. A technical evaluation found that nudging enables simulations to have more complex mechanics and maintain its notable dynamics compared to simulations without nudging. We discuss the importance of nudging as a technique for balancing mechanics and dynamics of multi-agent simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupei Liu, Yuqi Jia, Jinyuan Jia, Dawn Song, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an attacker injects prompts into their inputs to induce attacker-desired outputs. A detection method aims to determine whether a given input is contaminated by an injected prompt. However, existing detection methods have limited effectiveness against state-of-the-art attacks, let alone adaptive ones. In this work, we propose DataSentinel, a game-theoretic method to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, DataSentinel fine-tunes an LLM to detect inputs contaminated with injected prompts that are strategically adapted to evade detection. We formulate this as a minimax optimization problem, with the objective of fine-tuning the LLM to detect strong adaptive attacks. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based method to solve the minimax optimization problem by alternating between the inner max and outer min problems. Our evaluation results on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs show that DataSentinel effectively detects both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang He, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to their application in password guessing, with the aim of replicating the complexity, structure, and patterns of human-created passwords. Despite their potential, inconsistencies and inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered meaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their capabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic characterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the context of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets and covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over 15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions learned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark generative password-guessing models.

We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data.

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, the field still lacks a practical platform that enables dynamic model updates, rapid validation, fair comparison, and intuitive performance assessment. To that end, we introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. LightEMMA provides a unified, VLM-based autonomous driving framework without ad hoc customizations, enabling easy integration with evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their performance on the challenging nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing computational metrics and providing critical insights. Illustrative examples show that, although VLMs exhibit strong scenario interpretation capabilities, their practical performance in autonomous driving tasks remains a concern. Additionally, increased model complexity and extended reasoning do not necessarily lead to better performance, emphasizing the need for further improvements and task-specific designs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Ma, Xuhui Jiang, Chengjin Xu, Cehao Yang, Liyu Zhang, Jian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve the quality of synthetic data, we integrate two complementary strategies, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC), to enhance both reasoning capability and discriminative power. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoG surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multi-hop and domain-specific question answering, while achieving competitive performance on long-context reading comprehension. These results highlight the superior generalization ability of SoG. Our work advances the paradigm of synthetic data generation and offers practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, particularly for downstream tasks and domains with limited training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motion capture (mocap) data often exhibits visually jarring artifacts due to inaccurate sensors and post-processing. Cleaning this corrupted data can require substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and time-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the promise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired corrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires access to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often necessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a simple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from unpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method is the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated - through manual labeling or heuristic algorithms - and enable training of quality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality. At test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using the quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple diffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate model, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup models on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to SoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion artifacts. The trained model effectively corrects a wide range of motion artifacts, reducing motion pops and frozen frames by 68% and 81%, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vibhas Vats, Md. Alimoor Reza, David Crandall, Soon-heung Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeju Shin,  Vincent-Daniel, Kyudan Jung, Seongwon Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a key framework for protecting sensitive data in machine learning, but standard DP-SGD often suffers from significant accuracy loss due to injected noise. To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqin Lan, Weihao Shen, Yuanze Hu, Qingchen Yu, Zhaoxin Fan, Faguo Wu, Laurence T. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannu Simonen, Atte Kiviniemi, Hannah Johnston, Helena Barranha, Jonas Oppenlaender</p>
<p>Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image (TTI) generation, images are synthesized from textual prompts. By design, TTI models always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate default images: images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. Studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for prompt engineering and TTI generation. We present the first investigation into default images on Midjourney. We describe an initial study in which we manually created input prompts triggering default images, and several ablation studies. Building on these, we conduct a computational analysis of about 750,000 images, revealing consistent default images across unrelated prompts. We also conduct an online user study investigating how default images may affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI generation, highlighting their practical relevance as well as challenges and future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongliang Li, Jinan Xu, Gengping Cui, Changhao Guan, Fengran Mo, Kaiyu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hangyu Li, Qin Zhao, Haoran Xu, Xinyu Jiang, Qingwei Ben, Feiyu Jia, Haoyu Zhao, Liang Xu, Jia Zeng, Hanqing Wang, Bo Dai, Junting Dong, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Teleoperation is a cornerstone of embodied-robot learning, and bimanual dexterous teleoperation in particular provides rich demonstrations that are difficult to obtain with fully autonomous systems. While recent studies have proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10 held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjiao Feng, Rongxing Xiao, Zonghang Li, Hongfang Yu, Gang Sun, Long Luo, Mohsen Guizani, Qirong Ho, Steve Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Node and link churn in multi-party, cross-region clusters over wide-area networks (WANs) often disrupts distributed training. However, checkpoint-based recovery and cloud-centric autoscaling react slowly and assume centralized control, which is misaligned with the self-governed setup where institutions can freely join and leave. This paper proposes Chaos, a multi-party distributed training system with self-healing and autoscaling, enabling robust and elastic training under churn. It speeds up autoscaling via multi-neighbor state replication and model sharding. We formalize the sharding and assignment as a MINLP that captures WAN heterogeneity, and reduce it to a tractable MILP by analyzing its monotonicity on a divisibility chain. By establishing an equivalence, we derive a greedy algorithm that follows optimality rules and yields the optimal solution in polynomial time. Chaos uses a cluster monitor to track resource and topology changes, and handles scaling events through peer negotiation protocols, enabling fully self-governed autoscaling among institutions. Experiments show that Chaos has substantially lower scale-out delay than Pollux, Elan, and Autoscaling, and handles scale-in, connect-link, and disconnect-link events within 20ms. It also delivers the lowest idle time, showing superior resource use and scalability as the cluster grows.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14864">Balanced and Elastic End-to-end Training of Dynamic LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Wahib, Muhammed Abdullah Soyturk, Didem Unat</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce the computational and memory overhead of Large Language Models, various approaches have been proposed. These include a) Mixture of Experts (MoEs), where token routing affects compute balance; b) gradual pruning of model parameters; c) dynamically freezing layers; d) dynamic sparse attention mechanisms; e) early exit of tokens as they pass through model layers; and f) Mixture of Depths (MoDs), where tokens bypass certain blocks. While these approaches are effective in reducing overall computation, they often introduce significant workload imbalance across workers. In many cases, this imbalance is severe enough to render the techniques impractical for large-scale distributed training, limiting their applicability to toy models due to poor efficiency.
  We propose an autonomous dynamic load balancing solution, DynMo, which provably achieves maximum reduction in workload imbalance and adaptively equalizes compute loads across workers in pipeline-parallel training. In addition, DynMo dynamically consolidates computation onto fewer workers without sacrificing training throughput, allowing idle workers to be released back to the job manager. DynMo supports both single-node multi-GPU systems and multi-node GPU clusters, and can be used in practical deployment. Compared to static distributed training solutions such as Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, DynMo accelerates the end-to-end training of dynamic GPT models by up to 1.23x for MoEs, 3.18x for parameter pruning, 2.23x for layer freezing, 4.02x for sparse attention, 4.52x for early exit, and 1.17x for MoDs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenglin Hua, Jinghan He, Zijun Yao, Tianxu Han, Haiyun Guo, Yuheng Jia, Junfeng Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on multimodal tasks. However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications. Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations. Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions closely associated with faithfulness or hallucination, extracting more precise and disentangled hallucination-related representations. Our analysis demonstrates that interventions along the identified faithful direction can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a plug-and-play method based on SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17108">REMS: a unified solution representation, problem modeling and metaheuristic algorithm design for general combinatorial optimization problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aijuan Song, Guohua Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Zhan, Shixin Zhou, Qianqian Yang, Yixuan Zhao, Hao Liu, Srinivas Chowdary Ramineni, Kenji Shimada</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}), e.g. ChatGPT, have been widely adopted in real-world dialogue applications. However, LLMs' robustness, especially in handling long complex dialogue sessions, including frequent motivation transfer, sophisticated cross-turn dependency, is criticized all along. Nevertheless, no existing benchmarks can fully reflect these weaknesses. We present \textbf{MARS-Bench}, a \textbf{M}ulti-turn \textbf{A}thletic \textbf{R}eal-world \textbf{S}cenario Dialogue \textbf{Bench}mark, designed to remedy the gap. MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary so to feature realistic dialogues specifically designed to evaluate three critical aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn, and Cross-turn Tasks. Extensive experiments on MARS-Bench also reveal that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform open-source alternatives, explicit reasoning significantly boosts LLMs' robustness on handling long complex dialogue sessions, and LLMs indeed face significant challenges when handling motivation transfer and sophisticated cross-turn dependency. Moreover, we provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation when handling long complex dialogue sessions based on attention visualization experiment in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction.</p>

We address this by reformulating POMDPs as fully observable processes with fixed-length observation histories as augmented states. To efficiently encode these histories, we propose a lightweight temporal encoder based on depthwise separable convolution and self-attention, avoiding the overhead of recurrent and Transformer-based models. Integrated into an actor-critic framework, our method achieves superior performance on continuous control benchmarks under partial observability. More broadly, this work shows that lightweight temporal encoding can improve the scalability of AI systems under uncertainty. It advances the development of agents capable of reasoning robustly in real-world environments where information is incomplete or delayed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong Zhang, Ruobing Xie, Yiqing Huang, Jiansheng Chen, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Di Wang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive ``fighting fire with fire'' strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Eyceoz, Nikhil Shivakumar Nayak, Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Akash Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thao Nguyen, Yang Li, Olga Golovneva, Luke Zettlemoyer, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Xian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data. We make our high-quality synthetic data publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/recycling_the_web.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Li, Yuhan Duan, Tianyu Xiong, Yi-Tang Chen, Wei-Lun Chao, Han-Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhao Xu, Georg A. Gottwald, Zdenka Kuncic</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a physical neuromorphic network device can be feasibly optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subham Sekhar Sahoo, Justin Deschenaux, Aaron Gokaslan, Guanghan Wang, Justin Chiu, Volodymyr Kuleshov</p>
<p>Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/duo</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Funing Li, Yuan Tian, Ruben Noortwyck, Jifeng Zhou, Liming Kuang, Robert Schulz</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenghua Cheng, Jinxiang Wang, Sen Wang, Zi Huang, Xue Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Intern\`o, Andrea Castellani, Sebastian Schmitt, Fabio Stella, Barbara Hammer</p>
<p>Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiong Fang, Tianran Sun, Yuling Shi, Min Wang, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cooper Doyle</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA adapt large language models by inserting low-rank adapters, but they leave open two key questions: how to give the adapted model calibrated uncertainty, and how to choose the adapter rank. Existing approaches to uncertainty are typically post-hoc, while rank selection is manual and task-specific. BayesLoRA revisits variational dropout in the LoRA setting and shows that the natural unit of stochasticity is not individual weights but entire ranks of the adapter. By placing rank-wise variational distributions over adapter components, BayesLoRA defines a posterior that (i) yields calibrated predictions through adapter-only Monte Carlo sampling and (ii) prunes redundant ranks automatically via an ARD-style KL term. Theoretical analysis shows that this rank-parameterized posterior localizes uncertainty to the adapted subspace and explains amplification under distribution shift. Empirically, BayesLoRA improves calibration while at the same time producing lighter, faster adapters, removing the need to tune ranks by hand. This dual role of uncertainty estimation and uncertainty-driven pruning suggests BayesLoRA may offer a practical default for reliable and efficient PEFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duxin Chen, Jiawen Chen, Xiaoyu Zhang, Qinghan Jia, Xiaolu Liu, Ye Sun, Linyuan Lv, Wenwu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cosimo Fiorini, Matteo Mosconi, Pietro Buzzega, Riccardo Salami, Simone Calderara</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals, establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungjun Doh, Dong In Lee, Seunggeun Chi, Pin-Hao Huang, Kwonjoon Lee, Sangpil Kim, Karthik Ramani</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoon Pyo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keito Inoshita, Rushia Harada</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model (LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: As text-to-image generative models rapidly improve, AI researchers are making significant advances in developing domain-specific models capable of generating complex medical imagery from text prompts. Despite this, these technical advancements have overlooked whether and how medical professionals would benefit from and use text-to-image generative AI (GenAI) in practice. By developing domain-specific GenAI without involving stakeholders, we risk the potential of building models that are either not useful or even more harmful than helpful. In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Fantacher Islam, Jarrod Mosier, Vignesh Subbian</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies as alternatives to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal is to develop NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making.
  Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 129 classes, 11 object properties, and 17 data properties across 886 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 361 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes: for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Conclusion: We developed an ontology that captures NIRS modalities in a unified framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies, which may need to be expanded to encompass a broader scope.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prital Bamnodkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as catastrophic forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice, and Spaced Repetition, named Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay framework with a mechanism we term the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and the Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to Standard Experience Replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Rate of Penetration (ROP) is pivotal for drilling optimization, yet it remains a persistent challenge due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of drilling data. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture in which input data are first processed through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling operational cycles, and the resulting features are subsequently refined by an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization. Concurrently, the same input is directed to a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block that enables efficient cross-feature modeling of static and categorical attributes such as lithology indices and mud properties. The outputs from the enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer are concatenated, after which an adaptive attention selectively emphasizes the most informative feature representations for accurate ROP prediction. The proposed framework fuses sequential memory, static feature interactions, global contextual learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution to the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Evaluation on a real-world drilling dataset demonstrates benchmark-leading performance, achieving an Rsqaure of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly surpassing standalone and hybrid baselines. Model interpretability is achieved through SHAP and LIME, and comparisons between actual and predicted curves, along with bias checks, confirm the accuracy and fairness of the model across various scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables dependable real-time ROP prediction, supporting the development of intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06165">UR$^2$: Unify RAG and Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitao Li, Boran Xiang, Xiaolong Wang, Zhinan Gou, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Praski, Jakub Adamczyk, Wojciech Czech</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Guo, Fei Zhu, Hongbo Zhao, Fanhu Zeng, Wenzhuo Liu, Shijie Ma, Da-Han Wang, Xu-Yao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip AI systems with the ability to continuously acquire and adapt to new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information, similar to human learning. While traditional continual learning methods focusing on unimodal tasks have achieved notable success, the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models has brought increasing attention to Multimodal Continual Learning tasks involving multiple modalities, such as vision and language. In this setting, models are expected to not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib, we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully selected benchmarks. MCITlib will be continuously updated to reflect advances in the Multimodal Continual Learning field. The codebase is released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/MCITlib.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyue Xie, Da Sun Handason Tam, Wing Cheong Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhua Fang, Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Kaoutar El Maghraoui, Naigang Wang, Meng Wang, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Ibarra, Javier del Riego, Alessandro Catanese, Julian Cuba, Julian Cardona, Nataly Leon, Jonathan Infante, Karim Lekadir, Oliver Diaz, Richard Osuala</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of 22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings. Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangzhan Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Beijun Shen, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing, which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs. The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover, LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wutao Liu, YiDan Wang, Pan Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zhe Wang, Yijun Lin, Zenghao Duan, zhifei zheng, Min Liu, Zhiyi yin, Jianping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Du, Qianwei Huang, Guo Zhu, Zhanchen Dai, Shunian Chen, Qiming Zhu, Le Pan, Minghao Chen, Yuhao Zhang, Li Zhou, Benyou Wang, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex, multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information, Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1) models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g., GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic, workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance, which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude 3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks (recent progress has pushed the frontier further, with RepoMaster+Claude 3.5 achieving a new record of 62.96%). Error analysis attributes over half of failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning, execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex, end-to-end real-world tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Wu, Jinhui Ye, Shuhao Zhang, Lu Dai, Yonatan Bisk, Olexandr Isayev</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Savarese</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity, inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks. The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned.</p>

<p>Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangjing Shao, Benshuang Chen, Chenkang Du, Xueli Liu, Xinrong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost and efficient 3D scene perception in endoscopy. In recent years, a series of methods are proposed to address the illumination inconsistency, while certain works also focus on the generalization of the model by efficiently finetuning the foundation models. However, the variety of illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenges for depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in diverse endoscopy. Firstly, considering the diverse features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetune the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from low-rank experts which are allocated based on the generalization of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with brightness inconsistency and reflectance interference. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art works on SCARED dataset and SimCol dataset. Furthermore, the proposed network also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on C3VD, Hamlyn and SERV-CT dataset. The outstanding performance of our model is further demonstrated with 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation. The proposed method could contribute to accurate endoscopy for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The evaluation codes will be released upon acceptance, while the demo videos can be found on: https://endo-gede.netlify.app/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Pajola, Eugenio Caripoti, Stefan Banzer, Simeone Pizzi, Mauro Conti, Giovanni Apruzzese</p>
<p>Abstract: Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML), including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an (unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends, we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhe Zheng, Zhen-Qun Yang, Haoran Xie, S. Joe Qin, Arlene Chen, Fangzhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanglu Jia, Ceng Zhang, Gregory S. Chirikjian</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Zhao, Lin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahuan Yu, Aryan Taneja, Junfeng Lin, Minjia Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment. This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Hossain, Sai Puppala, Sajedul Talukder, Md Jahangir Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Rashed Albous, Abdel Latef Anouze</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming public-sector processes worldwide, yet standardized measures rarely address the unique drivers, governance models, and cultural nuances of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This study employs a theory-driven foundation derived from an in-depth analysis of literature review and six National AI Strategies (NASs), coupled with a data-driven approach that utilizes a survey of 203 mid- and senior-level government employees and advanced statistical techniques (K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling). By combining policy insights with empirical evidence, the research develops and validates a novel AI Adoption Index specifically tailored to the GCC public sector. Findings indicate that robust technical infrastructure and clear policy mandates exert the strongest influence on successful AI implementations, overshadowing organizational readiness in early adoption stages. The combined model explains 70% of the variance in AI outcomes, suggesting that resource-rich environments and top-down policy directives can drive rapid but uneven technology uptake. By consolidating key dimensions (Technical Infrastructure (TI), Organizational Readiness (OR), and Governance Environment (GE)) into a single composite index, this study provides a holistic yet context-sensitive tool for benchmarking AI maturity. The index offers actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to harmonize large-scale deployments with ethical and regulatory standards. Beyond advancing academic discourse, these insights inform more strategic allocation of resources, cross-country cooperation, and capacity-building initiatives, thereby supporting sustained AI-driven transformation in the GCC region and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Liu, Yuchong Xie, Mingyu Luo, Zesen Liu, Zhixiang Zhang, Kaikai Zhang, Zongjie Li, Ping Chen, Shuai Wang, Dongdong She</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongmin Yu, Susang Kim, Kisu Lee, Taekyoung Kwon, Won-Yong Shin, Ha Young Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens, failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text. MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongheng Guo, Tao Chen, Manuela Ferrario</p>
<p>Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aswini Kumar Patra, Lingaraj Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Friedrich Wolf-Monheim</p>
<p>Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waqar Ahmad, Evan Murphy, Vladimir A. Krylov</p>
<p>Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed. The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD</p>

Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$ faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaeyun Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks are limited in their expressiveness, summarizing complex feature effects as single scalar values \phi_i. This approach answers "what" features are important but fails to reveal "how" they interact. Furthermore, methods that attempt to capture interactions, like those based on Shapley values, often face an exponential computational cost. We present STRIDE, a scalable framework that addresses both limitations by reframing explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal "functional decomposition" in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the tabular setups we study, STRIDE analytically computes functional components f_S(x_S) via a recursive kernel-centering procedure. The approach is model-agnostic and theoretically grounded with results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence. In tabular benchmarks (10 datasets, median over 10 seeds), STRIDE attains a 3.0 times median speedup over TreeSHAP and a mean R^2=0.93 for reconstruction. We also introduce "component surgery", a diagnostic that isolates a learned interaction and quantifies its contribution; on California Housing, removing a single interaction reduces test R^2 from 0.019 to 0.027.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoxi Zhang, Xiaomei Zhang, Yanjun Zhang, He Zhang, Shirui Pan, Bo Liu, Asif Qumer Gill, Leo Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.
  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Huang, Fan Wu, Zeqing Zhang, Qihao Wang, Long Zhang, Grant Michael Boquet, Hongyang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: GeoGPT is an open large language model system built to advance research in the geosciences. To enhance its domain-specific capabilities, we integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG), which augments model outputs with relevant information retrieved from an external knowledge source. GeoGPT uses RAG to draw from the GeoGPT Library, a specialized corpus curated for geoscientific content, enabling it to generate accurate, context-specific answers. Users can also create personalized knowledge bases by uploading their own publication lists, allowing GeoGPT to retrieve and respond using user-provided materials. To further improve retrieval quality and domain alignment, we fine-tuned both the embedding model and a ranking model that scores retrieved passages by relevance to the query. These enhancements optimize RAG for geoscience applications and significantly improve the system's ability to deliver precise and trustworthy outputs. GeoGPT reflects a strong commitment to open science through its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and community driven development. As part of this commitment, we have open-sourced two core RAG components-GeoEmbedding and GeoReranker-to support geoscientists, researchers, and professionals worldwide with powerful, accessible AI tools.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10011">Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA) Using CancelOut Layer and a Projected Loss</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Antoine Oriou, Philipp Krah, Julian Koellermeier</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by working directly within the projection space identified by the network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Pantazopoulos, Eda B. \"Ozyi\u{g}it</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10414">Is In-Context Learning Learning?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian de Wynter</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.</p>
